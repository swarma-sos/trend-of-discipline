AB In order to develop more sustainable and economic production processes for chemical and pharmaceutical products, the focus of academic and industrial research is presently set on the investigation of hybrid separation processes. The combination of classical fluid separation processes with innovative membrane processes especially entails strong synergies. Despite all advantages however, the capability of hybrid sepration processes in industrial scale is hardly exploited because of the lack of general design methodologies and detailed process know-how. Therefore, this paper focuses on modelling, simulation and process analysis of hybrid membrane separations namely on distillation and pervaporation. This hybrid process can be applied for the separation of multicomponent azeotropic mixtures without the use of an entrainer. Its application is illustrated by the separation of a non-ideal ternary mixture of acetone, isopropanol and water. The paper describes a simulation tool for pervaporation and vapour permeation. For the stand-alone membrane process the simulation results are in satisfactory agreement with the gained experimental data. A comparison between different model complexities is presented. The process analysis of the hybrid process shows the influence of decisive operational parameters on process performance and its economic potential.

DE sustainable development
ID INTEGRATED POLLUTION PREVENTION; MODEL
AB Sustainable development presents us all with the challenge of living in ways which are compatible with the long-term constraints imposed by the finite carrying capacity of the closed system which is Planet Earth. The chemical engineering approach to the management of complex systems involving material and energy flows will be essential in meeting the challenge. System-based tools for environmental management already embody chemical engineering principles, albeit applied to broader systems than those which chemical engineering conventionally covers. Clean technology is an approach to process selection, design and operation which combines conventional chemical engineering with some of these system-based environmental management tools; it represents an interesting new direction in the application of chemical engineering to develop more sustainable processes. Less conventional applications of chemical engineering lie in public sector decisions, using the approach known as post-normal science. These applications require chemical engineers to take on a significantly different role, using their professional expertise to work with people from other disciplines and with the lay public. The contribution of chemical engineering to the formation of UK energy policy provides an example of the importance of this role. Recognising the role of engineers as agents of social change implies the need for a different set of skills, which just might make the profession more attractive to potential new recruits.

DE sustainability
AB In the last decade significant progress has been made in recognising and understanding the issues in sustainability. Much remains to be done because the science that underlies sustainability is still far from exact. Given the natural abilities of chemical engineers with systems analysis, balances and modelling, there is a key role for chemical engineering science to play in its development.
   An integrated approach requires addressing cascading levels of sustainability objectives. The levels are global objectives, industry strategy, enterprise targets, specific targets and individual actions/measurement outcomes. We need to consider the reality of the cascade effect-is it possible for global objectives to cascade all the way down to individual actions and what will be the effect of each of the steps between?
   Exploration of the existing metrics and sustainability systems in relation to these cascading levels reveals that there is no single approach that can address both global responsibilities and enterprise and company interests. It is time for a framework for sustainability to be developed that can be used across all scales of application.
   Indicators that address all levels of sustainability goals will enable a paradigm shift, allowing us to move beyond individual problems and to offer options on the pathway to the ultimate solution. Without these indicators it is difficult to translate our broad goals into decision-making processes. Reliable indicators would also assist companies to resist the pressures that work against sustainability, for example, those from investors for short-term returns.
   Chemical engineering has a history of embracing new disciplines and has a special role to play in the change process. An understanding at the micro and molecular levels and the integration of this knowledge into macro systems will be integral to the shift towards process engineering addressing the sustainability framework. Breakthroughs in greenhouse gas reduction, climate change prevention and process redesign will require a strong base of chemical engineering science. I see opportunities for chemical engineers to play a leadership role by collaborating with other industries in building critical mass and contributing to step change beyond best practice, by broadening the scope of the discipline and by restructuring chemical engineering education at an individual level.

AB The pressing need for identification and treatment of behavioral health disorders in primary care has renewed interest in the concept of co-located models of care. The purpose of this article is to describe three North Carolina practice models in which mental health professionals are co-located with pediatric primary care providers. Each of the models was sustainable, partly due to systemic changes brought about by advocacy efforts. In addition to providing practical guidance for possible replication in primary care, this article reflects on how advocacy efforts can impact the success of co-location models.

AB Transferring decision-making process from central to local government and enhancing the role of local communities in managing coastal zones is an increasing commitment by governments in Southeast Asia. This article analyzes decentralized coastal zone management in two neighboring countries, Malaysia and Indonesia. The Federal system in Malaysia is argued to be able to influence more decentralized coastal zone management and to promote community-based management approaches. Meanwhile, the large diversity of coastal resources and communities combined with a still as yet tested decentralization policy in Indonesia is argued to bring more challenges in implementing the decentralization and community-based approaches in coastal zones. The lessons learned in this study provide insight in how far decentralized coastal zone management has taken place in Malaysia and Indonesia. The significant differences in the pattern of coastal zone management in these two countries are discussed in detail. This study recognizes that co-management and community-based approaches can be appropriate in dealing with coastal zone management. This comparative perspective is important to the development of a bigger picture of sustainable coastal zone management processes and cross-regional knowledge-sharing in Southeast Asia.

AB In 1991 the Philippine government shifted many coastal management responsibilities to local governments and fostered increased local participation in the management of coastal resources. In their delivery of integrated coastal management (ICM) as a basic service, many local governments have achieved increasing public awareness of coastal resource management (CRM) issues. Continuing challenges are financial sustainability, inadequate capacities, weak law enforcement, and lack of integrated and collaborative efforts. To address these challenges, a CRM certification system was developed to improve strategies and promote incentives for local governments to support ICM. This system is being applied by an increasing number of local governments to guide the development and implementation of ICM in their jurisdiction. The CRM benchmarks required for a local government to achieve the first level of certification are: budget allocated, CRM related organizations formed and active, CRM plan developed and adopted, shoreline management initiated and two or more best practices implemented. Implementation is providing tangible benefits to communities through enhanced fisheries production associated with MPAs, revenues from user fees and enhanced community pride through learning exchanges and involvement in decisions, among others.

AB The ultimate goal of integrated coastal management (ICM) is to improve the quality of life of coastal inhabitants through achieving the sustainable development objectives. Achieving this goal, however, is often hindered by policy and financial and capacity barriers. This article discusses the role of the interaction between the dynamic forces and essential elements of ICM to address the environmental and management issues at the local level. The experience of Xiamen Municipality, People's Republic of China, is highlighted to showcase how it transformed from an environmentally degraded municipality into a modern, urban garden city in a span of just more than a decade. The socioeconomic and ecological benefits of ICM in Xiamen are obvious, measurable, and well-appreciated by both the government and the citizenry. Useful lessons have also been drawn from several ICM initiatives in East Asia in relation to strengthening coastal management. The key ones are briefly discussed.

AB In order to identify environmental factors driving the distribution and functioning of deep-sea fauna and the spatial scales of interactions, we carried out a multiple-scale investigation in the Mediterranean basin in which we compared two bathyal plains, located at the same depth (ca. 3000 m), but characterised by contrasting trophic conditions. We investigated meiofaunal abundance, biomass, community structure and biodiversity (expressed as richness of taxa) in relation to sediment characteristics, downward fluxes and food availability in the sediment. Samples were collected at all spatial scales (from small to macroscale) in two seasons. Our results indicated that deep-sea systems with different trophic conditions displayed different responses to the distribution of available energy and its spatio-temporal variability in the sediment. The analysis at a macroscale (> 1000 km) indicated that meiofauna were controlled primarily by the trophic inputs to the deepsea system. Spatial variability of meiofaunal parameters at a mesoscale (> 50 km) was highest in the eastern Mediterranean and lowest in the western Mediterranean. Such differences are the consequence of the unpredictable inputs of organic matter in the oligotrophic eastern Mediterranean versus a more homogeneous distribution of food inputs in the mesotrophic western Mediterranean. At a smaller scale (local scale 7 km), in the western Mediterranean, the distribution of meiofaunal parameters was highly homogeneous, reflecting the homogeneous distribution of the food availability in the sediment. Our results indicated that the highly variable input and distribution of food sources in the deep eastern Mediterranean did not provide any "insurance" for the sustainability of the deep-sea faunal assemblages in the long term, thus leading to an uncoupling between resource availability and distribution of organisms. We conclude that the influence of energy availability on the deep-sea faunal distributions change at different spatial scales and that the analysis of spatial variability at mesoscales is crucial for understanding the relationships between deep-sea benthic fauna and environmental drivers.

TI Will 'emerging donors' change the face of international co-operation?
SO DEVELOPMENT POLICY REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB Responding to the recent upsurge of interest in 'emerging donors', this article argues that the DAC share of aid is likely to decline only slowly from what is a historically high level, and at least some non-DAC donors are likely to see DAC approaches and norms as relevant. Nevertheless, low-income countries seem likely to have a wider range of financing options. Three key risks are that: they prejudice their debt situation by borrowing on inappropriate terms; they use low-conditionality aid to postpone necessary adjustment; and they waste resources on unproductive investments. DAC members should develop constructive dialogue with other bilateral donors based on recognition that sustainable development and poverty reduction should be the core purpose of aid.

TI Sustainability of the Slovenian pension system - An analysis with an
   overlapping-generations general equilibrium model
SO EASTERN EUROPEAN ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper uses a dynamic overlapping-generations (OLG) general equilibrium model to analyze welfare effects in Slovenia, the macroeconomic effects of the Slovenian pension reform, and the effects of the pension fund deficit on the sustainability of Slovenian public finances. Although young and new generations will lose from the pension reform, even complete implementation of reforms might not sufficiently compensate for unfavorable demographic developments. The level of expected deficit for the pay-as-you-go state pension fund seems to be most worrying. Financing the pension system with value-added tax revenues, as an extreme case, could result in more sustainable public finances, because gross domestic product and welfare levels ought to increase; however this might be infeasible to implement politically, given that generations of voters would have their welfare decreased. In addition, the present pension system is opaque and tremendously complicated and primarily, should be made more comprehensible to the public.

AB The paper examines the solvency of Turkey regarding its external debts. Recent economic crises Turkey faced in last decade raised concerns on the issue of external debt sustainability. Using the usual intertemporal budget constraint, a statistically testable measure of solvency is derived and the methodology of Hakkio and Rush (Hakkio, C. S., Rush, M., 1991. Is the budget deficit 'too large'? Economic Inquiry 29, 429-445.) is followed to evaluate the sustainability of the external debt of Turkey. In addition to the conventional cointegration tests, Zivot-Andrews (Zivot, E., Andrews, D.W.K., 1992. Further evidence on the great crash, the oil price shock, and the unit root hypothesis. Journal of Business and Economic Statistics 10, 251-270.) unit root test and Gregory-Hansen (Gregory, A., Hansen, B., 1996. Residual based tests for cointegration in models with regime shifts. Journal of Econometrics 70, 99-126.) cointegration test are also employed to find out whether a possible structural break that may be due to the recent economic crises in Turkey changes the empirical results. The findings show that with or without considering any structural break, Turkish external debt is weakly sustainable. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Energy conservation, pollution prevention, resource efficiency, systems integration and life cycle costing are very important terms for sustainable construction. The purpose of this work is to ensure a power supply for the north of the Solar Energy Institute building environment lamps by using wind power to comply with the green building approach. Beside this, the study is to present an energy analysis of the 1.5 kW small wind turbine system (SWTS) with a hub height of 12 m above ground level with a 3 in rotor diameter in Turkey. The SWTS was installed at the Solar Energy Institute of Ege University (latitude 38.24 N, longitude 27.50 E), Izmir, Turkey. NACA 63-622 profile type (National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics) blades of epoxy carbon fiber reinforced plastics were used. The system was commissioned in September 2002, and performance tests have been conducted since then. The performance analysis of the SWTS is quantified and illustrated in the tables, particularly for a reference temperature of 25 degrees C, 30th of October 2003 till 5th of November 2003 for comparison purposes. Test results show that when the average wind speed is 7.5 m/s, 616 W and 76 Hz electricity is produced by the alternator. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE governance; hydrogen economy; energy innovation
AB There is a lack of integrated knowledge on the transition to a sustainable energy system. The paper focuses on the relationship between technologies and institutions in the field of hydrogen from the perspective of political theory. The paper unfolds four paradigms of governance: 'Governance by policy networking', Governance by government', 'Governance by corporate business', and 'Governance by challenge', and looks into the major line of argument in support of these paradigms and into their possible bias with respect to hydrogen options. Each of these paradigms reveals an institutional bias in that it articulates specific opportunities for collaboration and competition in order to stimulate the transition to a sustainable hydrogen economy. The paper makes the observation that there is a compelling need to reframe fashionable discourse such as the necessary shift from government to governance or from government to market. Instead, specific questions with respect to the impact of guiding policy frameworks on innovation will highlight that neither 'neutral' nor 'optimal' frameworks for policy making exist, where competing hydrogen options are at stake. The identification of paradigms of governance maybe considered a methodological device for (participator) policy analysis. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE hydrogen; alternative fuels; energy systems analysis
AB Considering the enormous ecological and economic importance of the transport sector the introduction of alternative fuels-together with drastic energy efficiency gains-will be a key to sustainable mobility, nationally as well as globally. However, the future role of alternative fuels cannot be examined from the isolated perspective of the transport sector. Interactions with the energy system as a whole have to be taken into account. This holds both for the issue of availability of energy sources as well as for allocation effects, resulting from the shift of renewable energy from the stationary sector to mobile applications. With emphasis on hydrogen as a transport fuel for private passenger cars, this paper discusses the energy systems impacts of various scenarios introducing hydrogen fueled vehicles in Germany. It identifies clear restrictions to an enhanced growth of clean hydrogen production from renewable energy sources (RES). Furthermore, it points at systems interdependencies that call for a priority use of RES electricity in stationary applications. Whereas hydrogen can play an increasing role in transport after 2030 the most important challenge is to exploit short-mid-term potentials of boosting car efficiency. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

DE hydrogen; sustainable energy systems; energy efficiency
AB The role of hydrogen in long run sustainable energy scenarios for the world and for the case of Germany is analysed, based on key criteria for sustainable energy systems. The possible range of hydrogen within long-term energy scenarios is broad and uncertain depending on assumptions on used primary energy, technology mix, rate of energy efficiency increase and costs degression ("learning effects"). In any case, sustainable energy strategies must give energy efficiency highest priority combined with an accelerated market introduction of renewables ("integrated strategy"). Under these conditions hydrogen will play a major role not before 2030 using natural gas as a bridge to renewable hydrogen. Against the background of an ambitious CO2-reduction goal which is under discussion in Germany the potentials for efficiency increase, the necessary structural change of the power plant system (corresponding to the decision to phase out nuclear energy, the transformation of the transportation sector and the market implementation order of renewable energies ("following efficiency guidelines first for electricity generation purposes, than for heat generation and than for the transportation sector")) are analysed based on latest sustainable energy scenarios.

DE hydrogen; energy sector; energy supply chain
AB The focus of the paper concerns the current discussion on the contribution of the hydrogen economy to a "sustainable energy system". It considers whether advantages for the environmental situation and energy carrier supply can be expected from the already visible future characteristics of hydrogen as a new secondary energy carrier.
   Possible production paths for hydrogen from hydrocarbon-based, renewable or carbon-reduced/-free primary energy carriers are evaluated with respect to primary energy use and CO2 emissions from the fuel cycle. Hydrogen has to be packaged by compression or liquefaction, transported by surface vehicles or pipelines, stored and transferred to the end user. Whether generated by electrolysis or by reforming, and even if produced locally at filling stations, the gaseous or liquid hydrogen has to undergo these market processes before it can be used by the customer. In order to provide an idea of possible markets with special emphasis on the German energy sector, a technical systems analysis of possible hydrogen applications is performed for the stationary, mobile and portable sector. Furthermore, different "business as usual" scenarios are analysed for Germany, Europe and the World concerning end energy use in different sectors. The very small assumed penetration of hydrogen in the analysed scenarios up to the year 2050 indicates that the hydrogen economy is a long-term option.
   With reference to the assumed supply paths and analysed application possibilities, hydrogen can be an option for clean energy use if hydrogen can be produced with carbon-reduced or -free primary energy carriers like renewable energy or biomass. However, the energetic use of hydrogen competes with the direct use of clean primary energy and/or with the use of electric energy based on renewable primary energy. As a substitution product for other secondary energy carriers hydrogen is therefore under pressure of costs and/or must have advantages in comparison to the use of traditional energy carriers.

TI Electricity intensity backstop level to meet sustainable backstop supply

SO ENERGY POLICY

DT Article
DE electricity intensity; price elasticity; sustainable energy supply
AB The concept of a backstop level of electricity intensity(1) is introduced and illustrated for the highest income economies of the world. The backstop level corresponds with the intensity that would be triggered by applying end-use electricity prices equal to the cost price of a fully sustainable electricity supply.
   Section 1 of the paper discusses the issue of electricity (also energy) intensity of economies. It is argued that identifying a "demand for electricity intensity" bridges the gap between the high willingness to pay for electricity services on the one hand and the disinterested attitude of consumers regarding the invisible and impalpable product electricity on the other hand. Assessment of the demand curve for electricity intensity in a cross section of high income OECD countries comes to a long-run price elasticity of almost -1.
   Section 2 revives Nordhaus' concept of backstop supply technologies for weighing three power sources (fossil, nuclear, and renewable sources) in meeting today's criteria of sustainable backstop technology. Only renewable sources meet the main sustainability criteria, but the economic cost of a fully sustainable electricity supply will be elevated.
   The closing question of Section 3, that is, whether the countries can afford the high cost of backstop electricity supplies, is answered by indicating what reductions in intensity are required to keep the electricity bills stable. The targeted intensity level is called the backstop level, and provides a fixed point for electricity efficiency policies. The analysis supports the call for comprehensive and enduring tax reform policies. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study aims to identify and evaluate the biomass utilization options and evaluate the sustainable biomass production for combined heat and power (CHP) in Turkey. The total biomass energy potential of Turkey is about 32 Mtoe. The amount of usable biomass potential of Turkey is approximately 17 Mtoe. Among the biomass energy sources, fuel wood seems to be one of the most interesting because its share of the total energy production of Turkey is high at 21%. The use of biofuels for CHP on a large scale is focused mainly on forest industry sites, where considerable quantities of biomass are available. Biomass available for energy can be converted to different types of final energy (e.g., electricity, heat), of these, the production of electricity appears to be particularly important. While CHP provides several environmental benefits by making use of waste heat and waste products, air pollution is a concern any time fossil fuels or biomass are burned.

AB The inherent technical, economic, and environmental benefits of hydroelectric power make it an important contributor to the future world energy mix, particularly in the developing countries. Technically feasible hydropower estimated at nearly 15,000 TWh/yr still exists in the world today, mostly in countries where increased power supplies from clean and renewable sources are most urgently needed to progress social and economic development. This article deals with policies to meet increasing energy demand for electricity and domestic heating in Turkey. Air-pollutant emissions due to power generation and their harmful effects on the environment are also presented. We also argue in favor of small-scale dams for sustainable development. Turkey has a total gross hydropower potential of 433 GWh/yr, but only 125 GWh/yr of the total hydroelectric potential of Turkey can be economically used. By the commissioning of new hydropower plants, which are under construction, 36% of the economically usable potential of the country would be tapped. On the other hand, Turkey's total economically usable small hydropower potential is 3.75 GWh/yr.

TI Sustainable land reuse: the influence of different stakeholders in

SO ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING A-ECONOMY AND SPACE

DT Article
AB The UK government has made the sustainable reuse of land a strong policy aim in its sustainable development and planning strategies. However, in this paper we present research into recent urban brownfield redevelopments in England that shows that many aspects of sustainability are currently not being considered in practice. To explain this, we focus on the role of different stakeholders involved in brownfield development and critically examine their actions and decisions. We establish which stakeholder types (for example, architects, planners, councillors, developers, investors) are more likely to attempt to introduce sustainability into development projects and which are more successful in meeting their agendas. We conclude by identifying five reasons for variation in the achievement of sustainability in brownfield development.

AB The current centralized systems for sewage treatment are highly efficient with respect to the removal of COD and nutrients and the production of an effluent that can be discharged on surface water. However, from an environmental point of view the sewage treatment process is still far from being environmentally sustainable. Based on a desk study, a structural approach is given on how to achieve a more sustainable treatment process. One of the possibilities is to improve the mitigation of toxic pollutants. Using the appropriate treatment steps, including also high-temperature sludge treatment processes and membrane separation processes, it is possible to remove toxic organic pollutants completely. Heavy metals can be immobilized in a solid matrix. N- and P-containing compounds can be recovered for reuse. Other nonpolluting or slightly polluting organic compounds can be beneficially used as energy sources. Furthermore, both the emissions of the greenhouse gas CO2 and of NO2 to the atmosphere can be substantially reduced. It will be evident that further study and research is necessary to develop the mentioned sustainable treatment scenarios to practical application.

AB The Rio Artiguas basin in central Nicaragua shows a distinctive case of environmental deterioration due to anthropogenic activities. Heavy metals used in gold mining and other wastes are continuously released into the rivers, representing a threat to the water quality. This article aims to evaluate the groundwater intrinsic vulnerability in the Rio Artiguas basin and to provide information for sustainable use of water resources. The DRASTIC and GOD methods were used to analyse the relative pollution potential within the basin. DRASTIC was modified to include the degree of influence that geological structures have on the vulnerability. Moderate vulnerability areas cover most of the basin along stream valleys and lowlands, increasing downstream in the basin. The resulting vulnerability maps show that the limited groundwater resources are susceptible to surface water pollution as high vulnerability areas converge along the river valleys.

TI Danish experiences on EIA of livestock projects
SO ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REVIEW

AB Since its introduction into Danish planning in 1989, Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) has been widely discussed. At the centre of the debate has been the question of whether EIA actually offered anything new and there has been a great deal of scepticism about the efficacy of the instrument, especially when it comes to livestock projects.
   In an evaluation of the Danish EIA experience, we have looked more closely at how the EIA instruments function regarding livestock projects. This article addresses both the EIA process as well as the EIA screening. It is demonstrated that the EIA screening in its own right is a kind of regulatory instrument.
   Examining the assessments made during screening more closely, we conclude that there is still some way to go in order to make the assessment broader and more holistic in accordance with the ambitions set out in the EIA directive to contribute to a more sustainable development. Although the provisions laid down are the same the praxis related to the field has developed at a considerable speed. In order to understand this development we have closely examined how the decisions made by the Nature Protection Board of Appeal (NPBA) have been changed and conclude that these changes definitely address some of the shortcomings found in the evaluation.

AB This paper examined the factors that might influence participating farmers' willingness-to-pay for the Tree Farming Fund (TFF) established for sustainable development of participatory forest management (PFM). Information on willingness-to-pay, socioeconomic characteristics, and attitudes of participating farmers toward TFF were obtained from interviews with 581 participating farmers. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the dominant factors that might influence participating farmers' willingness-to-pay for the TFF. The results showed that participating farmers' willingness-to-pay was significantly affected by (i) family income; (ii) education level; (iii) confidence that his aspired benefits will be received; (iv) agreement with the statement that 'PFM is sustainable under the present state of management'; (v) agreement with the statement that 'PFM is a good strategy for forest conservation'; and (vi) knowledge of PFM strategies. Thus, participating farmers with a higher level of education, higher income and positive attitudes toward TFF tended to express more willingness-to-pay. Establishment of TFF could be an effective strategy in implementing sustainable PFM in Bangladesh. For this strategy to succeed, however, active partnership between the participating farmers and Forest Department is required. Participating farmers' attitudes toward TFF should therefore be taken into consideration as should the results of this study, which are important indicators of participating farmers' positive attitudes toward TFF.

SO ERNAHRUNGS-UMSCHAU

DT Article
DE agrarian policy; turnaround; consumption patterns; organic food
AB The fundamental shift in agrarian policy ("Agrarwende") which was proclaimed by the former red-green government has led to a social upgrading of organic food. This opens up many chances for organic farmers but also means new challenges in many respects.
   Although the expansion of organic farming, in terms of quantity, and of sales of organic products remained much behind the target envisaged, a new dynamic push has been given to organic food markets, especially by the introduction of a new eco-label by the government in 2002. The new label has considerably accelerated the expansion of the markets for organic food on the European level. Bio-Supermarkets and conventional food retailers including discounters now are the most important distributors of organic food. Increasing differentiation both among farmers and retailers (providing organic food) is responsible for the fact that the ideologically integrated networks of the small, organic food sector are no longer strictly separated from the conventional food sector. In addition, the rapid expansion of supply and trade of organic food on a European scale increases the competitive pressure on organic farmers and small retailers, urging them towards a more pragmatic market-orientation.
   Adaptation to conventional structures and a stronger economic orientation endanger the trustworthiness and the special quality profile of organic products, however. In the eyes of many consumers the promise of "additional benefits" of organic farming in terms of environmental protection, adequate lifestock management, preservation of countryside, and promotion of regional economies is jeopardized. Thus a new management of ethical values among organic food-retailers and an intensive public debate on a new line of approach to sustainable agriculture and nutrition are required to ensure sustainable growth of organic farming in Germany.

AB Direct-seeding or no-till is defined as planting directly into residue of the previous crop without tillage that mixes or stirs soil prior to planting. No-till reduces soil erosion, improves soil structure and organic matter, and reduces fuel inputs. No-till is widely used in cereal production in Australia, Canada, Argentina, and Brazil, but has not been widely adopted in Europe and the Pacific Northwest of the U.S. One of the limitations is that root diseases may increase with a reduction in tillage. This paper discusses the importance and management of take-all, Fusarium dryland foot rot, Rhizoctonia bare patch and root rot, and Pythium root rot in dryland cereal production systems, and how they are influenced by changes in tillage practices. To address this challenge, specifically with Rhizoctonia and Pythium, our research group has (1) developed classical and molecular techniques to detect and quantify Rhizoctonia and Pythium spp. from the soil to assess disease risk; (2) studied the disease dynamics of root disease during the transition from conventional to no-till; (3) developed greenhouse methods to screen germplasm for tolerance or resistance to Pythium and Rhizoctonia, and (4) using GPS and geostatistics, has examined the spatial distribution of R. solani and R. oryzae at a field scale up to 36 ha, across a number of crop rotations and years. By a combination of ecological, epidemiological, field, and laboratory studies, we hope to provide growers with a set of disease management tools to permit the economical and sustainable production of dryland cereals without degradation of the soil resource.

AB A two-year study was conducted to determine the effect of six sanitation treatments on leaf litter density (LLD), relative ascospore production of Venturia inaequalis and scab incidence on spur-leaf clusters, leaves and harvested fruits, on two cultivars with low and high scab susceptibilities, in Hungarian integrated and organic apple orchards. The following sanitation treatments were used: sprays of lime sulphur in autumn, collecting fallen leaves in autumn, straw mulch cover in late winter, sprays of lime sulphur followed by mulch cover, collecting fallen leaves followed by mulch cover, collecting fallen leaves followed by covering the orchard floor with plastic foil, and non-sanitized control. LLD decreased continuously in all treatment plots by 0-23% by mid-May in both orchards and years; however, LLD reduction was 1.4-4.2 times higher in the organic orchard compared to the integrated one. All treatments, except for the lime sulphur treatment, resulted in significant (P < 0.05) reduction of LLD and ascospore production in both the integrated and organic apple orchards compared to non-sanitized plots. The most efficient treatment was leaf collection combined with plastic foil cover, followed by leaf collection combined with mulch cover, leaf collection alone, mulch cover alone, and lime sulphur spray combined with mulch cover, with a reduction in the ascospore production of > 95, 72-92, 56-79, 24-38, and 27-46%, respectively, in the mean of both orchards and years. However, only treatments of leaf collection applied alone, or in combination with mulch or with plastic foil cover reduced significantly (P < 0.05) leaf and/or fruit scab incidence by 18-57% compared to non-sanitized plots. These three leaf collection treatments are recommended in both integrated and organic orchards and the possibilities of successfully incorporating these methods into orchard management practices are interpreted.

TI Urban development in peripheral regions of the new Europe: The case of
   Vigo in Galicia
SO EUROPEAN PLANNING STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB The paper discusses the development of peripheral cities and regions in a world where economic integration is growing. The paper argues that the development of peripheral cities and regions depends on their development potential and accessibility to markets. Their sustainable development, however, lies in the functioning of the forces of development: the organization of the productive system, the diffusion of innovation, the territory's urban development and the change and adaptation of the institutional system. These are forces that govern the economic growth process, generate externalities, and reduce production costs through reciprocal interaction. The paper's discussion is based on the analysis of the dynamics of the city of Vigo in Galicia, a peripheral region of the European Union.

ID STANDARD CASE-MANAGEMENT; ILLNESS
AB Purpose. - Data on the process of mental health care is scant. Most studies focus on services at their inception when activity may be atypical and then usually present data only mean values for the reported variables over the whole study period. We aimed to test whether care delivery changes over time, and to describe any changes at the individual patient and team levels.
   Methods. - Process data on 272 patients in three new intensive case management (ICM) teams were collected over 2 years. Interventions were prospectively recorded using clinician-derived categories. Changes over time are described at both patient and team level.
   Results. - The number of contacts and the proportion of face-to-face activity were remarkably constant after the first month at the patient level. The proportion of 'psychiatric' interventions (main focus on medication or a specific 'mental health' intervention performed) increased greatly after the first 6 months. The care activity received by individual patients varied considerably. Overall, teams varied significantly in the extent to which their activity rates were sustained over time.
   Conclusions. - New ICM teams deliver highly individualised care with more marked differences in treatment patterns between patients in the same team than mean differences between teams. The early 'engagement' period is marked by a greater focus on social care. There is evidence of differences in sustainability of the services by site. (c) 2005 Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Existing animal models of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) present several problems: they are hard to reproduce, they are inefficient, and the CNV created is not sustainable. The purpose of this study is to develop a highly efficient, reliable, sustainable rabbit model of CNV to facilitate the study of anti-angiogenic and anti-proliferative therapies for ocular diseases. Twenty-two pigmented rabbits were used in this study. Eleven rabbits received subretinal injections of either 10 mu l of Matrigel with 500 ng of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or 20 mu l of Matrigel with 750 ng of VEGF; eight rabbits received subretinal injections of either 10 or 20 mu l of Matrigel only; three rabbits used as controls received subretinal injections of 20 pi phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) alone. Fundus photography, fluorescein angiography, optical coherence tomography, and histologic examinations were performed 1, 2, 4, and 9 weeks after injection. All experimental eyes showed angiographic leakage within this localized area I week after injection. The amount of leakage usually increased at weeks 2 and 4 and, in most cases, persisted at week 9. Control eyes demonstrated no leakage at any time point. Optical coherence tomography of treated eyes showed subretinal fluid and the presence of a lesion, possibly vascular or fibrotic, at the site of the leakage. Histologic analysis confirmed the presence of new subretinal blood vessels in the areas of Matrigel deposit. In conclusion, this novel method provides a highly reproducible, reliable, and sustainable rabbit model of experimental choroidal neovascularization. Such a model may prove useful for screening new anti-angiogenic therapies in a larger animal eye. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The high productivity associated with many tropical forest plantation species has contributed to their importance in meeting the world's growing demand for wood products. However, there is concern that their high growth rate and intensive management system might lead to site nutrients depletion. A total of 20 stands (10-28 years) of Gmelina arborea plantations in Oluwa and Omo forest reserves, Nigeria, was used to investigate the effect of Gmelina plantation development on site nutrients, aboveground productivity and nutrient accumulation. Standing biomass ranged from 81.5 to 392.1 t ha(-1) in the youngest and oldest stands. Regardless of stand age, biomass partitioning was about 83.0, 13.5 and 3.5% to stem, branches and foliage, respectively. The size and age of trees did not significantly affect nutrient concentration in tree components. Nitrogen, Ca and Mg contents in tree tissue increased in the order of foliage > stem > branches while that of K and P increased in the order of foliage > branches > stem. Tree tissue nutrients concentration exhibited little change with stand development. Stand nutrient accumulation followed the same trend as standing biomass, with about 80% of each nutrient stored in the stem and 20% in branches and foliage. The accumulation of nutrients in stem, branches and foliage followed the order: Mg > N > Ca > P > K > Na. Though soil nutrients were slightly depleted between 10 and 19 years and re-built up afterwards, the overall effect of stand development on soil nutrients was not statistically significant, implying that the development of Gmelina plantations did not adversely affect the soil nutrient status. Consequently, productivity during the next rotation will most likely be affected by harvesting methods of current stands and management practices of the next rotation. The 20% accumulation of aboveground nutrients in branches and foliage implies that apart from the already replenished site nutrients, there will be an additional 20% nutrient input into the soil if the branches and foliage are left on the site after harvest. For long-term site quality and sustainability of production, successive plantations should be managed on 25 years rotation as lower rotation will most likely lead to steady depletion of site nutrients.

AB The John Prince Research Forest (JPRF) was established as a co-managed forest between Tl'azt'en Nation and the University of Northern British Columbia, as an opportunity for these partners to blend their respective ways of understanding and managing forests to contribute to ecological and social sustainability Using four criteria of successful co-management reported in the literature as critical to the early stages of partnership - partnership building, institutional structure, decision-making, and capacity - we discuss the JPRF's performance during the first half-decade of its existence. The JPRF's early experience provides an example of the evolution of a co-management relationship that, while facing constraints and challenges in regard to some of the criteria, has provided the foundation for a strong future partnership.

AB With the recent involvement of a greater diversity of groups working in forest management planning, the identification and understanding of people's forest values and their perceptions of one another's values may be a promising approach to sustainable forest management. This study identifies and analyzes the forest values and perceptions of the members of four groups, Aboriginal People, Environmental Non-Government Organizations (ENGOs), the forest industry, and the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources (OMNR), in northwestern Ontario. Conceptual Content Cognitive Mapping (3CM) was used to identify people's forest values and perceptions and dominant forest value themes were created using hierarchical clustering. Inter-group and intra-group similarities and differences among the rankings of participants' forest values and their perceptions were determined through various non-parametric statistical tests. Participants' perceptions about each group were generally similar, which included the two most prominent themes to be similar across all participants' perceptions of each group. Although the perceptions for a particular group were similar across the participant groups, they differed substantially with that participant group's personal ranking of the forest value themes.

AB In this study, we explore alternative strategies available to the Little Red River Cree Nation for meeting their projected socio-economic needs using the natural resources to which they have access. We analyze outcomes from mathematical programming models for various forest policy regimes, ranging from current sustained-yield management to sustainable forest management. The potential outcomes of the two approaches are analyzed using financial returns, harvest volumes and ecological impacts. Results indicate that decision-makers face significant trade-offs in determining an appropriate management strategy for the forest lands they control. Our main conclusion is that economic development strategies for First Nations must diversify away from forest resources in the long run if they are to be successful.

AB 1. One important goal in conservation biology is to characterise evolutionary lineages within endangered species before management decisions are taken. Here, we assess population differentiation in the freshwater crayfish Austropotamobius pallipes, an endangered species endemic to western Europe and provide valuable information for the conservation of French populations.
   2. Analysis of five microsatellite loci in 44 populations revealed very different within population levels of genetic diversity (0.000 < H-0 < 0.564). Two groups, corresponding to northern and southern French populations, showed a high degree of genetic differentiation in both allele frequencies and allele sizes. Comparison of these results with previous studies of A. pallipes strongly suggests that the divergence between northern and southern populations could have occurred during the last glaciation period of the Pleistocene from one Atlantic and one Mediterranean refuge.
   3. Evidence for genetic admixture between these two lineages was revealed by correspondence analyses in southern populations, probably as the result of artificial translocations.
   4. French populations appeared significantly differentiated among the different river drainages and were highly structured within rivers. The impact of population size, population bottlenecks and founder events on the population genetic differentiation are discussed.
   5. Based on these results, we propose the designation of two evolutionarily significant units for A. pallipes in France. Our data also support the maintenance of separate demographic management strategies for crayfish inhabiting different river systems. However, genetic analyses will have to be combined with demographic and ecological data for sustainable conservation programmes.

AB There is a strong domestic and industrial market for charcoal in the UK and is still used in many developing countries for cooking and heating as well as for many industrial applications. It is usually made in small-scale simple kilns that are very damaging to the environment, very inefficient and labour intensive. The Charcoal, Heat and Power (CHaP) process offers a method for producing clean efficient charcoal under pressurised conditions and uses the product gas from the carbonisation process to drive a small gas turbine to produce heat and power. The charcoal is produced using waste forestry matter and other waste wood, including that from sustainably managed forests. The CHaP system can also be used in developing countries where there is an excess of forestry waste and a shortage of fossil fuels.
   The CHaP process was initially designed, developed and a prototype system built. This paper discusses the CHaP design and the various components used, their separate development and integration into a system. Tests showed the process successfully produced a high quality charcoal and the product gas effectively used to drive a gas turbine. The CHaP technology was proven and a new novel system of producing charcoal under pressurised conditions was created coupled with a novel use of the product gas whose output was green heat and power. The initial CHaP prototype showed the process was capable of producing low emissions and is virtually carbon neutral. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID TRANSLATING EVIDENCE; HEALTH-CARE; TELEPHONE
AB Objective: Inconsistent third-party reimbursement for depression care management is a significant economic barrier to the utilization and sustainability of the chronic illness care model in primary care practice settings. We review common mechanisms used to procure payment for depression care management services, discuss obstacles encountered and suggest future directions.
   Method: We describe several extant models for funding depression care management services in use at the demonstration sites of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation funded "Depression in Primary Care" project and similar programs. We derived this information from ongoing discussions with the sites' project directors and through an extensive electronic literature search on "care management, funding mechanisms and depression."
   Results: Funding mechanisms include (a) practice-based care management on a fee-for-service basis, (b) practice-based care management under contract to health plans, (c) global capitation, (d) flexible infrastructure support for chronic care management, (e) health-plan-based care management, (0 third-party-based care management under contract to health plans and (g) hybrid models.
   Conclusions: While substantial obstacles remain in the way of fully implementing these depression care management funding mechanisms (e.g., variations in care managers' credentials and work locations and third-party payer concerns about overutilization and transaction costs), several recent policy advances provide some optimism for the potential adoption of financial mechanisms to support and disseminate these evidence-based practices.

AB A company's reputation is a vital asset in building stakeholder trust; a resource that, given the risk of public scandal threatening every enterprise in today's information society, is nothing less than existential. No company can afford to abandon itself to the whims of public opinion; all must actively strive wherever possible to shape reputational opportunities and risks in their own best interest. Professional reputation management has quite simply become every company's duty. This article situates reputation management in the context of corporate values, corporate governance, corporate responsibility and the "triple bottom line''; in the context, that is, of the most fundamental elements of corporate policy. Indeed, only such a holistic approach can do justice to the complexity of the reputation phenomenon. In our reflections on the implementation of reputation management, we will be using Swiss Re as a concrete example, demonstrating in a detailed manner the relevant institutions, instruments and tasks. This implementation question involves a number of issues: corporate citizenship, sustainability management and corporate compliance, among others - but perhaps most importantly, the role reputation plays in a company's sustainable economic success.

AB Reputation is an intangible asset that directly affects the market value of the firm. Although reputation evidences belief that the firm is on a sustainable course, it is built on the trust established with all stakeholders through past proper behaviour. It proves more resilient than one might think at first but even menial misconducts, if repeated, can lead to a downfall. The demise of a few can engulf a whole industry when the transactions are based on trust in the fulfilment of future promises. This is why reputation has become an object of research for several branches of management sciences. The key drivers are still in need of refinement. Nevertheless, they can be summarized in one word: authenticity.

AB This article describes the turn to new integrative water management strategies in the Netherlands. It illustrates that some of the new and the general objectives and principles are not easily applied in practice. First, the article focuses on the development of integrative management of water and spatial development. A main policy line, the 'Room for the River' directive, was originally an ad hoc reaction to unexpected floods, but accompanied by other policy reforms it grew into an application of the river basin approach with an emphasis on its spatial consequences. The resulting Space-Water-Adjustment Management Principle (SWAMP) emphasizes the mutual adjustments in policy that must be made in both water policy and spatial development. Officially, water is proclaimed as an ordering element, yet actual spatial developments still follow lines of economic and social priorities as executed by institutional powers. Three case studies are presented to illustrate the emergence of new principles and governance issues linked to these management approaches. In practice, the paper concludes, spatial planning and land use decisions show a centralization tendency that is not in line with the proclaimed prevalence of local identity, resilience and open decentralized and deliberative governance in the SWAMP-based integrated river basin management.

AB In 1997 there was a change in government in the UK with the Labour Party coming into power for the first time since 1979. Among the commitments made was the intention to put sustainability at the heart of government and decision-making. There was also a commitment to introduce reforms of the utility sector. In part this was a response to public concern over the conduct and behaviour of the privatised utilities,,made more pertinent in the case of the water sector by the impact of several seasons of below average rainfall and high levels of leakage. In light of this the need for change took on a particular urgency. This paper examines some of the developments in water regulation under the 1997-2001 Labour administration. Through two sets of events; the 1997 Water Summit and the 1997-1999 Price Review the paper examines the discursive processes through which sustainability has been incorporated into water regulation. It discusses the changes in the practices of regulation and whether these could be characterised as the adoption of sustainability by the water sector or a strategy of adaptation to accommodate sustainability within an existing economic paradigm.

AB Despite wide ranging interpretations of the concept of sustainable development there is growing consensus about the ecological, social, and economic conditions necessary to foster a sustainability transition. In addition to quantitative assessments of sustainability indicators, qualitative process indicators are being identified. For example, active, democratic, and inclusive decision-making are shown to lead to more informed decisions and, presumably, more sustainable use systems. The creation of these conditions, however, often requires bridging lack of mutual trust and scientific uncertainty. And while the ideals of sustainable development suggest that all stakeholders get what they want, without compromise nothing approaching sustainable development is attainable. Obstructing compromise, environmental ideology represents a key remaining hurdle to achieving a middle ground in environment and development debates. In the 1990s, the US-based Trillium Corporation sought to implement a large-scale logging project in Tierra del Fuego, Chile, but was rebuffed by environmentalists who embraced ecotourism as the preferred development option. The case is analyzed in the context of calls to reconsider conceptually nature-society relationships and ideas in sustainability science about which land management systems best match sustainability goals. Findings show that the decision-making process for determining whether or not to implement the logging project was flawed. We explore two implications. First, achieving sustainable development requires a consensus view of nature-society relationships that embraces humanized landscapes. Second, inclusive and effective decision-making about sustainable development necessitates free and open exchange of information, collective learning about regional environment and development, and the identification of compromise positions.

AB This paper responds to challenges made by Castree [Castree, N., 2004. Environmental issues: signals in the noise? Progress in Human Geography 28 (1), 79-90] and Sneddon [Sneddon, C., 2000. 'Sustainability' in ecological economics, ecology and livelihoods: a review. Progress in Human Geography 24 (4), 521-549] for human geography to clarify its contribution to environmental debates and engage with recent formulations of sustainability as informed by the 'new ecology'. This approach focuses on resilience, functional diversity, flexibility and complexity, here used to examine housing sustainability within an industrialised sub/urban context in terms of design philosophy.. ownership, management bases, community engagement and funding mechanisms. This framework highlights areas of concern for enhancing the functional diversity of housing systems, echoing recent assertions that challenges for sustainability arise more from trust and power sharing issues, than from physical design and maintenance issues. It is argued that it is precisely human geography's place-by-place consideration of power, embeddedness, scale and politics that can lend new ecology the social relevance it requires.

   development policy in post-war Britain
SO GEOFORUM
LA English

DE regional policy; key workers; labour mobility; community
ID POLITICS; URBAN
AB Spatial and planning policies in Britain have increasingly become focused on regional inequalities and the creation of mixed, sustainable and balanced communities. Within these new policy paradigms the category of the key workers has emerged as an essential element in the socio-economic sustainability of any bounded area programmes have been introduced to support their needs. Yet, defining key workers is an inherently political process as it necessitates the selection of essential and non-essential workers. Theoretical approaches that highlight state selectivity and the ways in which key policy subjects and objects are identified and mobilised have become increasingly popular across the social sciences and key worker support programmes provide a clear example of these processes in action. This paper draws on archival research to explore the formation of the category 'key' worker as an object of government in spatial development policies of the post-war period. It examines how key worker programmes were established to tackle the economic problems of Development Areas. It argues that definitions of key workers were forged in and through particular social, political, and economic contexts and that their emergence as an object of government presupposed and reinforced the existence of different classes of workers and different types of citizens. The paper highlights the significance of such historical work in assessments of contemporary policy and academic debates concerning the changing character of sustainable communities and citizenship, regional development, and changing modes of state regulation.

AB The controlled-source dual horizontal-loop harmonic electromagnetic (HLEM) profiling method is well suited to the problem of investigating fracture zones in crystalline rocks but there are still limitations in the way that experimental data are currently interpreted-the use of 1-D data inversion leads to inaccurate determination of geological structure. To allow accurate characterization of zones of fractured rock especially underneath heterogeneous overburden, we have developed an efficient 2.5-D regularized inversion method for reconstructing subsurface electrical resistivity distributions from multifrequency HLEM data, with the forward problem solved in 3-D using a staggered-grid finite-difference method. The inversion method is validated using a synthetic example and practical data sets from four borehole sites in a granitic terrain in northeast Brazil. An appraisal of our results for sites with boreholes sited using conventional data analysis procedures shows that we can distinguish between optimally located productive wells in fracture-zone lineaments and those with diminished yields in weathered layer with no major underlying fracture zones. We suggest that 2.5-D inversion can aid in developing better strategies for sustainable groundwater resource development in the basement terrains.

AB This paper explores adolescent preferences for the setting, timing, delivery format, provider and key elements of tobacco control programmes. The need for programme sensitivity towards urban/rural, gender and ethnic subgroups is also discussed. Schools were purposively selected from the Southern Cape-Karoo Region, South Africa. Twelve prevention and nine cessation focus group discussions were conducted with Grade 6-8 students and Grade 8-9 smokers and ex-smokers, respectively. Adolescents reported similar preferences for prevention and cessation programmes. Although they were unaware of smoking prevention or cessation programmes, they reported a willingness to participate in such programmes. Programmes should include school-based activities that are supported by out-of-school activities held over weekends and holidays. Non-judgemental and empathetic teachers and peers, as well as ex-smokers were preferred as programme providers. School-based participatory delivery formats should be supported by community-based mass media approaches. Programmes can be jointly presented to boys and girls of diverse ethnic backgrounds with some gender-sensitive sessions. Programme participation and sustainability would be enhanced if it were exciting, fun filled and integrated into their daily lives. School-based programmes must be embedded within comprehensive approaches that involve community- and policy-level interventions.

AB A baseline survey to audit the PHC operations and determine community perception and expectations of PHC service delivery was conducted in 72 communities in Enugu state, southeastern Nigeria. The study was intended to facilitate the development of intermediate performance indicators for monitoring the progress of an ongoing health sector reform and to gather baseline data for planning and policy formulation.
   The tools used for the operations audit assessed indicators for evaluating: (a) Stewardship, (b) Service Provision and (c) Administrative and financial management; while the community survey was assessed by, (a) utilization of health services, (b) perception of service delivery and (c) health care financing. One hundred and sixteen respondents from each of the facilities in the sample frame were interviewed using a structured self-assessment questionnaire and a qualitative assessment was undertaken in 53 of the facilities using an audit guide. Focus group discussions (FGD) were conducted with the policy makers and planners in each of the 17 LGAs in the state. A total of 832 respondents were interviewed in the communities (using a structured questionnaire) and 42 community FGDs were conducted.
   The results indicate a lack of operational efficiency in the majority of the facilities audited. It was also observed that majority of the facilities do not provide all services required of it, are poorly maintained, do not have enough skilled health workers and operate without a budget. There appears to be no formal financial management system in place and no policy on financial resource generation. The community survey identified two major problems; low utilization of PHCs and poor service provision. The key indicator identified by the community for evaluating performance of the PHCs remains "access to essential drugs". The major prospect was the willingness of an appreciable number of respondents to invest in health financing through insurance schemes and payment of health tax among others.
   It was evident that poor funding, bad management practices and infrastructural decay is the bane of efficient PHC delivery. Consequently, we propose that cost determination studies, to establish the financial implication of the minimum package for provision of primary healthcare services, should be an essential prerequisite to the reform process. Some critical cross-cutting issues identified from the data obtained which could form the basis for major policy thrust include, development of strategies for sustainable promotion of public-private-partnership for enhanced community involvement in healthcare management, ensuring that interventional investment is proportional to the felt health needs of the populace and funding of healthcare through equitable integration of user fees/charges.

TI Financial sustainability planning for immunization services in Cambodia
SO HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING
LA English
DT Article
DE immunization; EPI; Cambodia; financial sustainability
AB The expanded programme of immunization was established in Cambodia in 1986. In 2002, 67% of eligible children were immunized, despite significant health sector and macro-economic financial constraints. A financial sustainability planning process for immunization was introduced in 2002, in order to mobilize national and international resources in support of the achievement of child health objectives. The aim of this paper is to outline this process, describe its early impact as an advocacy tool and recommend additional strategies for mobilizing additional resources for health. The methods of financial sustainability planning are described, including the advocacy strategies that were applied. Analysis of financial sustainability planning results indicates rising programme costs associated with new vaccine introduction and new technologies. Despite this, the national programme has demonstrated important early successes in using financial sustainability planning to advocate for increased mobilization of national and international sources of funding for immunization. The national immunization programme nevertheless faces formidable system and financial challenges in the coming years associated with rising costs, potentially diminishing sources of international assistance, and the developing role of sub-national authorities in programme management and financing.

AB Correlations between process parameters and VOC emissions from an oriented strand board (OSB) made of Scots pine ( Pinus sylvestris L.) were demonstrated. Terpene and aldehyde emissions were affected by the pressing time factors in different ways: terpene emissions were lowered with elevated pressing times, whereas the formation of volatile aldehydes was accelerated. Drying temperature mainly affected the dynamics of aldehyde formation, with a clear rise and fall in aldehyde concentration after drying at elevated temperatures (170 degrees C and > 200 degrees C). As a consequence of lower temperatures (120 degrees C), aldehyde emissions from OSB constantly increased over the testing period. In spite of this context, a sustainable reduction in aldehyde emissions by adjusting the relevant process parameters does not seem to be feasible, as the concentrations released from all panels converged during emission testing.

AB There is an increasing demand for education in organic and sustainable agriculture from undergraduates, graduate students and extension agents. In this paper, we discuss highlights and evaluations of a multilevel approach to education currently being developed at North Carolina State University (NCSU) at integrates interdisciplinary training in organic and sustainable agriculture and the related discipline of agroecology through a variety of programs for undergraduate students, graduate students, and extension agents. These educational programs are possible because of a committed interdisciplinary faculty team and the Center for Environmental Farming Systems, a facility dedicated to sustainable and organic agriculture research, education, and outreach. Undergraduate programs include an inquiry-based sustainable agriculture summer internship program, a sustainable agriculture apprenticeship program, and an interdisciplinary agroecology minor that includes two newly developed courses in agroecology and a web-based agroecology course. Research projects and a diversity of courses focusing on aspects of sustainable and organic agriculture are available at NCSU for graduate students and a PhD sustainable agriculture minor is under development. A series of workshops on organic systems training offered as a graduate-level course at NCSU for extension agents is also described. Connecting experiential training to a strong interdisciplinary academic curriculum in organic and sustainable agriculture was a primary objective and a common element across all programs. We believe the NCSU educational approach and programs described here may offer insights for other land grant universities considering developing multilevel sustainable agriculture educational programs.

AB In the mid-1970s, University of California, Davis, students concerned about the environmental and social consequences of modern agriculture were interested in exploring the practice and theory of "alternative" agriculture. These students organized to create new educational opportunities to address needs that were not being met by the existing curricula. These student-initiated opportunities emphasized interdisciplinary analyses of agriculture and field-based experiential learning; they included student-organized courses and the development of the Student Experimental Farm (SEF) as a site for student education, research, demonstration, and extension projects. Over the next three decades, the SEF developed diverse experiential educational projects, classroom and field-based courses focusing on sustainable and organic agriculture, and several departments and programs offered additional, related courses and curricula. In 2004, an interdisciplinary curriculum committee within the College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences began to develop an undergraduate major in sustainable agriculture. A team of faculty and students within the committee conducted a broad stakeholder survey of agricultural practitioners, academics, students, and alumni to help inform decisions regarding what content, skills, and experiences to include in the curriculum. The survey findings reinforced the original curricular and pedagogical themes articulated and acted upon by students 30 years prior. The proposed curriculum is aimed at integrating disciplinary and interdisciplinary coursework in natural and social sciences, significant on- and off-campus experiential learning, and an emphasis on professional and interpersonal problem-solving and communication skills. Educational theory supports these diverse educational approaches and is useful in helping design courses and curricula in organic and sustainable agriculture.

AB With funding to increase support for organic farming research at land grant universities, organic growers have collaborated with faculty and administrators to develop an undergraduate, interdisciplinary minor at the University of Florida. Required introductory courses focus on general concepts of organic and sustainable farming, alternative cropping systems, production programs, handling, and marketing issues. An advanced horticulture course requires intensive examination of certification procedures, farm plans, soil fertility, and crop management, all of which are integrated into a required field project. Extension faculty have also fostered development of this new curriculum by coordinating regional workshops and field days in collaboration with organic growers and by developing educational materials on organic certification and related issues.

AB Organic agriculture has expanded to a $13 billion industry in the United States in 2005, continuing the nearly decade-long trend of 20% annual growth. Despite the growth in organic agriculture, our scientific knowledge of organic agriculture farming systems remains limited. Interest in sustainable and organic education at the university level has increased in recent years. To help address this need, the Iowa State University Graduate Program in Sustainable Agriculture (GPSA) was established in 2001 to meet three principal objectives: 1) provide students with the analytical and problem-solving skills required to meet the challenges confronting agriculture in the 21st century; 2) develop an innovative interdisciplinary and interdepartmental approach to graduate education; and 3) position Iowa State University at the forefront of institutions conducting research and extending knowledge about sustainable agricultural systems. As of 2004, more than 70 faculty from various departments and 29 students have participated in the program. Students have the opportunity to investigate organic issues within the context of the five new GPSA courses and to conduct organic agriculture farming systems research in thesis and dissertation studies. Producers and agricultural professionals are involved with GPSA students through the curriculum and on-farm research. Research questions involving optimizing crop or livestock production, plant protection, soil quality, and socioeconomic benefits of farming systems constitute typical theses.

AB This study was undertaken to evaluate natural mulches for weed control in organic onion (Allium cepa) production where current practices rely on hand-weeding or plastic mulch. Three experiments were conducted over 2 years, with two experiments conducted on-farm in different years and one experiment conducted on-station. Treatments consisted of hand-weeding or mulches of wheat (Triticum acstivum) or oat (Avena sativa) straw, bermudagrass hay (Cynodon dactylon), compost, and needles of slash pine (Pinus elliottii) and longleaf pine (P. palustris). All of the mulches with the exception of compost tended to lodge in the onion tops due to their close spacing. Wheat straw and bermudagrass hay reduced plant stand and yield. Compost settled well around the onion plants and initially smothered weeds, but over time the compost treatment became very weedy. Pine needle mulch (referred to as pine straw in the southeastern U.S.) showed the most promise with less stand loss or yield reduction, but did tend to lodge in the tops. None of these mulches were acceptable compared to hand-weeding.

AB Prof. Dr. Pieter Hendrik (Piet) Nienhuis worked for almost 40 years in all aspects of aquatic ecology and environmental science and retired on 31 October 2003. He can be characterised as a distinguished scientist, shaped in an applied estuarine and aquatic research ambience of the former Delta Institute for Hydrobiological Research (DIHO) in Yerseke in the Netherlands. His appointment as a full professor at the Radboud University Nijmegen offered him a challenging step from monodisciplinarity in ecology, via multidisciplinarity in the application of ecological knowledge in river science to interdisciplinarity in environmental science and management. This paper describes his education, teaching activities, research, scientific publications, science management, and significance for various scientific disciplines. He made important contributions to biosystematics of angiosperms and algae, the ecology of seagrasses, nutrient cycling and eutrophication in estuarine ecosystems, and the integrated modelling of the ecological functioning of estuaries. Subsequently, he paid much attention to environmental problems in river basins, ecological rehabilitation and sustainable development. His work influenced the view of ecologists, aquatic scientists and water managers in the Netherlands as well as abroad, in particular regarding the drawbacks of compartmentalization of the estuaries and the importance of connectivity and morphodynamics in river systems. In hindsight, it appears as a logical line that he gradually moved from estuarine ecological research that became increasingly driven by societal and environmental problems to the field of environmental science and management.

AB The European policy for river management during peak discharge periods is currently changing from exclusion strategies (reinforcement of dykes) to allowing a more natural situation by creating more floodplain space to reduce water levels during peak discharges. In addition, water retention and water storage areas have been created. The new measures are generally being combined with nature development strategies. Up till now, however, ecological targets of broadscale floodplain wetland restoration including sedge marshes, species-rich floodplain forests and carrs, riparian mesotrophic grasslands and other biodiverse riverine ecosystems, have hardly developed in these areas. Most studies on the conditions needed for sustainable ecological development of floodplains have focused on hydrological and geomorphological rather than biogeochemical issues (including nutrient availability and limitation). There are, however, large differences in the composition of river water and groundwater and in sediment quality between rivers in densely populated areas and those in more pristine areas, which serve as a reference. It is very likely that these factors, in combination with heavily altered hydrological regimes and the narrow areas confined between the dykes on both sides of the rivers, impose major constraints on sustainable ecological development of riverine areas. Another issue is that existing wetlands are generally considered to be very appropriate for water retention and conservation, although recent research has shown that this may pose a serious threat to their biodiversity. The present paper reviews the biogeochemical constraints on the combination of floodplain rehabilitation, water conservation and the conservation and development of wetlands. It is concluded that biogeochemical problems (mainly related to eutrophication) predominantly arise in less dynamic parts of the river system, to which the flood-pulse concept applies less. Sound knowledge of the biogeochemical processes involved will contribute to greater efficiency and a better prediction of the opportunities for restoration and development of riverine wetlands. This information can be directly applied in nature management, water management, policy-making and consultancy.

AB Over the past 50 years ecology has developed into a mature branch of the natural sciences, comprising firm concepts (e.g. for rivers River Continuum Concept and Flood Pulse Concept) and extensive empirical surveys (sophisticated lab and field experiments, simulation models, GIS). Estuaries and rivers are continuously threatened ecosystems, considering the massive expansion of man's economic activities. I focus on rivers and estuaries in the Netherlands (W. Europe), where recent public interest has mainly been determined by two flooding disasters (mega-disaster in 1953; near-disaster in 1995). The measures taken to enhance the safety of the human population were adequate: building of large closure dams, and storm surge barriers in the estuaries, and heightening of levees along the rivers. Eventually these measures were detrimental for what was left of the dynamic river ecosystems from the past. This paper focuses on two ecosystem studies. (1) An ecosystem study in Grevelingen lagoon, a large embanked estuary that changed into a brackish water lagoon. Predictive ecological models (e.g. for the wax and wane of Eelgrass, Zostera marina) were inadequate because of the exceptional characteristics of the lagoon: the ecosystem appeared to be instable, and not resilient. (2) An ecosystem study at Afferdensche and Deestsche Waarden, a floodplain area along the river Waal, strongly affected by toxicants deposited before 1980. We studied the functioning and eco-toxicology of floodplain food webs, deteriorated by pollutants. Fine-tuned spatial components were introduced in ecological risk assessment models of several trophic levels (e.g. a top predator, the Little Owl, Athena noctua). Safety for the human population, living below sea level, and below the level of the main rivers, must be improved, but overhasty technocratic measures deteriorating the remaining semi-natural, highly appreciated landscapes, should be avoided. Stakeholder interests must be adapted to sustainable ecological river management, and not the other way round, as has been done for the past ten centuries.

AB Despite the major advances in science to underpin water resources and river management that have taken place over the past two decades, a need remains to establish a unifying framework that will lead to new, appropriate tools for water resources management. In Europe, this need has been highlighted by the promotion of the Water Framework Directive. From a scientific perspective, key questions focus on the ecological significance of flow variability over a range of timescales and the linkage between flow variability, habitat variability and biological population responses, and the biological interactions among these populations. Creation of scientifically sound tools requires development of knowledge at the level of first principles to realize sustainable developments within the context of adaptive management. Similitude analyses provide a mechanism for upscaling from fine 'research' scales to the coarser scales of water resource managers. Lack of appropriate data is the major obstacle to the development of these tools, especially those concerned with large rivers.

AB This paper critically reviews developments in the conceptualization and elaboration of the River Ecosystem Health (REH) concept. Analysis of literature shows there is still no consistent meaning of the central concept Ecosystem Health, resulting in models (i.e. elaborations) that have unclear and insufficient conceptual grounds. Furthermore, a diverse terminology is associated with describing REH, resulting in confusion with other concepts. However, if the concept is to have merit and longevity in the field of river research and management, unambiguous definition of the conceptual meaning and operational domain are required. Therefore a redefinition is proposed, based on identified characteristics of health and derived from considering semantic and conceptual definitions. Based on this definition, REH has merit in a broader context of river system health that considers societal functioning next to ecological functioning. Assessment of health needs integration of measures of multiple, complementary attributes and analysis in a synthesized way. An assessment framework is proposed that assesses REH top-down as well as bottom up by combining indicators of system stress responses (i.e. condition) with indicators identifying the causative stress (i.e. stressor). The scope of REH is covered by using indicators of system activity, metabolism (vigour), resilience, structure and interactions between system components (organization). The variety of stress effects that the system may endure are covered by using biotic, chemical as well as physical stressors. Besides having a unique meaning, the REH metaphor has added value to river management by being able to mobilize scientists, practitioners and publics and seeing relationships at the level of values. It places humans at the centre of the river ecosystem, while seeking to ensure the durability of the ecosystem of which they are an integral part. Optimization of the indicator set, development of aggregation and classification methodologies, and implementation of the concept within differing international frames are considered main aims for future research.

AB Because of climate change and the need for sustainable water systems, water management has changed considerably in recent years, from river management to basin management. This change is illustrated for both the main Dutch river system and a small, representative regional water system in the Netherlands. This change results in four major challenges, (1) creating an effective regional administration which functions as a network authority, (2) increasing collaboration with other water managers, (3) increasing efficiency and achieving goals at minimum cost, and (4) communicating in an open manner with stakeholders. The article outlines the way in which water managers try to address these challenges. Special attention is given to the need for increased coordination between environmental policies and water policies.

AB This paper discusses and summarizes the major conclusions of the special issue entitled 'Living rivers: trends and challenges in science and management' of Hydrobiologia/Developments in Hydrobiology. It is structured along three lines: (1) Functioning of river systems; (2) Ecological rehabilitation of river systems; (3) Challenges and obstacles to sustainable management. Sustainable river basin management requires a thorough understanding of natural, physical, chemical and ecological processes as well as socio-economic functioning. Environmental rehabilitation of river systems inevitably requires an ecosystem-based approach involving solutions supported by the public. The challenge is to combine ecological and socio-economic sustainability. Rethinking our efforts in both directions must lead to more innovative solutions than those available at present.

AB Currently, many problems beset sustainable management of Caspian sturgeon stocks, some outside the traditional theory of fishery management. Successfully solving such problems requires different models of population dynamics, reflecting the phenomenological properties of sturgeon stocks, the consequences of their overexploitation, and issues relating to environmental pressure on the ecosystem in which they live. Of the many analytical tools available to address the various questions, problem-orientated models are few. Their development demands a new approach, a new modelling paradigm, and new modelling tools that meet the modem ideas of ecosystem analysis and cognitive theory. This paper offers one such new paradigm and describes a knowledge-based modelling technique that may provide realization of this paradigm. A problem-orientated version of knowledge-based models is described, the applicability of such models in attempting to solve the practical issues of sturgeon fisheries management is reviewed, and an example of model implementation is given.

AB We studied the genetic stock structure of Scomberomorus commerson (locally called kingfish) using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and direct sequencing analyses of mtDNA samples from seven locations within the ROPME sea area (Arabian Gulf, Gulf of Oman, and Arabian Sea). A 475-bp segment from the D-loop region was screened in 218 samples using six restriction enzymes, resulting in 22 composite haplotypes. Mean nucleotide diversity for the seven populations was 0.025 (+/- 0.000). An AMOVA comparison among groups of individuals inside and outside the Gulf showed 0.49% variation (p = 0.201), whereas the variation of populations within these groups was 0.05% (p = 0.408). The mean F(ST) value for population pairwise comparisons was 0.010. To further resolve genealogies, sequence analysis was performed on a 330-bp fragment from the same segment for 193 fish. The genetic variance estimated across all populations was similar to the RFLP data, indicating a homogeneous distribution consistent with a single intermingling genetic stock. Based on the genetic marker tested, the null hypothesis that kingfish within the ROPME sea area constitutes a single stock cannot be rejected, but considering that a few migrating fish can reduce heterogeneity to where genetic drift is undetectable, panmixia cannot be confirmed. The results cautiously suggest that adopting a single-stock model and regional shared management are appropriate for sustainable long-term use of this important resource. More rigorous genetic testing using additional neutral markers, and mark-recapture experiments to detect spatial movement patterns, are recommended to further elucidate any stock substructure.

AB Sustainable management of tropical forests has been identified as one of the main objectives for global conservation and management of carbon stocks. Toward this goal, managers need tools to determine whether current management practices are sustainable. Several international initiatives have been undertaken for the development of criteria and indicators to aid managers in moving toward sustainable practices. Despite these efforts, the question of how to apply and assess indicators remains to be answered from an operational, field-based perspective. Field surveys are expensive and time-consuming when management areas are large and in the face of logistical constraints. Thus, there is a need for an approach to prioritization. We sought to determine whether satellite imagery can be used, in conjunction with standard forest management data, to identify and rank priority areas for field surveys of bioindicators. The study area in Costa Rica, in forest areas managed by the Fundacion para el Desarrollo de la Cordillera Volcanica Central (FUNDECOR), was imaged by the Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper in 1986 and 2001. Through spatial statistical analysis applied to the wide dynamic range vegetation index, we were able to quantify and rank changes in canopy spatial structure. The resulting categories can be used by forest managers to identify which areas are in need of field surveys. More generally, we show how to generate a moving baseline for change analysis and evaluate for significant deviations in spatial structure.

TI Economical analysis of rainbow trout stocked with two different density

SO INDIAN VETERINARY JOURNAL

DT Article
ID ONCORHYNCHUS-MYKISS
AB Majority of the studies on rainbow trout in Turkey are related to biology, physiology, pathology and genetics of cultured fish, nutrition, feeding and stocking practices, conversion efficiency and growth rates of cultured species but the number of studies covering development of economically sound and sustainable production techniques is very limited. Therefore, the main objective of this study is to analyse the production of rainbow trout in two different stocking density cages from economical point of view.

AB Drawing on resource-based theory and insights from qualitative fieldwork we examine resource drivers of export venture performance in industrial firms using primary data from German and UK industrial-goods manufacturers. Our results indicate that while the levels of individual export venture resources are not directly related to export venture performance in the firms in our sample, many of the resources are related to two important characteristics of resources - namely the inimitability and non-substitutability of the mix of resources available to the export venture. Furthermore, we find that that resource inimitability and non-substitutability are directly related to export venture performance. Taken together these results demonstrate the important role that inimitability and non-substitutability play in mediating the resource-to-performance relationship in the industrial goods export ventures in our sample. Our study provides some of the first direct evidence supporting a key premise of the resource-based view of the firm - that the competitive imitability of a firm's resources and the inability of rivals to use substitute resources to execute a similar strategy are important drivers of firm performance.

AB In this study, we examine two very different firms operating in the Brazilian real-time financial information services (RTFIS) industry. We conducted two separate qualitative studies 7 years apart analyzing how a technology-based incumbent reacted to the entry of a challenger with better content-generation capabilities. We concluded that even when facing an entrant with new technologies and environmental changes, commitment to its own IS resources represented the best long-term strategy for the incumbent firm, because the incumbent kept focused on what it did best and invested in the redeployment of its flexible IS resources to redefine its industry processes and activities.

TI The future of United Kingdom nuclear weapons: shaping the debate
SO INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
LA English
DT Article
AB Britain has been a nuclear-weapon state since the 1950s, mostly in extensive cooperation with the United States in equipment procurement, though (contrary to the aims of anti-nuclear campaigners) full freedom of operational action has been kept. The current force of four nuclear-powered submarines armed with Trident D.5 missiles is not expected to be dependably sustainable beyond the early or middle 2020s in key respects, and lead times mean that initial decisions on whether and if so how to maintain capability thereafter need to be taken by about 2010. The open debate for which the government has called will have to consider international obligations and likely repercussions, strategic and ethical arguments, options for renewal (including at reduced scale), the amount and incidence of costs, and opportunity costs. The government has not yet published enough information to underpin firm conclusions about continuance other than for 'true believers' either pro or con.

TI Vaccination against filarial nematodes with irradiated larvae provides
   long-term protection against the third larval stage but not against
   subsequent life cycle stages

AB Sustainable control of human filariasis would benefit enormously from the development of an effective vaccine. The ability to vaccinate experimental animals, with reductions in worm burden of over 70%, suggests this aim is possible. However, in experimental vaccinations the challenge is usually administered 2 weeks after the immunisation phase and thus the protection obtained is likely to be biased by persisting inflammation. Using the murine model Litomosoides sigmodontis, we increased the time between immunisation with irradiated larvae and challenge with fully infective L3 to 5 months. Significant protection was achieved (54-58%) and the reduced worm burden was observed by 10 days p.i. The developmental stage targeted was the L3, since no nematodes died once they reached the pleural cavity of vaccinated mice, as has been previously shown in short-term protocols. However, larval developmental rate was faster in vaccinated than in primary-infected mice. Immunological assessments were made prior to challenge and then from 6 h to 34 days post-challenge. Samples were taken from the subcutaneous tissue where the larvae were inoculated, the lymph nodes through which they migrate and the pleural cavity in which they establish. Eosinophils were still present although scarce in the subcutaneous tissue of vaccinated mice before challenge. Cytokine and specific antibody production of vaccinated and challenged mice were L3-specific and Th2-biased and greatly exceeded the response of primary-infected mice. The heightened Th2 response may explain the faster development of the filarial worms in vaccinated mice. Thus, long-term vaccination protocols generated a strong memory response that led to significant but incomplete protection that was limited to the infective larval stage suggesting alternative vaccination strategies are needed.

   analysis
AB New and continuing environmental demands and competitive forces require healthcare organizations to be increasingly careful in thinking about their strategies. They must do so in a highly unusual (multi-actor) marketplace where a variety of system interdependencies complicate decision-making. A good strategy requires an attempt to understand the real, as distinct from the perceived, environment, and is characterized by explicit tradeoffs along three dimensions: service or program variety, patient needs, and patient access. The quality of these tradeoffs can be assessed in terms of whether the strategy is (a) attuned to critical success factors in the organization's environment, (b) highly focused, (c) linked to the organization's capabilities, and (d) accompanied by an activity set that is difficult for competitors to imitate. An organization also must be capable of adapting appropriately to changes in its environment. Thus, even the best strategy must be reviewed constantly if it is to remain viable. A strategy's sustainability can be adversely affected by increased buyer or supplier power, lowered barriers to entry, growing rivalry, the threat of substitutes, and increased slack in resource usage. By thinking more creatively in the future than they have in the past, healthcare organizations can make tradeoffs and choose a focused strategic position. They then can design an activity set that is appropriate for that position, and that will assist them to achieve both financial viability and superior programmatic performance. A well-designed activity set also will assist them to sustain their performance in the face of changing environmental demands and competitive forces. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

DE supply function competition; collusion; repeated games
ID ELECTRICITY; MARKET
AB The paper makes two contributions to the theory of repeated oligopoly games. First, we build a supergame model where firms compete in supply functions. We show how collusion sustainability is affected by the presence of a convex cost function, the slope of market demand, and the number of rivals. Second, we compare the results with those of standard quantity competition under the same market structure. It is found that depending on the number of rivals and the slope of the market demand, collusion is easier to sustain under supply function rather than under quantity competition.

TI Life cycle assessment of the mobile communication system UMTS - Towards

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT

   communication); mobile phone; UNITS (Universal mobile telecommunication
   system)
AB Goal, Scope and Background. Goal of this study is an evaluation of the environmental sustainability of the UMTS mobile communication system in Switzerland by means of a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). A baseline environmental impact profile across the full life cycle of the UNITS (Universal Mobile Telecommunication System) and its predecessor, the GSM (Global System for Mobile Communication) is presented. The baseline assessment was a necessary first step to evaluate the environmental impacts of the mobile communication systems use and growth, thus permitting the evaluation of its environmental sustainability.
   Main Features. Two functional units are defined: a data set of 1 Gbit (1.000.000 kbit), and the yearly mobile communication of an average customer. In the UNITS, both data packages and calls can be conveyed. In order to be able to standardize the results, an equivalence between these two kinds of transmission is formed. Two different options are defined, which represent different ways of transferring the data: mobile phone to mobile phone, and mobile phone to fixed network. All components of the UMTS network like the mobile phones, base stations, antennae, switching systems and the components of the landline like cable system and switching centers, are assessed. The environmental impacts are assessed taking into account all major life cycle phases like raw material extraction, manufacturing, use, disassembly and disposal of the product and the needed infrastructure. Electronic components like printed wiring boards and integrated circuits are assessed using a simple model based on the size (for IQ or number of layers (for PWB), respectively. Mining of precious metals (gold, silver) is included.
   The study was carried out by ESU-services, Motorola, Swisscom and Deutsche Telekom. Thanks to the industrial partners it can rely on primary data for the production of mobile phone and base station, and for the operation of the networks. As the UNITS network is still being built, no actual data of network operation is available. Data from the GSM (Global System for Mobile Communication) were used in case of data gaps.
   Results and Conclusions. About 25 kg CO2 are emitted and 800 MJ-eq (non-renewable) primary energy are required for the transfer of 1 Gbit information from mobile phone to mobile phone in the UNITS network. For a transfer from mobile to fixed network, these values are 20 kg CO2 and 640 MJ-eq, respectively. On the other hand, the fixed network requires more resources like copper (0.07 kg for the mobile to mobile option vs. 0.12 kg for mobile to fixed network).
   From an environmental point of view, the mobile telephone is the most important element of the mobile communication network (UMTS and GSM). The short service life of the mobile phone plays a substantial role. Increasing the utilization period of the mobile phone (e.g. by leasing, re-use, extension of the innovation cycles, etc.) could thus represent a large potential for its improvement. The second most important components are the base stations. In the assessment mainly the use phase proved to be important. The lower environmental impact (per Gbit data transfer) as compared to the mobile phone can be explained by the longer service life (around factor 8). Main impacts are caused by the electricity consumption, in particular the energy needed for cooling the base stations. By choosing an environmentally benign electricity mix and/or by increasing the portion of renewable sources of energy, the network operators have a substantial potential of lower the environmental impacts (in particular the greenhouse gas emissions) of mobile telecommunication. Furthermore, the manufacturing of electronic components, the life time of the appliances and energy consumption are key parameters influencing the environmental profile of the networks most.
   Given its larger data transfer rate, the UNITS is ecologically more favorable in terms of data transfer rate than its predecessor, the GSM system. The higher energy consumption and the more complex production of the devices in the UNITS system are compensated by the faster data transmission rate. Per customer, the result is inverse, however, since the higher efficiency is compensated by the higher data communication per user in the UNITS system. The UMTS network in its state of 2004 according to the 2001 planning and with the accordingly calculated number of customers and data transfer causes 2.1 times more CO2 emissions and requires 2.4 times more (non-renewable) primary energy per customer than for the GSM system in its current state. It must be noted, however, that the UNITS technology supports other services than the GSM system. The development of the UNITS is accompanied with an increased consumption of resources and emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases regarding the entire system for mobile telephone communication.
   The GSM system is a mature technology, while the UNITS is still at the beginning of its learning curve. Thus, it can be safely assumed that large improvement potentials are still present for the UMTS network components concerning expenditures and emissions both at production and by the use of the devices. This study provides the necessary information where such improvements are most effective in environmental terms.

AB Several studies have tried to find countermeasures against musculoskeletal de-conditioning during bed-rest, but none of them yielded decisive results. We hypothesised that resistive vibration exercise (RVE) might be a suitable training modality. We have therefore carried out a bed-rest study to evaluate its feasibility and efficacy during 56 days of bed-rest. Twenty healthy male volunteers aged 24 to 43 years were recruited and, after medical check-ups, randomised to a non-exercising control (Ctrl) group or a group that performed RVE 11 times per week. Strict bed-rest was controlled by video surveillance. The diet was controlled. RVE was performed in supine position, with a static force component of about twice the body weight and a smaller dynamic force component. RVE comprised four different units (squats, heel raises, toe raises, kicks), each of which lasted 60 - 100 seconds. Pre and post exercise levels of lactate were measured once weekly. Body weight was measured daily on a bed scale. Pain questionnaires were obtained in regular intervals during and after the bed-rest. Vibration frequency was set to 19 Hz at the beginning and progressed to 25.9 Hz (SD 1.9) at the end of the study, suggesting that the dynamic force component increased by 90%. The maximum sustainable exercise time for squat exercise increased from 86 s (SD 21) on day 11 of the BR to 176 s (SD 73) on day 53 (p = 0.006). On the same days, post-exercise lactate levels increased from 6.9 mmol/l (SD2.3) to 9.2 mmol/l (SD 3.5, p = 0.01). On average, body weight was unchanged in both groups during bed-rest, but single individuals in both groups depicted significant weight changes ranging from -10% to + d10% (p < 0.001). Lower limb pain was more frequent during bed-rest in the RVE subjects than in Ctrl (p = 0.035). During early recovery, subjects of both groups suffered from muscle pain to a comparable extent, but foot pain was more common in Ctrl than in RVE (p = 0.013 for plantar pain, p = 0.074 for dorsal foot pain). Our results indicate that RVE is feasible twice daily during bed-rest in young healthy males, provided that one afternoon and one entire day per week are free. Exercise progression, mainly by progression of vibration frequency, yielded increases in maximum sustainable exercise time and blood lactate. In conclusion, RVE as performed in this study, appears to be safe.

AB Motexafin gadolinium (Xcytrin (R)) is an expanded porphyrin macrocyclic compound under development for the treatment of several types of cancer. Currently clinical trials and non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology studies are ongoing. The goals of this open label, four arm, non-crossover bioavailability study were to explore motexafin gadolinium pharmacokinetics, determine the IP bioavailability, and define a pharmacokinetic model suitable for descriptive and predictive use. Mice received one or seven daily IV or IP injections (40 mg/kg) then blood samples were collected and analyzed. Plasma concentration data were modelled using population pharmacokinetic methods and a two compartment model was the most appropriate model. The stability and predictive performance of the model were evaluated using bootstrap procedures. The accuracy of the predicted concentrations was 8.3%. Motexafin gadolinium was rapidly cleared from the plasma and although T-1/2 beta was 12.9 h there was no accumulation following seven doses. The IP bioavailability was 87.4% and higher plasma concentrations were sustainable for a longer period with IP dosing. V-c was larger than the blood volume and the tissue compartment volume was 38% of V-c, suggesting motexafin gadolinium was not widely distributed into less well perfused tissues. The pharmacokinetic profile in this study was similar to that in oncology patients administered multiple doses of motexafin gadolinium. The unbiased model yields reliable parameter estimates and insight into the pharmacokinetics of motexafin gadolinium in mice, is suitable for both descriptive and predictive purposes, and is a valuable tool in the planning, analysis, and interpretation of pharmacology and toxicology studies in mice.

AB It is common to define drainage as a means to enhance crop production and increase productivity. In order to meet this objective, drainage systems are designed and managed to maintain favourable moisture and salt conditions in the root zone. Examples from around the world show that drainage has done well to achieve this objective. However, lessons show that many impacts of drainage, positive and negative, have been overlooked, including those on health, built-up settlements and infrastructure, flood management, groundwater recharge, sanitation, surface and groundwater quality, fisheries and aquatic life, and the environment in general. Thus, the single-objective approach takes drainage out of the broader context of land and water management and diminishes the overall gains of improved drainage and ignores its full cost. It does also not allow the stakeholders from outside the farming community to be involved in the decision-making leading to conflict of interests. It also misses an important opportunity for increasing the financing potential.
   A better understanding of drainage as a practice for managing the multiple functions of land and water resources is needed in order to achieve an optimal mix of economic and social gains, sustainable natural resources management and a healthy environment. This would only be possible when an interdisciplinary and integrated approach is followed in planning and managing land drainage. The approach, called DRAINFRAME, is a framework for analysis, communication, discussion, and decision-making by all stakeholders. It looks at the overall social, economic, and environmental productivity of the entire water management system, of which drainage is an integral part. It allows comprehensive analysis and assessment of basin-wide social and economic impacts of drainage following a participatory planning approach. Although the methodology was developed from a drainage perspective, it is geared towards natural resources management planning in general. It can be equally used in planning irrigation, flood control or watershed management projects. The DRAINFRAME approach was applied in planning some new World Bank-supported projects in Egypt and Pakistan with the objective of promoting the concept of integrated water resources management.

DE irrigation; water-saving; institutional development; strategy
AB Per capita freshwater availability in China is among the lowest in the world and increasingly in short supply. Less water will be available for irrigation, which consumes the largest amount of fresh water because of the rapidly increased demands for fresh water for industrial and domestic use. To feed the increasing population under the conditions of keeping sound ecosystems and environment, there is an urgent need for China to produce more food with less water than for many other countries in the world. In recent decades China has pioneered some water saving policies and water saving irrigation (WSI) techniques, aimed at increasing water and land productivity. Policies for WSI from high level support conducive institutional development, leading to maximization of the effects of agricultural infrastructure, and of successful research on, and dissemination of, new technologies. There are many success stories about "real" water savings in China. This paper introduces the development of the WSI techniques and the impacts of WSI on society, the economy and the environment, and presents the experiences and lessons on WSI from China. Based on the analysis on the supply and demand of fresh water, the objectives and tasks for water saving from irrigated agriculture in China are discussed, and the strategies for sustainable water use and agricultural development and the main measures leading to increasing water and land productivity are mentioned.

AB Water has unique features, which distinguish it from other natural resources. These characteristics usually result in legal systems in which water belongs to the public domain, but rights granted to economic agents to use it are protected under constitutional guarantee of private property. The allocation and retention of water rights are always contingent upon putting them to a socially recognized beneficial use. For an increasingly scarce resource, new demands can only be satisfied by transferring water rights from existing uses. To deal with the problem of reallocation, countries have to decide whether to use administrative mechanisms or water markets. For the sustainable and efficient functioning of water markets, it is necessary to have an institutional and legal system that is compatible with water marketing as well as with the nature of the water resource itself. A water market without regulations to protect the resource base, third parties and the environment, and to prevent monopolization, will result in uncontrolled private appropriation of a scarce resource and problems in related markets rather than in efficient resource allocation.

AB The effects of climate change and the growing world population are together increasing both the chance of flooding and the consequences. There is increasing recognition that reliance on structural flood defences alone may be neither sufficient nor sustainable in the longer term. The lessons of the past and our developing understanding of the mechanisms causing flooding and the range of measures available to manage the risk, need to be harnessed in a new approach to living with flood risk. In particular, residual flood risk, being that remaining after any mitigation measures have been taken, should be assessed and addressed with an appropriate response. That response must command the support of those at risk. Flood warning is one tool and an outline is provided of the Environment Agency's service. Copyright (C) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Aims. This paper reports a study describing community nurses' health promotion work with older people aged 50 years and above, and exploring particular health promotion initiatives for older people that would have transferability potential.
   Background. With the ageing of populations worldwide, community nurses in primary healthcare settings have a key contribution to make to the health improvement agenda for older people, yet little is known of the extent of this aspect of their work.
   Methods. Questionnaires were sent to 1062 community nurses in six Scottish National Health Service Boards - public health nurses/health visitors, district nurses, general practice nurses, community psychiatric and learning disability nurses and combined duty nurses; 373 (35%) responded, 30 of whom were interviewed by telephone. The data were collected in 2003-2004. Findings.
   Findings confirmed the wide scope of health promotion, much of which may be embedded and unrecognized. Creative group work showed promise in achieving heath gain for older people, and a range of partnership approaches interdisciplinary, multidisciplinary and interagency - was evident. Theoretical input and project opportunities within educational programmes had been a catalyst for health promotion initiatives in practice. However, evidence of audit, evaluation, and active involvement of older people in planning health promotion was limited. Funding of health promotion initiatives was vital to sustainability.
   Conclusion. There is merit in making the health promotion work of community nurses more visible through audit and systematic evaluation; promoting the active involvement of older people; strengthening partnership working; and further raising the profile of health in later life within undergraduate and postgraduate community nursing programmes.

AB This paper provides an account of the origins and formation of the UK Research Councils' Rural Economy and Land Use (RELU) programme and its approach to promoting interdisciplinary working between social and natural scientists. The programme is set in the context of broader developments in science policy, including a policy discourse centred upon sustainable development and the knowledge economy and associated demands for greater accountability in science. Interdisciplinarity promises research that will be more relevant and responsive to public needs and concerns. In describing the provenance of the RELU programme, therefore, the paper seeks to lay out the different stages in its initiation and design to show how, to varying degrees, these were open to external scrutiny and influence. The process of developing the programme illustrates that it is not straightforward to make research agendas and funding more transparent and accountable. It also provides insights into the challenges that interdisciplinarity and accountability present to established science institutions.

AB The landscape has long been an important object of rural policy, particularly in terms of protecting scenic areas. Increasingly, however, landscape is seen as a multifunctional and holistic entity, which provides a framework for the governance and interdisciplinary study of spatial units. A central dilemma in the maintenance of cultural landscapes is that the historical practices which produced them are often obsolete, and new social and economic forces may fail to reproduce their valued properties. Sustainable development strategies therefore seek to instil 'virtuous' circles in cultural landscapes, linking society and economy to environmental service functions and land uses, in order to generate mutually reinforcing feedback loops resulting in socially preferred outcomes. We explore ways of investigating these linkages as a basis for future rural research and policy. We conceptualise cultural landscapes as 'socio-ecological systems' (SESs), and consider their capacity for resilience and stability. Noting that resilient systems are characterised, not by simple equilibria, but by 'basins of attraction', we argue the need to understand the ways in which SESs stabilise within a particular basin, or move to an alternative. In particular, we reflect on the dynamics of 'adaptive cycles' that may lead to changes in system state. Finally, we discuss the development of appropriate models as tools for investigating whether a landscape is trending towards stability within a 'vicious' or a 'virtuous' circle, and evaluating potential interventions to alter this trajectory.

AB At a global level, increasing emphasis on sustainable development highlights the importance of maintaining and enhancing biodiversity. Within the European Union, agricultural reforms will have a considerable influence on the links between biodiversity, agriculture and rural communities over the next 10-20 years. An understanding of the associations between biodiversity and the rural economy is important for the development of policies to promote environmentally sustainable economic and social well-being. However, investigations of this type are frequently hindered by the different ways in which data in the natural and social sciences are collected. In this paper, we develop an innovative approach to combine data using a common spatial unit. We illustrate the application of this approach by examining associations between bird species richness, environmental and socio-economic variables. Our results show how the statistical relationship between biodiversity and environmental factors is strengthened and contextualised by prevailing socio-economic conditions. This example highlights the additional insights that can be gained from such an integrative approach, especially in terms of the questions it raises about the inter-relationships between the social, physical and ecological dynamics of rural environments.

ID IMPACT ASSESSMENT EIA; ZONE MANAGEMENT; PERSPECTIVES
AB Integrated coastal zone management (ICZM) is widely recognised as a key mechanism for asserting sustainable development objectives within coastal areas. However, despite significant developments in ICZM practice and developlate ment, a number of challenges remain. Particular concerns relate to the existence of a limited understanding of the relationship between biophysical and socioeconomic processes and poor mechanisms for institutional coordination. This article explores the contribution that strategic environmental assessment (SEA) can make as a decision-making tool for integration within ICZM. Through the adoption of systematic "tiered" assessment procedures, it is argued that SEA can help identify and mitigate competing development pressures.

AB Turkey is bordered on three sides by the sea and has a long coastline. Canakkale is one of the most important cities of Turkey, with its natural, cultural, and historical characteristics. With a 750-kilometer-long coastline and the Dardanelles, one of the most important waterways of the world, this part of the country has historically been an attractive area. The Kordonboyu coastal area, ca. 2 kilometers long, is the most important attraction in the city. Located east of the Dardanelles, the study area has always been a center of interest.
   The aim of this investigation was to determine the negative effects of settlement, industry, trade, or similar activities associated with a rapid increase in city population on the coastal structure of Canakkale and to provide suggestions for rearrangement studies with sustainable planning approaches.
   The study was carried out in two stages by collecting and analyzing data. In this study, the factors that affect planning in the city (natural factors, demographic structure of the population, socioeconomic structure) have been inspected. Current land uses in the Kordonboyu coastal area and environs have been analyzed. Also, to determine the inclinations of the people of Qanakkale toward current land use of the research area, a questionnaire was made. Chi square analysis showed that the relationships between age groups and other parameters were significant (p < 0.05).
   The data taken from the questionnaires show that the Qanakkale community is concerned with land use and has a desire to live in a modern and well-arranged city. For this reason, the local administrations that are in a position to make decisions on land use policy should conduct studies that will take ecological criteria into account.

AB While a large literature discusses the impact of titles on tenure security in Africa, little attention has been devoted to land conflicts. We use Ugandan data to explore the incidence of land conflicts, the impact of legal changes on their frequency, and their impact on productivity. Results indicate that female-headed households and widows are particularly affected that passage of the 1998 Land Act has failed to reduce their number, and that they have a significant and large productivity-reducing impact. In Africa, attention to land-related conflicts including ways to prevent and resolve them constitutes an important area for policy and research. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Welfare measures under threats of environmental catastrophes are studied using the "parable" apparatus of Weitzman and Lofgren [On the welfare significance of green accounting as taught by parable, J. Environ. Econ. Manage. 32 (1997) 139-153]. The occurrence probability of the catastrophic events is driven (at least partly) by anthropogenic activities such as natural resource exploitation. Without external effects, the green NNP is a genuine welfare measure vis-a-vis a particular parable economy. Often, however, the occurrence hazard constitutes a public bad, treated as an externality by agents who ignore their own contribution to its accumulation. In such cases the green NNP, although accounting for the event hazard rate per se, fails to properly internalize future effects on the hazard rate of current economic activities and as a result overestimates welfare. The bias term associated with the green NNP is derived and expressed in a simple and interpretable form. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The United States Climate Change Initiative includes improvements to the U.S. Department of Energy's Voluntary Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program. The program includes specific accounting rules and guidelines for reporting and registering forestry activities that reduce atmospheric CO2 by increasing carbon sequestration or reducing emissions. In the forestry sector, there is potential for the economic value of emissions credits to provide increased income for landowners, to support rural development, to facilitate the practice of sustainable forest management, and to support restoration of ecosystems. Forestry activities with potential for achieving substantial reductions include, but are not limited to: afforestation, mine land reclamation, forest restoration, agroforestry, forest management, short-rotation biomass energy plantations, forest protection, wood production, and urban forestry. To be eligible for registration, the reported reductions must use methods and meet standards contained in the guidelines. Forestry presents some unique challenges and opportunities because of the diversity of activities, the variety of practices that can affect greenhouse gases, year-to-year variability in emissions and sequestration, the effects of activities on different forest carbon pools, and accounting for the effects of natural disturbance.

AB Soil organic carbon (SOC) has beneficial effects on soil quality and productivity. Cropping systems that maintain and/or improve levels of SOC may lead to sustainable crop production. This study evaluated the effects of long-term cropping systems on C sequestration. Soil samples were taken at 0- to 10-, 10- to 20-, 20- to 30-, and 30- to 40-cm soil depth profiles from grass pasture (GP), conventional tillage (CT) winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-fallow (CTWF), and fertilized and unfertilized plots of continuous winter wheat (WW), spring wheat (SW), and spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) (SB) monocultures under CT and no-till (NT). The samples were analyzed for soil organic matter (SOM) and SOC was derived. Ages of experiments ranged from 6 to 73 yr. Compared to 1931 SOC levels (initial year), CTWF reduced SOC by 9 to 12 Mg ha(-1) in the 0- to 30-cm zone. Grass pasture increased SOC by 6 Mg ha-1 in the 0- to 10-cm zone but decreased SOC by 3 Mg ha-1 in the 20- to 30-cm zone. Continuous CT monocultures depleted SOC in the top 0- to 10-cm zone and the bottom 20- to 40-cm zone but maintained SOC levels close to 1931 SOC levels in the 10- to 20-cm layer. Continuous NT monocultures accumulated more SOC in the 0- to 10-cm zone than in deeper zones. Total SOC (0- to 40-cm zone) was highest under GP and continuous cropping and lowest under CTWE Fertilizer increased total SOC only under CTWW and CTSB by 13 and 7 Mg ha-1 in 13 yr, respectively. Practicing NT for only 6 yr had started to reverse the effect of 73 yr of CTWE Compared to CTWF, NTWW and NTSW sequestered C at rates of 2.6 and 1.7 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively, in the 0- to 40-cm zone. This study showed that the potential to sequester C can be enhanced by increasing cropping frequency and eliminating tillage.

AB Historical approaches to water quality control are finding new challenges as ecosystem issues are addressed in comprehensive water resources management programs. Important issues include the recognition that physical habitat conditions may be more important than water quality when ecosystem sustainability is the management objective. Although past emphasis has been on the control of continuous discharges, modern watershed management recognizes that achieving ecosystem sustainability requires control of runoff events that are variable in volume, timing, and frequency. This paper will explore how physical habitat management plays a dominant role in the determination of the ecosystem sustainability. Physical habitat is the result of an eco-hydro-geomorphic systems integration. This integration recognizes that magnitude, duration, and frequency, particularly in the hydrologic system contributes to an understanding of sensitivity and vulnerability in channel networks. Other topics of discussion include the critical linkages between contaminant concentration, duration of exposure, and frequency of recurrence in a watershed setting where differing levels of habitat stability are related to landscape use. The paper will also explore ecological engineering and associated ecohydrology and ecohydraulics in the development of modern watershed management.

AB Based on the theory of decompose-coordination for large-scale systems, a systematic optimal operation model with multi-objective programming is developed for optimal allocation of water resources in Guangzhou City, South China. The methods of hierarchical analysis and step by step toleration obligation are used in the process of coordination through the sub-systems. Through the integrated regulation of 13 reservoirs and 6 main rivers and the regional watersheds, estimated water amount for dry year (P = 97%) is distributed optimally to 14 water resource units to meet water demand in the year 2020. Water shortage due to lack of runoff and insufficient water supply projects is analyzed. The scheme of water allocation within seven water resource districts is put forward to match the sustainable balance of water supply to water demand in Guangzhou City.

AB This article evaluates geography as an appropriate home for environmental education. First, it argues that many geographers have defined geography as a discipline with a major, if not primary, interest in human-environment interactions. Next, it reviews the recent statements by non-geographer, environmental scholars that, directly or indirectly, argue for strong participation by geographers in environmental science and sustainability studies. After a brief review of the status and the nature of environmental research programs and environmental curricula, the article offers reasons why more environmental education does not take place in geography. The lack of environmental education in the discipline and the conservative nature of the courses taught are attributed to geography's small size and low status and to the controversial nature of environmental issues in the United States. A broad definition of environmental education is used when searching for evidence of its existence or importance, but special attention is focused on courses or programs that incorporate sustainability or other topics that include a human dimension, in contrast with those that are confined to a narrow, natural-science or management conception.

ID EXPERIENCE
AB The promotion of education for sustainable development (ESD) is likely to be constrained by its compatibility with other missions and objectives of higher education institutions (HEIs). Finding space for ESD in the Enterprise Economy invites consideration of opportunities for increasing the visibility and audibility of environmental messages in HE sectors primarily committed to equipping national economies with skilled graduates. A survey of undergraduates registered for a physical geography module at the National University of Singapore was undertaken for three successive cohorts. Students fundamentally associate sustainability with resource-based definitions and usually construct environmental issues in terms of access to and utilization of the resource base. A limited articulation of environmental problems in neighbouring countries suggests that a geographical perspective ( emphasizing space and scale) could be usefully enhanced. However, the role of the geography discipline in best serving ESD is ambiguous given the need to infuse ideas through traditional disciplinary boundaries. Reflections on environmental awareness and attitudes among students in Singapore concur with UNESCO recognition that models for ESD must be locally defined in culturally appropriate ways.

DE sustainability; cultural resistance; spatial and teleological paradigms
AB Despite the great progress in increasing public awareness of and attention to the issue of sustainability, the measures taken so far fall dramatically short of halting deleterious cycles. This apparent deficiency can be ascribed to two main factors: insufficient efforts to finding viable and visible alternatives and the failure to thoroughly re-examine dominant cultural paradigms. The widespread resistance to adopting more sustainable habits, in spite of the patent environmental crisis, suggests that there are persisting epistemological substrates so compelling as to be called 'secular dogmas'. Higher education should undertake to promote both empirical research and applications, and systemic cultural critique. Geographers are among the most apt coordinators for such a complex interdisciplinary task. This paper shows the results of an international survey on some spatial, taxonomic and teleological macro-coordinates that underpin people's perception and representation of reality and thus influence the above-mentioned 'secular dogmas', which, if not properly addressed, may inexorably hinder the adoption of sustainable development models.

AB Rather than assuming New Zealand's educational sectors and institutions will be active and effective contributors to the United Nations Decade of Education for Sustainable Development (UNDESD) the authors ask instead: 'Are New Zealand's school and university sectors actually in a position to respond programmatically to the UN initiative?' The paper first reviews past efforts to introduce environmental education and education for sustainable development either directly or indirectly in the New Zealand school curricula and in university courses and degrees. The sobering conclusion is that by 2004 the gains could at best only be described as partial, limited and marginal, and certainly not transformational. The paper then reports on the first year of the UNDESD related activity in New Zealand. Again, the efforts have been minimal and the impacts negligible. The New Zealand evidence suggests that until understanding of the constraints of existing educational frameworks is taken seriously, prospects are slim for anything other than rhetorical and cosmetic adjustments in educational curricula and educational outcomes. This realization means early political effort associated with the decade should be concerned less with grand visions and the content of local projects and more with removing institutional obstacles and impediments to creating a 'sustainability mindset'.

AB The English higher education landscape has recently experienced a significant change with the addition of 74 Centres for Excellence in Teaching & Learning (CETLs), each one devoted to a particular educational issue or theme. This paper highlights a CETL which is of special interest to geographers in that it is focused on the promotion of education for sustainable development (ESD). The CETL is based at the University of Plymouth, UK, and is tasked with the responsibility of embedding a whole-university approach to sustainability. It will also seek to encourage best practice more widely, working with other institutions regionally, nationally and internationally.

AB This article explores aspects of teacher education and outdoor education and their relationship with sustainability education (SE) in Scotland. It considers recent national and international developments in the field and in particular the UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) initiative to 're-orient teacher education towards sustainable futures'. The implications of such initiatives in schools and teacher education institutes are discussed in the context of formal provision (e. g. geography) and informal opportunities (e. g. citizenship education, outdoor education). The emphasis is on the Scottish experience with the policy and practice of the School of Education of the University of Edinburgh being discussed as an example in relation to this national and international framework.

AB Environmental sustainability education, the dissemination of environmental education for sustainable development into the community, should be a lifelong process and not one restricted to a learner's years in higher education. Informal environmental sustainability education, including personal involvement in NGO environmental action, can be an effective way of increasing the understanding of environmental and sustainability issues. NGO projects help provide practical environmental education to environmentally aware people who have built their careers in other areas. In the process, they help environmental awareness to trickle into areas of life where it would not ordinarily impinge. In this case study of a community-based land reclamation research project, supported jointly by the NGO Earthwatch and Oxford Brookes University, analysis of the motivations and experiences of project volunteers shows that their aims include making a personal contribution to enhancing the quality of the environment and networking with like-minded individuals, and that they expect to carry their new understanding back into their everyday lives to influence other people in their workplace. Engagement in practical work and action research may help overcome some of the negativity linked to many assessments of the human impact on the environment and, working together, universities and NGOs can more effectively 'think globally and act locally'. NGOs may provide the best hope for helping to change the destructive aspects of modern society but they are vulnerable through financial dependency on sponsors, volunteers and donors.

AB This paper employs academic and parable forms to evaluate critically the strengths and weaknesses, potentials and lacunae of education for sustainable development (ESD) and other sustainability-related educations. The meteoric rise to prominence of ESD is first briefly reviewed, as is the firm ground it now stands upon as an international and national educational priority. The remainder of the paper explores the shaky ground of ESD: the field's reliance on a goal, sustainable development, which, in its by-and-large continued embrace of the growth principle, is a myopic response to the Earth condition; the field's embrace of an instrumentalist conception of nature when such a conception itself feeds unsustainability; the overly skills/training orientation of ESD and its stunted engagement with a range of key aspects of the human-nature relationship; the failure of ESD to realize its original breadth and promise in its marginalization of the voice of peace, social justice, anti-discriminatory, indigenous and futures educators as well as that of sustainability educators in the South; its adoption of an anachronistic 'steady state' conception of nature. Finally, it is suggested that sustainability-related education would be enriched and enlivened by fomenting a dynamic complementarity between notions of transience and sustainability

TI Does manipulation of fruit-tree architecture affect the development of
   pests and pathogens? A case study in an organic apple orchard
SO JOURNAL OF HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE & BIOTECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID MOVEMENT
AB Centrifugal training, based on the extinction procedure, is an innovative type of apple tree training recently used in French apple orchards. A thinning cut of fruiting spurs along the trunk, and on the proximal and underside parts of the fruiting branches modifies the within-tree leaf density and light environment, which is likely to affect the development of some apple pests and pathogens. In this study, development of the most serious foliar pests (aphids, mites) and disease (apple scab) was assessed over 3 years in an organic apple orchard with two training systems: the centrifugal training (CT) system, and the Original Solaxe (OS) system, using a bent axis with no removal of fruiting spurs, as a control. Infestation levels were significantly lower in 2002 and 2004 in the CT system than in the OS system for the most prevalent pest, the rosy apple aphid, Dysaphis plantaginea and, in 2003, for the red spider mite, Panonychus ulmi. Infestation by the green apple aphid, Aphis pomi, was higher in June 2002 and 2004 and lower in June 2003 in the CT system, compared to the OS control. The incidence of apple leaf scab was lower in the CT system than in the OS control in Spring 2002 and Spring 2004; but, later in the Summer, it increased more in CT trees, resulting in no difference between training systems in the levels of fruit infection at harvest. Hypotheses considered were based mainly on: (i) the removal of pests or inoculum due to the thinning cut of fruiting spurs for CT trees; (ii) effects on within-tree microclimate, providing a more aerated canopy in the CT system; (iii) shoot density and distribution, allowing greater distances between growing shoots in CT trees; and/or (iv) the shoot growth dynamics, allowing the presence of attractive or susceptible leaves in late June. Since the most serious apple pests and diseases were less prevalent in the CT system over the 3 years of the experiment, CT may prove to be a complementary, sustainable means to contribute to crop protection, especially in organic or integrated pest management orchards.

AB The tarnished plant bug, Lygus hesperus Knight, is a pest that causes considerable economic losses to vegetables, cotton, canola, and alfalfa. Detailed knowledge of its digestive physiology will provide new opportunities for a sustainable pest management approach to control this insect. Little is known about the different protease class contributions to the overall digestion of a specific protein. To this end, the proteolytic activities in female adult L. hesperus salivary gland and midgut homogenates were quantified over a range of pH's and time points, and the contribution of different classes of proteases to the degradation of FITC-casein was determined. In the salivary gland, serine proteases were the predominant class responsible for caseinolytic activity, with the rate of activity increasing with increasing pH. In contrast, both aspartic and serine proteases contributed to caseinolytic activity in the midgut. Aspartic protease activity predominated at pH 5.0 and occurred immediately after incubation, whereas serine protease activity predominated at pH 7.5 after a 9 h delay and was resistant to aprotinin. The salivary serine proteases were distinctly different from midgut serine proteases, based on the tissue-specific differential susceptibility to aprotinin and differing pH optima. Collectively, the caseinolytic activities complement one another, expanding the location and pH range over which digestion can occur. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Significant improvements in the profitability and sustainability of irrigated areas can be obtained by the application of new technologies. In this work, a model for the simulation of water flows in irrigation districts is presented. The model is based on the combination of a number of modules specialized on surface irrigation, open channel distribution networks, crop growth modeling, irrigation decision making, and hydrosaline balances. These modules are executed in parallel, and are connected by a series of variables. The surface irrigation module is based on a numerical hydrodynamic routine solving the Saint Venant equations, including the heterogeneity of soil physical properties. The simulation of water conveyance is performed on the basis of the capacity of the elements of the conveyance network. Crop growth is simulated using a scheme derived from the well-known model CropWat. The irrigation decision making module satisfies water orders considering water stress, yield sensitivity to stress, multiple water sources, and the network capacity. Finally, the hydrosaline module is based on a steady state approach, and provides estimations of the volume and salinity of the irrigation return flows for the whole irrigation season. The application of the model to district irrigation management and modernization studies may be limited by the volume of data required. In a companion paper, the model is calibrated, validated, and applied to a real irrigation district.

AB A one-dimensional water and solute transport UNSATCHEM model is calibrated and validated with a saline water use experiment for wheat and cotton crops. The model is further employed for regional scale salinity modeling with distributed data on soil, irrigation water supply, and its quality from six representative locations from the Kheri command of the Bhakra irrigation system. The wheat-cotton crop rotation, the main rotation in the command, is considered during long-term simulations. The CROPWAT model is used to determine the evapotranspiration requirements of different wheat and cotton crops, while soil water retention parameters are estimated by the RETC model. Atmospheric water and solute boundary conditions are assumed at the top boundary, while free drainage is considered for the lower boundary, as the watertable in the command is sufficiently deep. Simulated salinity and yield values are compared with observed values for regional validation of the model. Critical areas in the command are identified using regional scale modeling results, and applying irrigation water availability and root zone salinity criteria. Guidelines for sustainable conjunctive water use planning are for the Kheri command to get optimum agricultural production despite the use of saline water for irrigation under prevailing scenarios of water availability and its quality.

TI The US current account deficit and the expected share of world output
SO JOURNAL OF MONETARY ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
DE current account; real exchange rates
AB We investigate the possibility that the large current account deficits of the U.S. are the outcome of optimizing behavior. We develop a simple long-run world equilibrium model in which the current account is determined by the expected discounted present value of its future share of world GDP relative to its current share of world GDP. The model suggests that under some reasonable assumptions about future U.S. GDP growth relative to the rest of the advanced countries-more modest than the growth over the past 20 years-the current account deficit is near optimal levels. We then explore the implications for the real exchange rate. Under some plausible assumptions, the model implies little change in the real exchange rate over the adjustment path, though the conclusion is sensitive to assumptions about tastes and technology. Then we turn to empirical evidence. A test of current account sustainability suggests that the U.S. is not keeping on a long-run sustainable path. A direct test of our model finds that the dynamics of the U.S. current account-the increasing deficits over the past decade-are difficult to explain under a particular statistical model (Markov-switching) of expectations of future U.S. growth. But, if we use survey data on forecasted GDP growth in the G-7, our very simple model appears to explain the evolution of the U.S. current account remarkably well. We conclude that expectations of robust performance of the U.S. economy relative to the rest of the advanced countries is a contender-though not the only legitimate contender-for explaining the U.S. current account deficit.

DE mesoporous SnO2/SiO2 composite; crystal growth inhibition; high thermal

AB Mesoporous SnO2/SiO2 composite particles (Si/Sn <= 0.25) sustainable to calcination up to 600 degrees C have been fabricated using a stepwise sol-gel technique on nonionic surfactant template (tetradecylamine, TDA). The newly designed preparation method involved the pre-formation of SnO2 Sol solution from SnCl4. Subsequently, SnO2 nanocrystals were covered by the silicate species (from the hydrolysis of tetraethylorthosilicate, TEOS) in a pH controlled colloidal solution. Upon mixing with the surfactant solution, mesophase composite was obtained. After the removal of templates at various temperatures (400 to 600 degrees C), worm-like mesoporous SnO2/SiO2 with large specific surface area and pore volume as high as 362 m(2)/g and 0.33 cc/g were obtained, respectively. High thermal stability is mainly due to the effective inhibition of SnO2 crystal growth (mean crystallite size <30 angstrom) by the amorphous SiO2 species at the grain boundaries. Formation of mesoporous silicate skeleton such as M41S family material was prevented. The obtained materials maintain the relatively narrow pore size distribution typically in the range of 30 to 70 angstrom. Relations between material properties and key synthesis parameters (i.e. TDA/Si/Sn molar ratio and calcination temperature) were investigated by TGA, wide/small-angle X-ray scattering, (HR)TEM, BET, and FTIR techniques. Mechanisms on the mesostructure formation and crystal growth inhibition were also proposed with detailed discussion.

AB The Molten Salt Reactor (MSR) concept has recently been considered as one of the candidates for the generation IV nuclear power systems. MSRs have many advantages such as improved safety, proliferation resistance, resource sustainability and waste reduction. But MSR developmental activities have lagged and there are few data available to support detailed analyses. However, the authors believe that additional investigations are merited for future study. From this point of view, the authors have analyzed the depressurization accident of the MSR "Fuji-12" using a newly developed MSR transient analysis code. In Fuji-12, a small amount of helium gas bubbles are circulated in the primary loop for stripping out gaseous fission products. A depressurization of the primary system would cause these bubbles to expand, resulting in a positive reactivity insertion. We have attempted to determine the severity of such an accident. Although the analysis is still preliminary and the assumptions are crude, it can be expected that the depressurization would not result in a severe accident in Fuji-12.

TI Nocturnal foraging by great skuas Stercorarius skua: implications for

AB At St Kilda, Outer Hebrides, a large colony of great skuas Stercorarius skua feed extensively on one of the largest colonies of Leach's storm-petrels Oceanodroma leucorhoa in Europe, but little is known about the dynamics of this predator-prey system. Recently published population estimates of storm-petrels make it possible to estimate the impact of skua predation for the first time. Although skuas in the southern hemisphere catch petrels attending breeding colonies at night, it is not known whether congeners in the northern hemisphere also forage during the hours of darkness. We found (using radio-transmitters) that skuas regularly forage at night and (using light intensifying equipment) observed them catching storm-petrels at night. However, skuas also foraged during daylight hours, and it is unknown whether they might also catch storm-petrels at sea. Data on diet composition reveals that the proportion of storm-petrels in skua diet declined between 1996 and 1997, but remained constant thereafter. Although a large proportion of the storm-petrel prey is likely to consist of non-breeders, numbers consumed suggest that breeders and an unknown quantity of transients may also been eaten. The numbers of storm-petrels eaten are not sustainable and may result in substantial long-term population declines. Under current conditions, maintenance of large populations of both Leach's storm-petrels and great skuas at St Kilda appears to be mutually exclusive.

AB Rural governance in the UK and elsewhere has undergone far-reaching changes, as partnerships and other collaborative approaches have emerged to address the challenges of rural sustainable development. The legitimacy of this 'new rural governance' is purportedly grounded in deliberation between stakeholders, but this is problematic-it is not clear how 'legitimacy' is to be understood now that the criteria of legitimacy appropriate to representative democratic government are not obviously applicable.
   Here we propose an analysis of legitimacy as situated-that is, given meanings by actors in specific contexts-and continuously constructed through discursive processes, where it also plays a reciprocal, highly political role in shaping those processes. We use this framework to analyse decision making in three distinctive deliberative arenas for sustainable transport policy making in the Peak District National Park in England. Legitimacy claims were found to be significant elements in each arena, but no single, overriding legitimacy discourse was successfully established. Instead, each arena's legitimacy was a hybrid, justified through a complex mix of competing rationales.
   While no single conclusion can be drawn about the legitimacy of 'the new rural governance', the strongest legitimising principles remained those grounded in representative democracy. In contrast, the 'new' approaches rely on deliberative norms accepted only by (some of) the relatively limited circle of stakeholders directly involved. More generally, if such norms are to become accepted principles for legitimate rural governance, then more work is needed to discursively establish their acceptability both in networks of governance and with the wider population.

AB A new paradigm of multi-dimensional rural development has emerged which advocates a broader conception of the rurality where the rural is no longer the monopoly of the farmer. This new, broader paradigm needs to be reflected in the methodology of social scientific research, both generic and applied. In this paper we are primarily concerned with transfer of research methodologies utilised in development studies in the South to explore their usefulness for rethinking the European countryside. Such a transfer of methodology may be helpful, because integrated rural development can build on a long legacy in the South, while it has only recently been advocated in the EU context. The paper reflects upon the application of two such analytical concepts originating from development studies, which we have applied for research on the rural geographies in the European countryside, namely Sen's livelihood capabilities approach and Chambers' concept of participatory rural appraisal (PRA). Having the sustainable livelihoods approach as overall framework, both methodologies are qualitative in nature and address people's survival strategies and livelihood practices with a focus on micro-level analysis at individual, household (Sen) and community level (PRA), while reflecting their embeddedness in wider social, political and economic structures. Our comparative studies suggest that the prospects for bottom-up development, as orchestrated by PRA or similar approaches, is constrained by structural factors, which define the boundaries for local development. The capabilities approach is useful to detect the capabilities to act and be within which bottom-up approaches may take their-though limited-role in rural development. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Effects of tropical rainfall to the Ku-band satellite communications
   links at the equatorial atmosphere radar observatory
SO JOURNAL OF THE METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN
LA English
DT Article
ID PROPAGATION MEASUREMENTS; OLYMPUS SATELLITE; SYSTEM; 12-GHZ
AB This study investigates the effects of tropical rainfall on the Ku-band satellite communications links that connect Research Institute for Sustainable Humanosphere (RISH), Kyoto University in Japan to Equatorial Atmosphere Radar Observatory (EAR; 0.2 degrees S, 100.3 degrees E) in Indonesia, using the satellite Superbird C (144 degrees E in orbit). Rain attenuation of the up- and down-link radio wave signals is, for the first time, obtained at the same time in the tropics, monitoring each signal level that has been received at both stations in Japan and Indonesia for the past three years from 2003 to 2005. The up-link attenuation at each station can be estimated from the down-link signal level measured at its opposite station, because SCPC (Single Channel Per Carrier) signals used in this experiment are linearly amplified without saturation of the satellite transponders. At EAR in Indonesia, a slightly larger attenuation ratio between up and down links is statistically presented for the attenuation range of higher that 10 dB, suggesting the effects of smaller raindrop size distributions (DSD) than observed at RISH in Japan. This tendency is more conspicuous in the rainfall events when the observed attenuation shows only one peak in its time series, indicating the effects of simple convective precipitating clouds with one single cell. At RISH in Japan, a larger difference between worst month and yearly average statistics is found, due to a larger variation of the ground temperature that affects the slant-path length during the seasons, although the yearly average time percentages as such are larger at EAR than RISH up to the up-link attenuation of 15 dB. Using time percentages of their local rainfall rates, fairly good agreement is found between the observations and the ITU-R (International Telecommunication Union-Radiocommunication Sector) predictions for both locations. At EAR in Indonesia, however, the time percentages of the attenuation of more than 10 dB become significantly smaller than those predicted by the ITU-R methods for both up and down links. This indicates the remarkable reduction of equivalent path lengths down to about 2 km, caused by a fairly localized structure of convective precipitating clouds. Simultaneous X band radar observations have revealed that intense echo cores of typical rain cells causing severe attenuation are confined to about 2 km along the propagation path. This result, which seems rather small even compared with those obtained in other tropical observation sites, may be attributed to unique features of the EAR site that is located in a highland basin 865 m above the mean sea level and frequently observes simple precipitating clouds with a single cell.

DE sustainable urban distribution; rail freight developments
AB How far can rail freight developments reduce lorry movements and promote sustainable urban distribution when planners discard economically infeasible projects? To expand current dedicated bulk long rail hauls, marginally viable, from Plymouth, UK, potential rail traffics must tap capacity to treble output and cut unit costs. Potentially, aggregated inter-county bulk road movements imply viable train hauls from upgraded railhead facilities. Optimal configurations of enhanced loading, storage and processing facilities and port-railhead links proffer reduced ship demurrage costs with upgraded port handling and relocated petroleum-loading facilities creating employment and further reducing lorry movements. However, in practice, non-viable developments are not sustainable. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A Natural Environment Research Council research programme in the United Kingdom on biodiversity and ecosystem function in soil provided the opportunity to assess the extent to which soil fauna influence soils in a cool temperate grassland environment. There is much current debate about the sustainable use and degradation of such soils. Over a two-year period limed and control plots were investigated, the aim of liming being to perturb the ecosystem and alter soil biodiversity. Soils were studied for micromorphology and water-stable aggregation. Results demonstrate that the soils were dominated by excremental material from a limited range of species and that the size distribution of water-stable aggregates was similar to that of the major excremental forms. Despite the presence of a wide range of species in the experimental plots, the importance of a limited range of species is highlighted through the dominance of soil aggregates formed as a result of excretion by enchytraeids and earthworms. It is concluded that the studied soil ecosystem is highly resistant to change and that only a few species have key or strong ecological functions. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Transit-oriented development (TOD) planning generally emphasizes development efficiency, but ignores the other two aspects of sustainability: environment quality and social equity. This study has developed a multi-objective programming model for TOD planning. Based on the concept of sustainability, three objectives are considered: maximizing subway system ridership; maximizing living-environment quality; and optimizing the social equity of land development. The decision variables are the ratios of floor space to site space (RFS) for different land uses in subway station areas. Meanwhile, the constraints include restrictions on land use density, land use combinations, and level of service facilities. The Chunghsiao-Fuhsing station area in Taipei is chosen as a case study to illustrate the model application and planning results. From sensitivity analysis, it is found that enlarging the upper bound of RFS can increase subway ridership, but at a cost of reducing social equity and living environment. It is not necessary to set the upper bound of the RFS greater than 70%, because subway ridership does not significantly increase, in this case study. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Cultural landscapes are internationally valued resources, yet face endemic threats. Often the 'drivers for change' result in a loss of valued qualities, and are associated with 'vicious circles' of landscape deterioration. The way in which landscape may represent an integrative framework for research and policy is noted. It is argued that a key objective of research and policy should be to promote 'virtuous circles' in which social capital and economic entrepreneurship valorize distinctive landscape characteristics, leading to a situation of mutual reinforcement between human activity and environmental capital. Particular attention is given to qualitative models of virtuosity in the landscape. Positive feedback loops in the landscape are illustrated by reference to current examples of integrated rural projects. The further development of formal models as a basis for reinstating virtuous circles is advocated as a basis for the future planning and understanding of cultural landscapes.

AB To determine the stability and specificity of microbes associated with the marine cold-water sponge Geodia barretti during cultivation, we compared the microbial community of freshly retrieved specimens to that of cultivated explants by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). G. barretti hosts a specific homogeneous microbial community in its mesohyl, which is maintained during a cultivation period of 8 months. in 10-day-old explants, bright colonies of unusually large bacterial cells, located predominantly at canal walls, were observed in addition to the common bacteria. Bacteria of the aberrant type included both lineages present in whole sponges and foreign ones, notably numerous genera of sulfate-reducing bacteria. We assume that these represent infectious bacteria that eluded the innate immune system of the sponge. Explants that resist these microbial attacks during the critical phase of cultivation eliminate infectious bacteria' The intrinsic microbial community of G. barretti is not affected by these infections and remains persistent over a cultivation period of at least several months.

ID MANAGEMENT; TRAGEDY
AB While most commercial fisheries in the North Atlantic are strictly regulated through total allowable quotas, licenses and vessel quotas to limit the catch rates, the fishing for blue whiting represents an exception. Today, the blue whiting fishery is out of control; catch rates far exceed what the management authorities propose for a sustainable fishery and there is a real danger for collapse of the stock. The driving force in this development refers to the fact that the coastal states that are involved in the blue whiting fisheries, are not able to agree on the distribution of the migrating blue whiting stock. In Norway, the strong increase in both catch capacity and catch rates, also refers to a liberalization of the institutional framework for the renewal and design of new vessels, but also to structural politics concerning the ocean-going fishing vessels. This article presents the management conflict within the international fisheries for blue whiting and the driving forces behind the capacity increase in the Norwegian blue whiting fleet. However, a future agreement among the coastal nations within the framework of a sustainable fishery, inefficient overcapacity emerges when total quotas and allocation are put on the agenda. This results in allocation conflicts at different management levels that prevent a future solution. The question now is whether regional management organizations like the NEAFC (North East Atlantic Fisheries Committee) should have a more prominent position in the management of resources that migrate through the different coastal states' economic zones.

ID FISHERIES MANAGEMENT
AB Some authors defend the implementation of regulation mechanisms such as individual transferable quotas, that is, the capacity to assign every fisherman an individual right so that he can fish a certain quantity of a specific species during a concrete period of time, as the most efficient way to reach a greater resource assessment and to guarantee biological sustainability. Nevertheless, much attention has been brought to the fact that, since these rights can be sold, negotiated, exchanged or transferred by the owners, it can bring about a concentration process, which would not favour social equity.
   In Spain, fishing legislation has been moving progressively towards the implementation of individual transferable fishing rights with regard to industrial fishing in community waters, whereas it has also kept a more traditional access system regarding coastal fishing. Law 3/2002 sanctions this transferability of fishing rights, although it avoids making a statement on Individual Transferable Quotas (ITQs). In Europe, after the passing of the Reform of the Common Fishery Policy, the criteria to be developed in mechanisms in fishing management tend to favour ITQs, although no regulation guidelines exist yet.
   In this paper, the dynamics experienced by the Spanish fleet are highlighted and the mobility and volatility of fishing rights and their territorial consequences are analysed. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper reviews the emergence of the spatial dimension of marine and coastal zone administration, and examines several initiatives around the world that contribute to this idea. Spatial data have been recognised as an important resource to improve decision-making and resource management in both the land and marine environments in terms of sustainable development. Many countries are developing Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDIs) to improve access and sharing of spatial data, however, most of these initiatives stop at the coastline. Recently, global and regional activities such as the 3rd United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and the Sustainable Development Strategy for the Seas of East Asia (SDS-SEA) have brought to international attention the importance of effective administration of the marine and coastal environments.

AB The objective of this study was to explore the acceptability, feasibility, affordability, safety and sustainability of replacement feeding options for HIV-infected mothers in Ile-Ife, in south-west Nigeria. Six focus group discussions were conducted with a purposive sample of mothers, fathers and grandmothers. The HIV status of all participants was unknown to investigators. All text data were analysed using the Text-based Beta Software program. With regard to the acceptability of replacement feeds, respondents perceived the stigma associated with not breastfeeding to be an important consideration. In this community, breastfeeding is the norm - even though it is not necessarily exclusive. For infected mothers who choose to breastfeed exclusively and then to wean their infants before 6 months of age, respondents did not anticipate early cessation of breastfeeding to be problematic. Respondents noted that acceptable replacement foods included infant formula, soy milk and cow's milk. Barriers to replacement feeding that were mentioned included: the high costs of replacement foods and fuel for cooking; an unreliable supply of electrical power; poor access to safe water; and poor access to storage facilities. The research confirms the difficulty of replacement feeding for HIV-infected mothers in sub-Saharan Africa. The results also provide the basis for new issues and hypothesis for future research in other communities with similar socio-cultural and economic characteristics.

AB The Dadia forest complex, in the Evros prefecture, in north eastern Greece was designated as a nature reserve in 1980 in order to protect the black vulture (Aegypius monachus) and other raptors. In this paper, the impacts of the protection on the forest growth were assessed using geographic information system (GIS) technologies. The major requirement for almost all research needed for sustainable forest management is extensive and intensive monitoring. GIS is a convenient tool for integrating remotely sensed data and various other kinds geo-referenced data. Detailed spatial and temporal change patterns of the land uses in the area were quantified by interpreting aerial photographs of the years 1945 and 1973 and a satellite image of 2001. The results showed that the rate of forest growth is significantly larger during the second period (1973-2001) than during the earlier one (1945-1973). This is mostly due to the introduction, in 1980, of a protection regime, including two high-protection core areas, and a buffer zone. From 1945 to 2001 the openings which are important as hunting biotopes for raptors were significantly decreased. Apart from the protection of the area that was played an important role in the forest changes the effects of various landscape parameters (elevation, slope, distance from the roads and urban areas, aspect, soil depth, geology, erosion and forest density) on these changes were examined.

AB Low agricultural productivity caused by soil degradation is a serious problem in the Ethiopian Highlands. Here, we report how differences in soil fertility management between farming systems, based either on enset (Ensete ventricosum) or on teff (Eragrostis tef) as the major crops, affect the extent of nutrient stocks, balances and ecosystem sustainability. We collected information on farmers' resources and nutrient management practices from stratified randomly selected households in two watersheds in the Central Highlands of Ethiopia. In addition, we collected soil samples from each land use and calculated nutrient stocks, partial and full nutrient balances (N, P and K) for one cropping season. Our results show that farmers in the two farming systems manage their soils differently and that nutrient inputs were positively related to farmers' wealth status. The watershed with the enset-based system had higher soil N and K stocks than the watershed with the teff-based system, while P stocks were not different. Management related N and K fluxes were more negative in the teff-based system (-28 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) and -34 kg K ha(-1) yr(-1)) than in the enset-based system (-6 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) and -14 kg K ha(-1) yr(-1)) while P fluxes were almost neutral or slightly positive. Within the enset-based system, a strong redistribution of N, P and K took place from the meadows and cereals (negative balance) to enset (positive balances). Although in the teff-based system, N, P and K were redistributed from meadows, small cereals and pulses to maize, the latter still showed a negative nutrient balance. In contrast to nutrient balances at land use level, nutrient balances at the watershed scale masked contrasting areas within the system where nutrient oversupply and deficiencies occurred.

TI Informal caregiver training on home care and cancer symptom management
   prior to hospital discharge: A feasibility study
SO ONCOLOGY NURSING FORUM
LA English
DT Article
ID FAMILY CAREGIVER; INTERVENTION
AB Purpose/Objectives: To determine the feasibility of individualized caregiver training for home care and symptom management conducted at the bedside of older patients with cancer prior to hospital discharge.
   Design: Pilot study.
   Setting: The Extended Care Rehabilitation Center at the Durham Veterans Affairs Medical Center in North Carolina.
   Sample: 7 female informal caregivers with a mean age of 56 range = 26-76). More than half were African American. Most commonly, caregivers were spouses of the patients with cancer.
   Methods: Individualized and experiential training on home care and cancer symptom management was conducted at the bedside of patients before hospital discharge. Caregiver demographic data were collected. An informal interview at the end of the training asked about the usefulness of the training preparing for home caregiving.
   Main Research Varibles: Feasibility of the training.
   Findings: Individualized bedside training to caregivers prior to hospital discharge is feasible. All caregivers noted the relevance of the content as well as the approach to the training.
   Conclusions: When given an opportunity for training on symptom management and home care, informal caregivers were very interested in participating. The individualized approach gave caregivers an opportunity to have their particular needs met. The flexibility of when to conduct the training proved to be crucial when soliciting attendance. The biggest challenge was in recruiting caregiver subjects through patients with cancer.
   Implications for Nursing: The impetus now is to look at the effects of the training on caregiver-patient variables as well as the cost-effectiveness and sustainability of such an approach to caregiver training.

AB Background. The surgical therapy of glaucoma aims at an effective IOP lowering as well as at a long-term effect with few complications. The previous gold standard of combined surgery consisted of cataract surgery and trabeculectomy. The combination of cataract surgery and Erb:YAG goniotomy might be an alternative.
   Methods and patients. A total of 17 eyes were treated with combined Erb:YAG goniotomy. The control group underwent combined trabeculectomy and consisted of 23 eyes. The mean follow-up was 5 years and assessed IOP lowering, visual acuity, antiglaucomatous drugs, and complications.
   Results. After 5 years the IOP of the Erb:YAG group decreased from 23.3 to 16.9 mmHg. In the control group, the IOP was reduced from 23.3 mmHg to 15.8 mmHg. Two eyes of the Erb:YAG group needed further surgery due to unsufficient IOP control, whereas in the control group ten repeat procedures were necessary.
   Conclusions. The small number of complications in combination with a sustainable IOP-lowering effect seems to be an advantage in the long-term treatment of glaucoma. We hope that this can be transferred to the new excimer laser trabeculotomy since the 3-year results are already comparable to the Erb:YAG laser.

DT Article
DE bureaucracy; formalism; informal networks; jeitinho; personalism; social

AB This paper is a contribution to the existing body of literature on the Brazilian jeitinho (pronounced jaytcheenyoo) as an informal problem-solving strategy in organizations. The jeitinho is a social mechanism that entails bending or breaking the rules in order to deal with difficult or forbidding situations. It is a Particularly useful informal strategy to 'get things done' in work organizations. The paper focuses on what is involved in the interpersonal transaction of the jeitinho in work settings, acknowledging in particular the role of informal social capital and a highly valued interpersonal attribute in Brazilian society known as simpatia. The first part of the paper explores the defining features and historical roots of the Brazilian jeitinho; the second part provides a theoretical contextualization of the discussion through a brief review of academic works on bureaucratic dysfunctions and informal strategies to deal with these problems; and the third part illustrates the operation of the jeitinho with data from a qualitative study of a partnership sustainability program based in Belo Horizonte, Brazil.

AB There has been no clear trend in the total annual precipitation of the state of North Carolina during the 20th century. This holds for most individual stations, all climatic regions, and for the state as a whole. Seasonally, there have been no major trends in Winter or Spring precipitation. However, there has been a decrease in Summer (June, July, August) totals and an increase in those of Autumn (September, October, November). Although of approximately equal magnitude, these two trends were not complementary. The Summer decrease led to more frequent and larger soil water deficits, while the extra Autumn precipitation commonly fell onto soils already at field capacity, thus theoretically giving an increase in surface run off. This paper explores the causes of the precipitation trends through a frequency analysis of daily precipitation for selected individual stations. Part of the trend was directly associated with the number of rain days, which decreased in Summer, increased in Autumn. There were no clear trends in the average amount of rain per rain day, but for most stations the percentage of rain days having 1 mm or less increased in both seasons. Links with possible changes in atmospheric flow patterns are explored.

AB Wetlands in the polar desert environment of the High Arctic provide a special ecological niche for the tundra plants, insects, birds, and animals. Non-tidal patchy wetlands exhibit a hydrologic regime that includes a high water table and extensive flooding in the snowmelt period, followed by a gradual summer drying that is interrupted by rainfall events that raise water levels. These wetlands are also prone to inter-annual variations in wetness. Given sufficient local water supply, they are self-sustaining entities in which soil saturation favors ground ice formation, but the ice-rich permafrost prevents deep percolation while vegetation growth and peat development further insulate the ground. Several processes can alter this balance: a change in drainage can reduce inflow; excessive melting of ground ice leading to thermokarst can modify wetland morphology and flow pattern. On a regional scale, projected climatic warming of the Arctic may extend the thawed season, enhance evaporation, and eliminate the late-lying snowbanks that feed some patchy wetlands. Under such a scenario, patchy wetlands in the High Arctic are considered to be highly vulnerable.

AB Extensive karst aquifers developed in compartmentalized dolomitic strata constitute important groundwater reservoirs in semi-arid parts of South Africa. Located in the vicinity of densely populated and increasingly water-stressed metropolitan areas of Gauteng, these aquifers are of strategic importance for future water supply. However, many of the dolomitic groundwater compartments are severely affected by deep-level gold-mining operations. Apart from large-scale dewatering and associated modification of spatial and temporal water availability, gold mining also adversely impacts on the quality of remaining water resources. The focus of this paper is on uranium, a chemically toxic radioactive heavy metal identified by a number of previous studies as the contaminant of concern. Point- and non-point sources of U associated with mining activities in the Wonderfonteinspruit catchment, as an example of a dolomitic gold-mining area, as well as pathways of U pollution are discussed. Associated U loads emanating from major sources are estimated. The results suggest that detected levels of U pollution in the catchment are not only caused by century-old mining activities but also by current operations and that U pollution of water is likely to continue well beyond the closure of mines.

TI Remaking Arctic governance: the construction of an Arctic Inuit polity
SO POLAR RECORD
LA English
DT Article
AB This article focuses on the construction of the Inuit Circumpolar Conference (ICC), the aim being to offer the historical context within which the ICC came to serve as a significant voice for Arctic policy making and as a representative of Inuit peoples in general. It explores the role of the ICC in relation to the domestic, regional, and international political events taking place during its fort-native years in order to provide the basis through which the ICC came to be a political authority in the Arctic. While the main coalescence of events was around the theme of Arctic resource development, each event significantly helped lay the foundation for, and structures under which, Arctic policy would proceed into the future. This includes a changing Arctic narrative that has transformed the Arctic from a being a region concentrated on resource extraction and Cold War security into a region serving as a symbolic pinnacle for global sustainable development. Through the expanded political agency of the ICC and an international focus on the Arctic, a vision of the Arctic has emerged under which it is defined by its natural environment and by the indigenous peoples who inhabit this space. This is an INDIPO project paper (Tennberg 2006).

AB Perth has a dry climate with most rainfall confined to winter season. By recharging treated wastewater into suitable aquifers along the coastal margin of Perth, a range of benefits may be achieved including: (1) prevention of saline water intrusion; (2) restoration of groundwater levels; (3) water banking and withdrawal to balance seasonal differences in water supply; (4) improvements in water quality; and (5) flexibility in aquifer management. The technical key points to implement this wastewater reuse strategy are in the hydrogeological sustainability, groundwater contamination, and treated wastewater quality. Recent developments in wastewater treatment technology have made it possible to convert sewage into fair quality/potable water. With the available data on Perth groundwater, a cost-effective wastewater treatment process is designed, which is intended to fully utilize the geopurification function. Numerical analysis is performed to investigate the impact of the reclaimed water injection on Perth basin's hydrogeology and chemical, biological content in subsurface formations. Deep aquifer injection and shallow aquifer injection are both considered.

AB Sustainability in the context of China is an immediate and massive concept. A society of 1.3 billion has economic growth of 9-10% and a dramatic rise in life expectancy. It has rapidly-accumutating material wealth, major lifestyle changes and growing inequalities. It is putting great pressure on natural resources such as water and air quality. The Chinese Government's new 5-year plan uses the term 'sustainable development' as an important social goal for the first time. Sustainability requires a global effort and Sino-European partnerships are important. (c) 2006 The Royal Institute of Public Health. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: The objectives of the study were to (a) determine health promotion issues concerning disadvantaged elders, (b) identify social, economic, environmental, and personal factors that adversely influence disadvantaged elders' health, and (c) enable various stakeholders working within a coordinated framework to promote health among elders. Design: A participatory action research (PAR) model was used over a 2-year period in a remote disadvantaged rural village in Shaanxi province, China. Sample: Participants were 20 elders and 5 local administrators including government officers and village leaders. Results: Three themes were identified, including (a) health is the absence of illness and the ability to sustain self-sufficiency; (b) diseases are inevitable among elders; and (c) cost is the key barrier to accessing health services. Action plans were developed and plans were implemented by the participants and project team. Conclusions: The project demonstrated that PAR is an optimum research method, which allows researchers to facilitate collaboration with all participants through research and supports democratic dialogue and deliberation through the participation process. Interpersonal relationship skills of researchers are crucially important in building cooperation among all stakeholders. Local government mobilization is essential for successful implementation and sustainability of the project.

AB The present paper considers the two challenges of equity and efficacy, and it tries to specify the variables that influence each of them in a spatial approach. In order to do this, it draws on the existing literature, highlighting the differences in treatment depending on the approach, and also stressing the weaknesses. Overall, it is believed that the spatial dimension exacerbates the contradictions that arise from the implementation of sustainable development, in particular the contradictions that are likely to appear between a logic of sustainability and a logic of competitiveness. The paper concludes by examining the question of governance.

ID TAX CREDIT; KNOWLEDGE
AB Objective: This study, evaluated the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now's (ACORN) efforts to increase the uptake of families claiming the earned income tax credit through door-to-door canvassing and managing free tax preparation clinics in three pilot cities. Method: The mixed-method program. evaluation included administrative record review, a telephone survey (N = 1,063), and individual and focus group interviews. Results: During the 2003 tax year ACORN prepared taxes at no charge for 3,850 families who collected a total of $4 million in earned income tax credit and other tax credits. In two pilot cities, ACORN led all other free sites in number of returns filed. Canvassing and word of month were the most productive marketing tools for the free tax preparation sites. Conclusions: Canvassing appears to be effective outreach in,getting families to take advantage of free tax preparation. ACORN's approach to combining services and direct action organizing appears to be a good fit and sustainable.

ID PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT; FIRMS; INNOVATION
AB Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs) continue to be an important means of transferring technology. By incorporating the perspective of portfolio management, technology managers can use CRADAs to add value to their new product development process at any stage. Analysis of 124 alliances from. a U.S. government facility; known as a center of excellence for its R&D highlights the advantages of managing CRADAs by using a two-dimensional taxonomy: including both the type of agreement (constel-lation, exchange, process), and the stage in the technology life cycle (pre-versus post-dominant design). The portfolio should reflect the enterprise's strategic approach for achieving sustainable competitive advantage and creating customer value. Successful enterprises will remain mindful of the emergence of a dominant design and think broadly about portfolio structure. Long-term success will result from continual innovation that adds value to the network of relationships among competitors, vendors and customers.

DE recycling; life cycle assessment; plant nutrients; sewage sludge;

AB Recycling of plant nutrients in sewage products to arable land is considered to be a step towards a more sustainable society. Sewage sludge is the predominant sewage fertiliser product available today, but the use of sewage sludge in agriculture has been questioned as regards hazardous substances. In this respect, blackwater from separating systems seems to better fulfil agricultural requirements regarding fertiliser products.
   The objective of this paper was to analyse the environmental impact and resource use in a life cycle perspective for three systems, each including both wastewater handling and agricultural production. In the reference system, food waste disposers were installed in houses. Milled food waste and wastewater were treated in a wastewater treatment plant and the sewage sludge was used for producing a soil conditioner. In the sludge utilisation system, food waste from households was composted, wastewater was treated conventionally and sewage sludge was used in oat production. In the blackwater system, toilet water from low-flush toilets and milled organic waste were digested together and spread in growing oats. Data on the wastewater system were derived from simulations by the substance-flow model URWARE/ORWARE.
   The blackwater system required slightly more primary energy than the other two systems. In particular, construction of storage facilities contributed considerably to energy use. The emissions of greenhouse gases and SO2 were of the same magnitude for all three systems, while the eutrophying emissions were reduced significantly in the blackwater system. As regards NH3 and NOx, the emissions were highest for the blackwater system.
   High substitution of mineral fertiliser, optimal spreading technique and well-designed collection and storage facilities were important factors for the environmental outcome in the blackwater system. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study we analyze the energy and carbon balances of various cascade chains for recovered wood lumber. Post-recovery options include reuse as lumber, reprocessing as particleboard, pulping to form paper products, and burning for energy recovery. We compare energy and carbon balances of chains of cascaded products to the balances of products obtained from virgin wood fiber or from non-wood material. We describe and quantify several mechanisms through which cascading can affect the energy and carbon balances: direct cascade effects due to different properties and logistics of virgin and recovered materials, substitution effects due to the reduced demand for non-wood materials when wood is cascaded, and land use effects due to alternative possible land uses when less timber harvest is needed because of wood cascading. In some analyses we assume the forest is a limiting resource, and in others we include a fixed amount of forest land from which biomass can be harvested for use as material or biofuel. Energy and carbon balances take into account manufacturing processes, recovery and transportation energy, material recovery losses, and forest processes. We find that land use effects have the greatest impact on energy and carbon balances, followed by substitution effects, while direct cascade effects are relatively minor. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB The importance of soils in the environment is frequently overlooked and undervalued. It is therefore necessary to develop "soil awareness", within an educational process that is focused on a concept of sustainability in the man-nature relationship. There are many forms, moments and opportunities for environmental education based on a pedological approach. This ensemble of methods and topics represents Soil Education, an essential part Of environmental education. Soil education aims to bring the significance of soils into the lives of people, and consequently the need for conservation and sustainable land use. Just as environmental education, soil education is a formation process that must be dynamic, permanent and participative. A program of soil and environmental education was created that works with formal and informal education in the region of Vicosa. The program is theoretically and methodologically based on constructivism and the pedagogy of Paulo Freire, using a holistic approach, participative methods and practices of projects pedagogy. This approach does more than provide a learning process based on knowledge transference, by promoting investigation and experimentation based on the previous knowledge people have. The fact that soil is an important component of the natural and human environment everyone is familiar with makes meaningful learning possible and is a dynamic force for changing values and attitudes towards the environment, i.e., helps build an environmental/planetary awareness.

AB At the end of the nineties, many developing countries featured an open capital market and relied heavily on dollar-debt financing of their private sector. This paper analyses whether, in this context, adopting a clean floating exchange rate regime can be a sustainable policy choice. In the model, successive generations of investors must decide whether they hold or not the debt of a representative firm from the non-tradable sector. The exchange rate is subject to random shocks, which makes uncertain the firm's solvency. We show that a small risk of insolvency would bring about a much larger risk of illiquidity.

AB Bridges that cross streams can be greatly affected by channel instabilities, such as channel widening, lateral migration and channel bed degradation. Attention to channel conditions in the vicinity of bridges is an important aspect of bridge maintenance and safety. Channel stability is also critical to goals of multi-objective river management. Given that channel stability is important for both river management and the structural stability of bridges, any river management scheme should consider the stability of bridge-stream intersections. In this paper, the characteristics of bridge-stream intersections across the United States are described based on existing literature and recent field observations. A set of recommendations for addressing and improving channel stability at bridges is suggested, including: (1) controlling water and sediment discharges at the catchment level; (2) revegetating channel banks with woody vegetation; (3) reshaping the channel cross-section to a more stable, configuration; (4) removing disturbances from the stream channel, such as cattle and (5) using structures to control flow near channel beds and banks. The physiographic setting is a factor in the solution of at least the first three suggestions in this list. Attention to the physical characteristics of bridge-stream intersections in the various physiographic regions can lead to sustainable solutions for stabilizing channels at bridge-stream intersections.

AB The purpose of this 2-year study was to investigate Malawian teacher educators' perspectives and dispositions toward teaching about ecological sustainability issues in Malawi, a developing country in sub-Sahara Africa. This study was embedded in a larger theoretical framework of investigating earth systems science through the understanding of nature-knowledge-culture systems from local, place-based perspectives. Specifically, we were interested in learning more about eco-justice issues that are related to environmental degradation in Malawi and the potential role of inquiry-oriented pedagogies in addressing these issues. In a science methods course, the African educators' views on deforestation and teaching about ecological sustainability were explored within the context of the local environment and culture. Teachers participated in inquiry pedagogies designed to promote the sharing of perspectives related to the connections between culture and ecological degradation. Strategies encouraging dialogue and reflection included role-playing, class discussions, curriculum development activities, teaching experiences with children, and field trips to a nature preserve. Data were analyzed from postcolonial and critical pedagogy of place theoretical perspectives to better understand the hybridization of viewpoints influenced by both Western and indigenous science and the political hegemonies that impact sustainable living in Malawi. Findings suggested that the colonial legacy of Malawi continues to impact the ecological sustainability issue of deforestation. Inquiry-oriented pedagogies and connections to indigenous science were embraced by the Malawian educators as a means to involve children in investigation, decision making, and ownership of critical environmental issues.

TI "Road of giants": Nostalgia and the ruins of the superhighway in Kim
   Stanley Robinson's 'Three Californias Trilogy'
SO SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB In this essay I look at two novels in Kim Stanley Robinson's THREE CALIFORNIAs TRILOGY, The Gold Coast (1988) and The Wild Shore (1984), in which the image of the superhighway represents a site for the tension between progress and nostalgia and plays a key role as marker of future human survival. These books, as alternative futures, provide us with a choice: will we continue to create the conditions that will lead to our destruction, a highway to a future of ruins? Or will we try to harness the best of what technology has to offer in order to avert such a catastrophe? I argue that a focusing point for these debates is the superhighway, as a representation both of the "road to the future" and a road to nowhere. The THREE CALIFORNIA novels are concerned with finding a way to develop a balance between technological progress and the need for sustainable resource consumption. But both The Gold Coast and The Wild Shore also engage critically with the narratives of past and future expansion so evident in highway literature of the twentieth century. It is these narratives, embodied in the ruins of the superhighway, that I believe are important.

AB The importance of learning in natural resource management ( NRM) is being recognized by an increasing number of scholars and practitioners. A learning approach to NRM applies principles and theories of adult, organizational and social learning, and is underpinned by three core elements: systems thinking, negotiation, and reflection. By combining learning theories with concepts from adaptive management, comanagement, and participatory resource management, this article explores how the explicit inclusion of learning principles and processes can strengthen community-based natural resource management. Case studies from the South Pacific are used to draw out lessons for the wider application of learning approaches to NRM.

AB As sustainability becomes an increasingly common goal of international development programs, the need to focus on processes in addition to outcomes in program design, management, and evaluation becomes more apparent. Using a case study from the Philippines, this article explores how integrating development and research through adaptive management can help focus programs on process and sustainability. The case study programs - the Sustainable Agriculture and Natural Resource Management Collaborative Research Support Program ( SANREM CRSP) and the International Centre for Research in Agroforestry ( ICRAF) - were found to be effectively contributing to sustainable development, not because of a commitment to any particular quantifiable outcomes, but because of a willingness to engage in an evolving, learning-oriented process that is responsive to local people, integrates development with research, and is rooted in adaptive management. A well-integrated system of monitoring and evaluation is essential to this learning process and to maintaining program relevance.

AB This article explores whether vegetarianism is congruent with the alternative food economy. Although it has been largely neglected by scholars concerned with agro-food system alternatives, there are good reasons to undertake an exploration of vegetarianism in this context, not least because of the ethical relationships that it seeks to create within the food system. Drawing on recent work by Hilary Tovey in which she applies Eyerman and Jamison's cognitive approach to social movements, the article conceptualises vegetarianism as a social movement with the potential to effect change within the food system and, ultimately (perhaps), bring about rural development benefits. The article identifies and discusses a number of tensions and contradictions within the cognitive praxis of the vegetarian movement, and between the movement's cognitive praxis and external institutions, raising questions about the congruence between vegetarianism and the alternative food economy. It also makes some suggestions about the ways in which the vegetarian movement might reclaim a place at the table of the alternative food economy and in the process make a contribution to rural development. By way of conclusion, the article identifies a number of areas for possible future empirical research, as well as suggesting that the extension of an invitation to vegetarians to sit at the table of the alternative food economy has provided an interesting opportunity to reflect upon the menu on offer.

AB There is increasing environmental concern about the impact of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) on ecosystem sustainability and human health. Many EDCs are present within wastes which are routinely spread to land (e.g. biosolids). The aim of this study was to investigate the behaviour and fate of the EDC, 4-nonylphenol (NP), in a range of soils and to assess the potential risk it may pose to soil and freshwaters environments. We showed that NP was not persistent in soil, that NP mineralization was concentration-dependent and was stimulated by the addition of organic residues (e.g. biosolids, glucose, dead roots) but not by the presence of a rhizosphere. NP had no negative effect on soil respiration or plant growth unless present at extreme concentrations (>= 10,000 mg NP kg(-1)) and the uptake of NP by plants was very low. While NP was sorbed to the solid phase it could easily be leached from soil. Taking all of our results together, we conclude that the spreading of NP contaminated waste soil to soil probably poses a very low environmental risk to freshwater ecosystems and human health.

AB Burning of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) residue followed by plowing is a common management practice in wheat-soybean [Glycine Max (L.) Merrill] production systems in the mid-southern USA. However, this residue management practice is not environmentally friendly and may not be sustainable. The objectives of this study were to (i) evaluate the effects of N fertilization of wheat, residue burning, and tillage on soil surface carbon dioxide (CO(2)) flux in a wheat-soybean double-crop production system, and (ii) evaluate the role of soil temperature and soil moisture in controlling Co(2) flux in a relatively warm, subhumid environment. Soil surface CO(2) flux was measured nine times between June 2002 and October 2003 during the soybean growing season under all combinations of conventional- (CT) and no-tillage (NT) at high and low N fertilization levels with and without residue burning at two locations in the Mississippi River delta region of eastern Arkansas. Soil surface CO(2) flux was 37.6% higher (P < 0.01) from CT than from NT and 6.1% higher (P < 0.05) from the low than the high N rate treatment at one location, but not at the other. Burning did not affect soil surface CO(2) flux except for a significant burning X N rate (P = 0.016) and burning X time interaction (P = 0.032) at one location, but not at the other. Both soil temperature and moisture parameters were significantly negatively correlated with temperature-normalized soil surface CO(2) flux, but soil temperature, particularly at the 10-cm depth, explained more of the variation than did soil moisture parameters. The results of this study indicate that tillage and N fertilization of prior wheat, but not residue burning, affect the loss of C as CO(2) from the soil and that there are additional soil and/or environmental factors, other than near-surface soil moisture and temperature fluctuations, perhaps microbial biomass, that contribute to controlling soil surface CO(2) flux in wheat-soybean production systems in the subhumid region of southern USA.

AB Tillage affects the soil physical and chemical environment in which soil microorganisms live, thereby affecting their number, diversity and activity. However, soil disturbance generally has the greatest impact on biological properties, including both free and symbiotic fungal populations. Interest in more ecologically sustainable agricultural systems is rising with increasing recognition that agricultural intensification can adversely affect environmental quality. This paper discusses the effect of tillage system on some soil characteristics, such as pH, C, N and S levels, total and Olsen-P contents including some P forms associated with organic matter, glomalin contents and arbuscular mycorrhizae (AM) parameters, such as root colonization, spore number and total and active hyphal length. Measurements were in the sixth year of an on-going tillage-rotation experiment conducted on an Ultisol under no-till (NT), reduced tillage (RT) and conventional tillage with stubble mixed into the soil (CTS) or stubble burnt (CTB). Soil was sampled at two dates; after wheat (Triticum aestivum) harvest (autumn) and 6 months after subsequent grassland seeding (spring). Higher C, N, S, total P and fulvic acid-P concentrations and pH occurred under NT and RT than under CTS and CTB after wheat harvest. However, results at the second sampling were not consistent. AM spore number and active hyphal length were highest under NT having the greatest incidence on AM root colonization and P concentration in shoots of the pasture. Glomalin concentration was higher under NT and RT than under CTS and CTB but no differences in calculated glomalin to total C (ca. 5%) were found. It is concluded that a less disruptive effect of NT influences positively all soil characteristics and also increases P acquisition by the following crop in the rotation system.

AB This paper seeks to establish a practical definition of the term sustainable development, and relate it to a company's performance. Simulation and modelling tools are applied to gain a holistic view of the activities associated with a metal casting company, which includes production, transportation and recycling. In the simulation model, four case scenarios are investigated, including the comparison of original and re-designed cast products of 20% runner weight reduction, and the recycling of scrap metal at two different remelters. The focus of the case study is to monitor the amount of scrap, dross, carbon dioxide emissions from both energy consumption and transportation, productivity and costs during the metal material cycle. From the case study, various 'sustainability indicators' are highlighted. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

   development; homelands occupation
ID NATURAL-RESOURCE MANAGEMENT; CONSERVATION
AB This project investigates partnerships for environmentally sustainable development (ESD) in a remote part of Australia, from the perspective of indigenous groups, through grounded research involving priority setting, implementation trials and evaluation. By exemplifying the role of the indigenous non-government organizations (INGOs) and local clan representatives, recommendations for partnership design that enhance equity in partner engagement are suggested. Formalized roles for indigenous groups in communication, social planning and structural systems support can advance the social and cultural dimensions of ESD. Persons in communication roles might design communication tools and awareness raising material, or demonstrate technical equipment. Persons in social planning roles might coordinate and implement plans, and advise institutions about equitable programme design solutions. Persons in structural systems support roles could facilitate action learning, articulate citizen policy solutions and funding priorities and map spatial and structural boundaries and networks for environmental decision making. A person dedicated to each language group is advocated. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

AB The political objective calling for environmentally sustainable development has provided the canvas for lively dialogue amongst scientists and analysts. Be that as it may, what have been found wanting are operational conditions for the achievement of environmental sustainability within specific anthropogenic systems, with cities being cited as a prime example of such systems. Indeed, from a historical perspective, cities have always been based on the concentration of humans and man-made elements, resulting in respective confinement of natural assets. As cities possess particular properties for their environmental basis, the general conditions governing sustainability require suitable modifications when applied to cities. In this context, the present paper examines the conditions for environmentally sustainable development in urban systems. The specific natural and socioeconomic characteristics of urban systems are systematically taken into account for defining environmentally sustainable development in cities. The paper proposes an operational framework for evaluating urban systems for their environmental performance. Urban systems, presenting specific characteristics necessary for creating welfare with high density, ask for particular conditions for their environmentally sustainable development. These conditions differ substantially from those defining sustainability in broader geographical systems. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

   sustainability policy
AB The UK government has established an agenda for 'greening' government activity and, as it accounts for approximately 40% of all UK construction procurement, is actively encouraging sustainability initiatives in this particular sector. However, there have been criticisms of its approach. The UK government anticipates investing approximately 13 billion in the social housing sector over the next three years and, as a prelude to this, has asked the Housing Corporation to promote a raft of sustainable development initiatives. This paper draws on two tranches of data in order to examine the impact of the UK government's sustainability policy on the way the public sector procures housing construction. The first of these is the sustainability improvement targets from 143 public sector housing associations. The evidence from this first tranche of data suggests that sustainability is currently seen as a low priority and that government initiatives have yet to make a significant impact. The second tranche of data uses comments from housing association development managers to examine the reasons for this apparent lack of impact. This focuses on their views and opinions of sustainability as an issue in social housing development and enables inferences to be made about their attitudes to this issue., There has been criticism about the lack of progress so far seen and the results in this paper suggest that this criticism is justified.

AB In this paper, the impulsive exploitation of single species modelled by periodic Logistic equation is considered. First, it is shown that the generally periodic Kolmogorov system with impulsive harvest has a unique positive solution which is globally asymptotically stable for the positive solution. Further, choosing the maximum annual biomass yield as the management objective, we investigate the optimal harvesting policies for periodic logistic equation with impulsive harvest. When the optimal harvesting effort maximizes the annual biomass yield, the corresponding optimal population level, and the maximum annual biomass yield are obtained. Their explicit expressions are obtained in terms of the intrinsic growth rate, the carrying capacity, and the impulsive moments. In particular, it is proved that the maximum biomass yield is in fact the maximum sustainable yield (MSY). The results extend and generalize the classical results of Clark [Mathematical Bioeconomics: The Optimal Management of Renewable Resources, Wiley, New York, 1976] and Fan [Optimal harvesting policy for single population with periodic coefficients, Math. Biosci. 152 (1998) 165-177] for a population described by autonomous or nonautonomous logistic model with continuous harvest in renewable resources. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DT Article
AB This article explores one teacher education program's experiment in "turning the souls" of its students to help them understand and care deeply about issues of race and social justice, including issues of environmental sustainability. The Putney Graduate School of Teacher Education (1950-1964), a small "reconstructionist" program, was based upon Deweyan principles of choice, discovery, and student-generated learning and had as its underlying tenet a commitment to change the world. These goals created a tension between student independence and the program's political commitments. Nonetheless, students discovered reasons for education that lay beyond themselves, their experiences, the classroom, and their traditional notions of school. By immersing students in experiences that moved them emotionally, students developed a willing accountability for changing their world.

AB The maximization of productivity and labor efficiency has been a hallmark of the American agriculture and food system. The result of these twin processes is an industrial, concentrated, and consolidated provisioning system that produces cheap and plentiful food. Many view this model as a panacea for providing food to a modem industrial workforce, yet, increasingly, others are identifying cracks in this system. Research shows that an abundant food supply from an industrial model of agriculture has hidden costs to farm family stability, rural community well-being, and human and ecosystem health. A recent turn in this research has shifted away from the identification of weaknesses toward the exploration of viable options to redesign the food system in a manner that ensures long term sustainability. Civic agriculture is one such model that includes community-embedded initiatives to re-localize agriculture in communities of place, while enhancing food security, literacy, safety, and rebuilding rural communities. In this paper, I detail an exercise to teach the concept of civic agriculture through the development of community-based learning in the form of global and local public learning communities, service-learning advocacy, and international exchange. To demonstrate the comparative nature of agriculture and food system changes, as well as emerging models of sustainability, I developed a partnership with a Hungarian class which allowed students to compare and contrast approaches to sustainable development and probe the role of history and culture as causal forces in these endeavors. I describe my efforts to develop this partnership and weave opportunities for service-learning advocacy into the curriculum.

AB Transport represents a significant threat to long-term sustainable development, and is one of the fastest-growing consumers of final energy and sources of greenhouse gas emissions. Moreover, transport is heavily reliant on petroleum, a limited resource that is also associated with geopolitical risks to security of supply. Together, threats to the global environment and limited resource availability warrant a closer examination of possible pathways to a sustainable transport system. This study describes a sustainable automobile transport scenario based on the SRES B2 scenario, but with key demographic and economic drivers updated to incorporate developments between 1990 and 2000, and revisions to population projections. Multiple sustainable development objectives are incorporated, including: i) continuing economic growth, with a moderate reduction in disparities in income between different world regions; ii) maintaining a buffer of oil and gas resources to enhance security of energy supply, both globally and in vulnerable regions; iii) abating greenhouse gas emissions to ensure atmospheric CO2 concentrations do not exceed double pre-industrial levels; and iv) ensuring global mobility demands are met, without resorting to assumptions about a large counter-trend shift to public transport or lower travel demand. We then explore the technological, economic, fuel production and infrastructure implications of realizing this scenario over the long term. This provides a number of policy insights by identifying critical developments required for the emergence of a sustainable global passenger transport and energy system. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

AB This paper is concerned with the way technological expectations are generated, articulated and deployed in processes of large-scale socio-technical change. We argue that expectations are intrinsic to all social action, so that visions of the future are both ubiquitous and context-specific. Agents will act in relation to private visions of the future that are complexly related to shared or collective visions. Characteristic features and forms of visions as they relate to socio-technical regimes are identified, and the specific roles visions play in the context of actor networks engaged in processes of systems innovation are discussed. Visions are seen as 'bids' that are deployed by actors in processes of coalition-formation and coordination. Examples from a range of visions of more sustainable systems are used to illustrate the main arguments. The paper ends by discussing the normative features of socio-technical expectations.

AB Notwithstanding a significant expectation to increase the contribution of technology to productivity in megacompetition, the productivity of technology in Japan's high-technology industry has been declining, resulting in a decrease in competitiveness.
   The only solution to this twisted trap is to shift the current vicious cycle between R&D, technology stock and production to a virtuous cycle. Given strong constraints in fiscal investment, a practical solution to achieving a virtuous cycle is effective utilization of potential resources in innovation. A wider scope for patent claims can be an ingenious trigger leading to a virtuous cycle involving new functionality development, increased productivity of technology, production increases, greater R&D investment and a sustainable wider scope of patent claims.
   Japan's Patent Office introduced the Revised Examination Guideline (June 1993 Examination Guideline), including description requirements for patent applications. This induced leading high-technology firms to broaden their scope relative to claiming patents and succeeded in constructing the foregoing virtuous cycle, thereby demonstrating the significance of a new dimension of potential resources in innovation.
   On the basis of an empirical analysis focusing on techno-managerial efforts by Japan's pharmaceutical firms with both indigenous and the US capital, this paper attempts to demonstrate the foregoing hypothetical view.
   A noteworthy implication obtained from the research is that while leading pharmaceutical firms with indigenous capital have constructed a virtuous cycle by means of a wider scope of patent claims and have achieved new functionality development as a result, firms with the US capital have demonstrated a higher level of performance.

AB Assisted reproductive technology (ART), using the primary applied tools of AI, ET, and sperm and embryo cryopreservation, has been promoted over the past decades for its potential to conserve endangered wildlife, including felids. However, if the goal is efficient, consistent production of viable offspring for population management, then the 'potential' of ART has yet to become 'reality' for any non-domestic cat species. For the five small-sized felids (i.e., Brazilian ocelot, fishing cat, Pallas' cat, Arabian sand cat, black-footed cat) managed by Species Survival Plans (SSPs) in North American zoos, achieving this potential may be an absolute necessity if genetically viable captive populations are to be maintained into the next century. Modeling programs suggest that current SSP populations are not sustainable without periodic introduction of new founders and improved demographic parameters, including longer generation intervals and larger population sizes. ART provides the means to address each of these management challenges. In each small cat SSP species, fecal hormone metabolite assays and seminal analysis have proven useful for characterizing basal reproductive parameters, a necessary prerequisite to developing ART. Of the five SSP species, ART has been used to produce living offspring only in the ocelot, including after AI with frozen-thawed spermatozoa and following transfer of frozen-thawed IVF embryos. The true efficacy of these techniques, however, is still unknown. To improve the applicability of ART for population management, priorities for immediate research include further investigation of ovarian stimulation protocols, sperm and embryo cryopreservation methods, embryo culture systems, and fetal and neonatal viability following ART.

AB Relationships were developed to predict ammonia (NH3) nitrogen losses from cattle manure in animal housing, during manure storage, following field application, and during grazing. Ammonia loss in each phase was predicted using a mechanistic model for NH3 volatilized from the surface of an aqueous solution of ammonium where the NH3 is transported to the free atmosphere through a pathway with finite resistance. Ammonia emission rate was a function of the ammoniacal N content in the manure, ambient temperature, manure pH, manure moisture content, and the exposed manure surface area. Model relationships were calibrated by selecting values for the resistance to NH3 transport for the various loss pathways, which predicted daily and annual emissions similar to those reported in published studies. In further evaluation, these calibrated relationships predicted average annual losses similar to those documented in previous work over a range in climate locations. These relationships were integrated into a whole-farm simulation model to provide a tool for evaluating and comparing long-term nitrogen losses along with other performance, environmental, and economic aspects of farm production. Whole-farm simulations illustrated that the use of a free stall barn, bottom-loaded slurry storage, and direct injection of manure into the soil reduced NH3 emissions by 33% to 50% compared to other commonly used dairy housing and manure handling systems in the northeastern U.S. The improvement in nitrogen utilization more than offset the increased cost in manure handling, providing a small increase in farm profit. The farm model provides a research and teaching tool for evaluating and comparing the economic and environmental sustainability of dairy and beef production systems.

AB We hypothesise that differences in people's attitudes and personality traits lead them to attribute varying importance to environmental considerations, safety, comfort, convenience and flexibility. Differences in personality traits call be revealed not only in the individuals' choice of transport, but also in other actions of their everyday lives-such as how much they recycle, whether they take precautions or avoid dangerous pursuits. Conditioning on a set of exogenous individual characteristics, we use indicators of attitudes and personality traits to form latent variables for inclusion in an, otherwise standard, discrete mode choice model. With a sample of Swedish commuters, we find that both attitudes towards flexibility and comfort, as well as being pro-environmentally inclined, influence the individual's choice of mode. Although modal time and cost still are important, it follows that there are other ways, apart from economic incentives, to attract individuals to the, from society's perspective, desirable public modes of transport. Our results should provide useful information to policy-makers and transportation planners developing sustainable transportation systems. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB OBJECTIVE We assessed the feasibility and acceptability of and the willingness to use artemether-lumefantrine (Coartem) during early, appropriate treatment of malaria/fever in children aged 6-59 months at the community and household level in a rural malaria-endemic area in Ghana.
   METHOD In this descriptive study with a pre-post-evaluation of an intervention, community perceptions of fever, health-seeking behaviour and current treatment practices for children aged 6-59 months were ascertained through qualitative research and surveys. The children were counted in a household census and given identification cards. Community-based agents (who were supervised monthly) dispensed a 6-dose-treatment formulation of Coartem over a 4 months period and counseled caregivers on case management and referral. Caregivers who consulted were followed up after 4 days to determine adherence to the treatment regimen. Blister packs of the drugs were inspected where available. The performance of the agents in terms of counselling, advising on referral and reporting was evaluated. Community satisfaction was also assessed qualitatively through focus group discussions and interviews.
   RESULTS Three hundred and sixty-three children sought care during the intervention period. All 235 children aged 6-35 months were correctly provided the one tablet per dose per treatment package compared with 119 of 125 children 36-59 months (95.2%). Only 5 of 17 children were referred appropriately. All 334 caregivers followed the correct drug administration schedule, i.e. twice a day for 3 days. Validation of drugs received indicates that all 204 children aged 6-35 months and 103/ 118 (87.3%) children aged 36-59 months received the correct drug dose. Adherence of agents and caregivers to the treatment was 308/334 (92.5%). Delay in seeking care was reduced from 3 to 2 days. No serious adverse drug reactions were reported. Community members were enthusiastic about the performance of the agents.
   CONCLUSION A Home Management of Malaria (HMM) strategy with Coartem using trained community-based agents supervised monthly is feasible, acceptable, and can achieve high levels of compliance within Dangme, West District of Ghana. However, if the intervention is to be sustainable, the agents need to be paid.

TI Long-term emissions from mechanically biologically treated waste:
   Influence on leachate quality
SO WATER SA
LA English
DT Article
DE mechanical-biological treatment (MBT); landfills; MSW; leachate
AB Long-term emissions from municipal solid waste landfills can be reduced by mechanical-biological treatment ( MBT) of waste prior to disposal. The pretreatment accelerates waste degradation resulting in a reduction of the landfill's polluting potential. This study reports on the applicability and efficiency of MBT in Durban, South Africa. Waste treatment in passively aerated open windrows, using the Dome Aeration Technology (DAT), was identified as an appropriate technology due to low construction and operational resource requirements. Three self-aerated windrows were set up at the Bisasar Road Landfill in order to study the efficiency of the process for different composting timeframes ( 8 and 20 weeks). The 'post-landfilled` behaviour of the pretreated material was analysed in anaerobic lysimeters. The effect of different degrees of degradation was studied in relation to waste composition and rate of irrigation. The lysimeter tests demonstrated that the initial acidic inhibition that is characteristic of waste with high organic content can be eliminated through pretreatment. Notwithstanding the rapid onset of methanogenesis, high COD concentrations of non-degradable organics in the leachate remain after 200 d of testing. Despite the high COD levels, a clear benefit of waste pretreatment is the low concentration of ammoniacal nitrogen after only 8 weeks of composting. The results of this research can be used to de. ne a framework for sustainable waste disposal, particularly in relation to the subtropical climatic conditions experienced in Durban, resource availability and waste composition.

TI The Ecological Reserve: Towards a common understanding for river
   management in South Africa
SO WATER SA
LA English
DT Article
DE Ecological Reserve; ecosystem services; water allocation; policy
   interpretation
AB The legal requirement for an Ecological Reserve established in South Africa's water law is commonly regarded by stakeholders as being in direct competition with the needs of humans. This has resulted in much debate and varying interpretations of the meaning and purpose of the Ecological Reserve. However, the requirement for water that is allocated to sustain ecosystem functions is directly aligned with options for human use arising from rivers to deliver a suite of ecosystem goods and services to society. In this paper, we propose a conceptual approach to support a more constructive debate around the role and function of the Reserve in the sustainable use and protection of a suite of benefits to society. The approach proposes that debate be structured around managing for a dynamic ecological state in rivers that would in turn achieve the desired (albeit dynamic) mix of goods and services to a wide range of stakeholders. These stakeholders come from widely differing socioeconomic backgrounds, and their needs may be either for the direct use of water and associated resources located within the macro channels of rivers, or for their use in supporting social and economic activity remote from the river. The paper shows how goods and services concepts can provide an approach that contributes to developing a shared understanding that facilitates decisions on water allocations. The implication is that when water allocations can be evaluated comparatively it creates greater awareness of each other's needs and interdependencies and value is attached to a greater diversity of benefits and costs. This in turn allows for opportunities to achieve more equitable recognition and allocation of the resources associated with rivers. The approach assists in making the conceptual link between goods and services that arise from constructed production systems, and those that arise from natural production systems (i.e. ecosystems). Off-site as well as on-site use of river goods and services (the latter being catered for by the Ecological Reserve) can in this way be brought into debate in a way that promotes wider appreciation of society's diverse uses of river resources. In doing so it promotes interest-based participation as intended by legislation.

TI Contribution of rainwater harvesting technologies to rural livelihoods
   in Zimbabwe: The case of Ngundu ward in Chivi District
SO WATER SA

DT Article
DE rain-water harvesting; livelihoods; sustainable agriculture
ID SEMIARID CONDITIONS; QUANTIFYING RISK; WATER; MANAGEMENT; SYSTEMS
AB Water has long been regarded as the main limiting resource for crop production in the drought-prone region of sub-Saharan Africa in which Zimbabwe is located. However, the introduction of novel agricultural technologies such as rain-water harvesting (RWH) is seeking to mitigate the effects of these perennial droughts. The successful adoption of such technologies has the potential to alleviate problems faced by resource-poor 'subsistence' farmers. Thus this paper examines the contribution of RWH technologies to rural livelihoods in Zimbabwe and consequently to the sustainability of agriculture and rural livelihoods thereof. The methods employed included a questionnaire survey; key informant interviews and field observations. Benefits of RWH technologies found include an increase in agricultural productivity, enhancing household food security and raising of incomes. The technologies also assisted in improving environmental management through water conservation, reduction of soil erosion and resuscitation of wetlands in the study area. The major constraints facing technology adopters were water distribution problems, labour shortage, water-logging during periods of high rainfall and risk of injury to people and livestock as a result of some of the technologies. However, in an area like Chivi where there are frequent droughts and consequently food shortages among smallholder farmers, the benefits of RWH technology adoption seem to outweigh the costs. It was therefore concluded that RWH technologies are suitable for smallholder farmers in semi-arid areas if they are properly tailored to the conditions of the locality where they are promoted.

TI Cotton and corn rotation under reduced tillage management: impacts on
   soil properties, weed control, yield, and net return

   tillage; transgenic crop; soil quality; weed management
AB A 6-yr rotation study was conducted from 2000 to 2005 at Stoneville, MS to examine the effects of rotating glyphosate-resistant (GR) and non-GR (conventional) cultivars of cotton with corn under reduced tillage conditions on soil properties, weed control, crop yield, and net return. There were four rotation systems (continuous cotton, continuous corn, cotton-corn, and corn-cotton) for each non-GR and GR cultivar arranged in a randomized complete block design with four replications. Field preparation consisted of disking, subsoiling, disking, and bedding in the fall of 1999. After the fall of 2000, the experimental area received no tillage operations except rebedding after harvest each year to maintain reduced tillage conditions. A glyphosate-based program in GR cultivars and a nonglyphosate-based program in non-GR cultivars were used for weed management. Soil organic carbon in the top 5-cm depth progressively increased from the first year to the sixth year, regardless of rotation. In 2005, organic carbon was higher in corn grown continuously and in rotation compared to continuous cotton, partly due to higher plant residues from corn compared to cotton. Control of most grass and broadleaf weeds was sufficient. to support cotton and corn production, regardless of rotation and herbicide program. Control of yellow nutsedge was reduced in continuous non-GR cotton; this apparent weed species shift toward yellow nutsedge was mitigated by breaking the cotton monocrop with corn. Plant populations of both GR and non-GR cotton rotated with corn were similar to that of continuous cotton suggesting cotton stand establishment was not affected by corn residues from the previous year. Cotton yield increased every year following rotation with corn by 10-32% in the non-GR cultivar, and by 14-19% in the GR cultivar compared to continuous cotton. Similarly, corn yield increased by 5-13% in non-GR cultivar and by 1-11% in the GR cultivar when rotated with cotton. As a result, net returns were higher from rotation management as compared with monoculture in both crops. This study demonstrated that alternating between cotton and corn is agronomically feasible and a sustainable option for farmers in the lower Mississippi River alluvial flood plain region who are looking for simple cultural practices that provide economic and environmental benefits.

AB The South African abalone cultivation industry has developed rapidly and is now the largest producer outside Asia. With a rapid decline in wild abalone fisheries, farming now dominates the abalone export market in South Africa. Kelp (Ecklonia maxima) constitutes the major feed for farmed abalone in South Africa, but this resource is now approaching limits of sustainable harvesting in kelp Concession Areas where abalone farms are concentrated. This paper gives an overview of the development of the South African abalone industry and analyses how abalone farming, natural kelp beds and seaweed harvesting are interlinked. It discusses options and constraints for expanding the abalone industry, focussing especially on abalone feed development to meet this growing demand.
   Kelp will continue to play an important role as feed and kelp areas previously not utilised may become cost-effective to harvest. There are many benefits from on-farm seaweed production and it will probably be a part of future expansion of the abalone industry. Abalone waste discharges are not at present regarded as a major concern and fanning brings important employment opportunities to lower income groups in remote coastal communities and has positive spillover effects on the seaweed industry and abalone processing industry.

AB Utilization of carbon dioxide (CO2) has become an important global issue due to the significant and continuous rise in atmospheric CO2 concentrations, accelerated growth in the consumption of carbon-based energy worldwide, depletion of carbon-based energy resources, and low efficiency in current energy systems. The barriers for CO2 utilization include: (1) Costs Of CO2 capture, separation, purification, and transportation to user site; (2) energy requirements of CO2 chemical conversion (plus source and cost of co-reactants); (3) market size limitations, little investment-incentives and lack of industrial commitments for enhancing CO2-based chemicals; and (4) the lack of socio-economical driving forces. The strategic objectives may include: (1) use CO2 for environmentally-benign physical and chemical processing that adds value to the process; (2) use CO2 to produce industrially useful chemicals and materials that adds value to the products; (3) use CO2 as a beneficial fluid for processing or as a medium for energy recovery and emission reduction; and (4) use CO2 recycling involving renewable sources of energy to conserve carbon resources for sustainable development. The approaches for enhancing CO2 utilization may include one or more of the following: (1) for applications that do not require pure CO2, develop effective processes for using the CO2-Concentrated flue gas from industrial plants or CO2-rich resources without CO2 separation; (2) for applications that need pure CO2, develop more efficient and less-energy intensive processes for separation of CO2 selectively without the negative impacts of co-existing gases such as H2O, 02, and N-2; (3) replace a hazardous or less-effective substance in existing processes with CO2 as an alternate medium or solvent or co-reactant or a combination of them; (4) make use of CO2 based on the unique physical properties as supercritical fluid or as either solvent or anti-solvent; (5) use CO2 based on the unique chemical properties for CO2 to be incorporated with high 'atom efficiency' such as carboxylation and carbonate synthesis; (6) produce useful chemicals and materials using CO2 as a reactant or feedstock; (7) use CO2 for energy recovery while reducing its emissions to the atmosphere by sequestration; (8) recycle CO2 as C-source for chemicals and fuels using renewable sources of energy; and (9) convert CO2 under either bio-chemical or geologic-formation conditions into "new fossil" energies. Several cases are discussed in more detail. The first example is tri-reforming of methane versus the well-known CO2 reforming over transition metal catalysts such as supported Ni catalysts. Using CO2 along with H2O and 02 in flue gases of power plants without separation, tri-reforming is a synergetic combination of CO2 reforming, steam reforming and partial oxidation and it can eliminate carbon deposition problem and produces syngas with desired H-2/CO ratios for industrial applications. The second example is a CO2 "molecular basket" as CO2-selective high-capacity adsorbent which was developed using mesoporous molecular sieve MCM-41 and polyethylenimine (PEI).
   The MCM41-PEI adsorbent has higher adsorption capacity than either PEI or MCM-41 alon and can be used as highly CO2-selective adsorbent for gas mixtures without the pre-removal of moisture because it even enhances CO2 adsorption capacity. The third example is synthesis of dimethyl carbonate using CO2 and methanol, which demonstrates the environmental benefit of avoiding toxic phosgene and a processing advantage. The fourth example is the application of supercritical CO2 for extraction and for chemical processing where CO2 is either a solvent or a co-reactant, or both. The CO2 utilization contributes to enhancing sustainability, since various chemicals, materials, and fuels can be synthesized using CO2, which should be a sustainable way in the long term when renewable sources of energy are used as energy input.

AB The reaction of carboxylation of alcohols is a sustainable technology for the synthesis of dialkylcarbonates that avoids the use of phosgene. In this paper we describe the behaviour of metal alkoxides of Group 5 elements as homogeneous catalysts in the above reaction, and the isolation and characterization of the active species, i.e. the hemicarbonates formed upon insertion of carbon dioxide into the M-OR bond. Ta and V alkoxo complexes are comparatively discussed with respect to the Nb-analogues, whose synthesis and catalytic properties have been published [M. Aresta, A. Dibenedetto, C. Pastore, Inorg. Chem. 42 (10) (2003) 3256, and references therein].
   In this paper, we report for the first time the evidence of insertion of carbon dioxide in tantalum alkoxides [Ta(OR)(5)](2) [R = methyl (Me), ethyl (Et)]. The relevant hemicarbonates Ta(OR)(4)[OC(O)OR] have been characterized using spectroscopic techniques (IR and NMR). Tantalum alkoxides and the vanadium compound VO(OR)(3) are shown to be able to catalyze the carboxylation of alcohols at 413 K and 5.5 MPa of CO2.
   The trend of reactivity for the Group 5 alkoxides as catalysts for the carboxylation of alcohols is Nb >> Ta > V (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.. All rights reserved.

AB Morphological linkages and discontinuities have been defined in both natural and anthropogenic terms. Such terms are considered useful in understanding the spatial and temporal roles of erosion from source areas, as indicated by linkages, when they are in operation, and by discontinuities, which act as storages or buffers in stabilizing landscapes. The latter slow erosion and promote conservation particularly in Mediterranean areas, where human impacts are thought to be more important than natural processes. These concepts are illustrated by reference to three case studies in the Durance Valley: in a part of a Mediterranean landscape, on a floodplain segment and along of the main channel. While there are major concerns in more semiarid parts of these seasonally dry zones, present conditions in the more humid south of France, supplied also by exotic upper catchments, are under less threat of degradation. This is until such times when water shortages may occur, due to changed regimes, as anticipated in the predicted global warming climate changes, and by the continuing development in this area.

AB Studies on multi-group multi-criteria decision-making problems for oil spill contingency management are in their infancy. This paper presents a second-order fuzzy comprehensive evaluation (FCE) model to resolve decision-making problems in the area of contingency management after environmental disasters such as oil spills. To assess the performance of different oil combat strategies, second-order FCE allows for the utilization of lexical information, the consideration of ecological and socio-economic criteria and the involvement of a variety of stakeholders. On the other hand, the new approach can be validated by using internal and external checks, which refer to sensitivity tests regarding its internal setups and comparisons with other methods, respectively. Through a case study, the Pallas oil spill in the German Bight in 1998, it is demonstrated that this approach can help decision makers who search for an optimal strategy in multi-thread contingency problems and has a wider application potential in the field of integrated coastal zone management.

AB Sustainable decisions in hydrological risk management require detailed information on the probability density function (pdf) of the model output. Only then probabilities for the failure of a specific management option or the exceedance of critical thresholds (e.g. of pollutants) can be derived. A new approach of uncertainty propagation in hydrological equations is developed that directly propagates the probability density functions of uncertain model input parameters into the corresponding probability density functions of model output. The basics of the methodology are presented and central applications to different disciplines in hydrology are shown. This work focuses on the following basic hydrological equations: (1) pumping test analysis (Theis-equation, propagation of uncertainties in recharge and transmissivity), (2) 1-dim groundwater contaminant transport equation (Gauss-equation, propagation of uncertainties in decay constant and dispersivity), (3) evapotranspiration estimation (Penman-Monteith-equation, propagation of uncertainty in roughness length). The direct propagation of probability densities is restricted to functions that are monotonically increasing or decreasing or that can be separated in corresponding monotonic branches so that inverse functions can be derived. In case no analytic solutions for inverse functions could be derived, semi-analytical approximations were used. It is shown that the results of direct probability density function propagation are in perfect agreement with results obtained from corresponding Monte Carlo derived frequency distributions. Direct pdf propagation, however, has the advantage that is yields exact solutions for the resulting hydrological pdfs rather than approximating discontinuous frequency distributions. It is additionally shown that the type of the resulting pdf depends on the specific values (order of magnitude, respectively) of the standard deviation of the input pdf. The dependency of skewness and kurtosis of the propagated pdf on the coefficient of variation of input parameter uncertainty is detected to be non-monotonic with distinctive maxima.

AB Despite the extraordinary success in the development of anthelmintics in the latter part of the last century, helminth parasites of domestic ruminants continue to pose the greatest infectious disease problem in grazing livestock systems worldwide. Newly emerged threats to continuing successful livestock production, particularly with small ruminants, are the failure of this chemotherapeutic arsenal due to the widespread development of anthelmintic resistance at a time when the likelihood of new products becoming commercially available seems more remote. Changing public attitudes with regards to animal welfare, food preferences and safety will also significantly impact on the ways in which livestock are managed and their parasites are controlled. Superimposed on this are changes in livestock demographics internationally, in response to evolving trade policies and demands for livestock products. In addition, is the apparently ever-diminishing numbers of veterinary parasitology researchers in both the public and private sectors.
   Industries, whether being the livestock industries. the public research industries, or the pharmaceutical industries that provide animal health products, must adapt to these changes. In the context of helminth control in ruminant livestock, the mind-set of 'suppression' needs to be replaced by 'management' of parasites to maintain long-term profitable livestock production. Existing effective chemical groups need to be carefully husbanded and non-chemotherapeutic methods of parasite control need to be further researched and adopted, if and when, they become commercially available. This will require veterinary parasitology researchers from both the public and private sectors to work in close co-operation to ensure 'sustainability' - not only of the livestock industries that they service - but also for their very own activities and enterprises.

AB In order to evaluate the epidemiology of parasitism in farmed ruminants in the changed agricultural context in Kazakhstan, 505 cattle, sheep and goats were surveyed for gastrointestinal parasitism using coprological examination, and a further thirty sheep and four goats using post mortem extraction of helminths. The dominant helminth genera were Marshallagia, Nematodirus and Trichostrongylus. Haemonchus was also present. Faecal egg counts were low (mean abundance 0-115 eggs per gram in different groups), and there was no relationship between faecal egg density and body condition score. Eggs of Nematodirus spp. were more common in sheep less than 1 yr of age, whereas those of the Trichostrongylidae were generally more common in adult sheep. Based on faecal egg counts, sheep grazing on common land close to permanent human settlements were generally no more heavily infected than those grazing the remote open plains. This could be due to a non-linear relationship between livestock numbers and stocking density. We suggest that cessation of strategic nematode control in the region following post-Soviet agricultural reform was offset by a general reduction in stocking density, such that parasite burdens remained low. However, recovery in livestock numbers is likely to lead to increased levels of infection and production loss unless sustainable control strategies are put in place. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB This study looks at two distinct questions: 'What have been the most influential journal articles in environmental economics and ecological economics over the 10-year period 1994-2003?'; and 'How much overlap is there between the fields of environmental and ecological economics?' We examine the references in all articles published in JEEM and Ecological Economics (EE) over this period. For each of these two fields, a list of the top articles and top journals cited by articles published in JEEM and EE is presented. We also present some results based on our study of the ISI Journal Citation Reports. We find that there is a significant overlap between the two fields at the journal level - the two journals cite similar journals. There is a correlation of 0.34 between the number of citations received by the journals that are most cited and the correlation is even higher if journal self-citation is excluded. The main differences are that ecological economics tends to cite (but not be cited by) general natural science journals more often than environmental economics does, environmental economics cites more heavily from journals rather than other publications, and citations in environmental economics are more concentrated on particular journals and individual publications. However, there is much less similarity at the level of individual articles. Non-market valuation articles dominate the most cited articles in JEEM while green accounting, sustainability, and the environmental Kuznets curve are all prominent topics in EE.

AB Integrated fruit production (IFP) has been practiced in Switzerland on a large scale basis since the late 1980s, with the aim of improving sustainable fanning. The guidelines of IFP emphasise an ecosystem approach that is based on scientific knowledge about self-regulatory mechanisms at the tree and orchard level. Empirical studies at the farm level are rare. An understanding of the relationship between income and environmental impacts at the farm level is a prerequisite for devising a robust system for orchard portfolio management. An income analysis based on full cost principle and environmental life cycle assessment were applied to 445 annual data sets of apple orchards, recorded on 12 specialised fruit farms over a period of 4 years. The main result was that environmental impacts such as ecotoxicity, eutrophication and non-renewable energy use did not necessarily increase when farms increased their income. A higher input level of pesticides, fertilisers and machinery did not lead to increased yields and receipts. In contrast, the choice of apple cultivars and high investment in pre-harvest labour hours were significantly correlated with high eco-efficieney and high farm income. The results of this study were summarised in a pyramid-shaped management model, providing key issues of successful orchard farming and attributing management rules to master them. The management pyramid indicates that cognitive competences such as distributional, conditional and non-linear thinking are crucial when knowledge from tree and orchard management is integrated at the farm level. A main recommendation is that more attention should be paid to improving management competence in order to contribute to sustainable farming. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Resource throughput in the economy (e.g., of energy or materials) must be progressively reduced by at least one order of magnitude to achieve an optimal level. Although this would solve the resource distribution conflict between the generations, it would also aggravate the resource distribution conflict between persons of the same generation. It is shown here that a solution to these two conflicts and efficient resource allocation are only possible if resource certificates are distributed to consumers free of charge and traded between them.
   This paper builds on and integrates ideas developed in H. Daly's [Daly, H.E., 1992. Allocation, distribution, and scale: towards an economics that is efficient just, and sustainable. Ecological Economics 6, 185-193.] article on allocation, distribution, and scale, adding insights from the ecological footprint concept, to propose a mechanism for facilitating intergenerational equity and drastically reducing resource throughput. Basically the mechanism involves rationing throughput equitably, internalizing environmental and social externalities, and substituting labour for resource use. This can be achieved almost without a drop in prosperity. Both unemployment and dependence on scarce resources decline. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Recent research has warned that liberalising trade in capture fish products originating from inefficiently managed fisheries might cause over-exploitation, reduced fish stocks and thereby a reduced steady-state of welfare. This paper qualifies the warning in a case study of the East Baltic cod market by developing an,age-structured bio-economic supply model combined with basic theory of trade between two countries. Welfare effects of trade liberalisation are identified taking fishing quotas, input limitations, mesh-size regulations and shared ownership of stocks into account. It is shown that although liberalising trade in products supplied by such a fishery might cause steady-state welfare reductions in the supplier countries, these welfare reductions are small compared to the welfare gains from a hypothetical change to optimal management. Hence, the introduction of better fisheries management is much more important than trying to meet potential negative consequences of trade liberalisation since even small improvements in fisheries management may offset the negative effects of trade liberalisation.

AB The paper summarizes fuel cycle strategies which can call for the development of accelerator driven systems (ADS) and shows how an ADS-based transmutation strategy can be envisaged in a regional context. Finally, a path towards the demonstration of the ADS concept will be proposed, which accounts for the need of developing a consistent strategy of dedicated fuel development and validation with long-term irradiation programs.

   international collaboration; IAEA coordinated research project
AB Four major challenges are facing the long-term development of nuclear energy: improvement of the economic competitiveness, meeting increasingly stringent safety requirements, adhering to the criteria of sustainable development, and public acceptance. Meeting the sustainability criteria is the driving force behind the topic of this paper. In this context, sustainability has two aspects: natural resources and waste management. IAEA's activities in the area of Partitioning and Transmutation (P&T) are mostly in response to the latter. While not involving the large quantities of gaseous products and toxic solid wastes associated with fossil fuels, radioactive waste disposal is today's dominant public acceptance issue. In fact, small waste quantities permit a rigorous confinement strategy, and mined geological disposal is the strategy followed by some countries. Nevertheless, political opposition arguing that this does not yet constitute a safe disposal technology has largely stalled these efforts. One of the primary reasons cited is the long life of many of the radioisotopes generated from fission. This concern has led to increased R&D efforts to develop a technology aimed at reducing the amount and radio-toxicity of long-lived radioactive waste through transmutation in fission reactors or sub-critical systems. In the frame of the Project on Technology Advances in Fast Reactors and Accelerator-Driven Systems (ADS), the IAEA initiated a number of activities on utilization of plutonium and transmutation of long-lived radioactive waste, ADS, and deuterium-tritium plasma-driven sub-critical systems. The paper presents past accomplishments, current status and planned activities of this IAEA project. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The evolution of resistance in insect pests will imperil the efficiency of transgenic insect-resistant crops. The currently advised strategy to delay resistance evolution is to plant non-toxic crops (refuges) in close proximity to plants engineered to express the toxic protein of the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt). We seek answers to the question of how to induce growers to plant non-toxic crops. A first strategy, applied in the United States, is to require Bt growers to plant non-Bt refuges and control their compliance with requirements. We suggest that an alternative strategy is to make Bt seed more expensive by instituting a user fee, and we compare both strategies by integrating economic processes into a spatially explicit, population genetics model. Our results indicate that although both strategies may allow the sustainable management of the common pool of Bt-susceptibility alleles in pest populations, for the European corn borer (Ostrinia nubilalis) one of the most serious pests in the US corn belt, the fee strategy is less efficient than refuge requirements.

ID THIN-FILM; DROPLETS; SURFACES; SCALE; SPIN
AB We report a new patterning process which takes place as a result of demixing of a binary polymer/ solute mixture. An efficient, sustainable approach for ordering nanosized rings of so-called single molecule magnets (SMMs) is thus provided. It exploits the self-organization process in which SMM patterned film evolves to a spatially correlated pattern of nanosized rings. At long time, the anisotropic patterning of the film drives the ring to coalesce, into parallel lines of nanometric width.

AB The existence of biologically differentiated populations has been credited with a major role in conferring sustainability and in buffering overall productivity of anadromous fish population complexes where evidence for spatial structure is uncontroversial. Here, we describe evidence of correlated genetic and life history (spawning season linked to spawning location) differentiation in an abundant and highly migratory pelagic fish, Atlantic herring, Clupea harengus, in the North Sea (NS) and adjacent areas. The existence of genetically and phenotypically diverse stocks in this region despite intense seasonal mixing strongly implicates natal homing in this species. Based on information from genetic markers and otolith morphology, we estimate the proportional contribution by NS, Skagerrak (SKG) and Kattegat and western Baltic (WBS) fish to mixed aggregations targeted by the NS fishery. We use these estimates to identify spatial and temporal differences in life history (migratory behaviour) and habitat use among genetically differentiated migratory populations that mix seasonally. Our study suggests the existence of more complex patterns of intraspecific diversity than was previously recognized. Sustainability may be compromised if such complex patterns are reduced through generalized management (e.g. area closures) that overlooks population differences in spatial use throughout the life cycle.

AB The extent of dispersal by pelagic larvae in marine environments, including coral reefs, is central for understanding local population dynamics and designing sustainable marine reserves. We present here the first example of a clear stepping-stone genetic structure throughout the Caribbean basin for a common coral reef species, the French grunt (Haemulon flavolineatum). Analysis of microsatellite DNA markers indicated that French grunt population structure may be characterized by overlapping populations throughout the Caribbean, influenced by independent population dynamics but with no fixed geographical boundaries. In addition, different spatial genetic patterns were found in different oceanographic regions. A second species, the bluehead wrasse (Thalassoma bifasciatum), has a much longer pelagic larval duration than French grunts and showed no explicit spatial pattern of genetic variation. This finding is concordant with the hypothesis of a positive relationship between larval dispersal and duration in the plankton. While the magnitude of the genetic signal of population structure in French grunts was very low (F-ST = 0.003), the pattern of isolation-by-distance throughout the Caribbean indicated considerable population structure with important ecological and conservation significance.

AB A smooth transition from gasoline-powered internal combustion engine vehicles to ecologically clean hydrogen fuel cell vehicles depends on the process used for hydrogen production. Three technologies for hydrogen production are considered here: traditional hydrogen production via natural gas reforming, and the use of two renewable technologies (wind and solar electricity generation) to produce hydrogen via water electrolysis. It is shown that a decrease of environmental impact (air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions) as a result of hydrogen implementation as a fuel is accompanied by a decline in the economic efficiency (as measured by capital investments effectiveness). A mathematical procedure is proposed to obtain numerical estimates of environmental and economic criteria interactions in the form of sustainability indexes. On the basis of the obtained sustainability indexes, it is concluded that hydrogen production from wind energy via electrolysis is more advantageous for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and traditional natural gas reforming is more favorable for reducing air pollution.

AB Intensive rice cultivation in a coastal groundwater basin in Balasore district of Orissa province (eastern India) during monsoon and winter seasons has resulted in extensive pumping of groundwater by a network of shallow, mini-deep and deep tubewells. Particularly, shallow tubewell owners using centrifugal pumps are unable to lift groundwater during winter seasons due to rapid drawdown of groundwater table below suction lift caused by mini-deep and deep tubewell owners. The seawater intrusion front is also progressing inland in an alarming rate. To develop a long-term sustainable land and water management strategies for the aforementioned issues in humid regions, the district administration realized the need for crop planning and water resources management policies in deterministic and stochastic regimes. As non-structural measure, the Deterministic linear programming (DLP) and chance-constrained linear programming (CCLP) models were developed to allocate available land and water resources optimally on seasonal basis so as to maximize the net annual return from the study area, considering net irrigation water requirement of crops as stochastic variable. These models were solved using the quantitative systems for business (QSB) software package. Sensitivity analysis of the models has been carried out by varying three ranges of cropping scenarios (20, 40 and 50% deviation from the existing cropping pattern) and combinations of surface water and groundwater at various risk levels (10, 20, 30 and 40%). The total groundwater available and withdrawal in the region are 655.87 x 10(3) and 255.03 x 10(3) km(3), respectively. The study reveals that 40% deviation of the existing cropping pattern is the optimal that satisfies the minimum food requirement and maintain geo-hydrological balance of the basin. The sensitivity analysis of conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater shows that 20% surface water and 30% groundwater availability as the optimum water allocation level. The proposed cropping and water resources allocation policies of the developed models were found to be socio-economically acceptable that maintained the balance of the entire system, considering all the constraints and restrictions imposed.

AB Himalayas are ecologically fragile, and unplanned exploitation of natural resources is severely affecting water flow regimes in the mountainous watersheds. Therefore, it is imperative to quantify the effect of different environmental and morphological factors on flow behavior in the micro-watersheds to efficiently plan and execute water management practices in a sustainable manner. In this study, three hilly micro-watersheds were gauged in Uttaranchal State of India to assess the impact of morphological characteristics and land uses on surface runoff, base flow and total flow. Artificial intelligence (AI) models based on the multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) technique were employed to predict surface runoff, base flow, and total flow as affected by rainfall and morphological features of the micro-watersheds. Daily rainfall, runoff, base flow, and total flow data recorded from July 1, 2001 to June 30, 2003 in the three watersheds, were used to develop and validate MARS models. The average correlation coefficients between the observed and predicted runoff, base flow, and total flow for the unseen test datasets were 0.573, 0.884, and 0.881, respectively. The corresponding average deviations were -0.113, -0.02, and -0.04 mm, and the average absolute deviations were 0.171, 0.187, and 0.267 mm, respectively. Thus, the analysis revealed that base flows and total flows, as predicted by MARS, were in close agreement with the observed values while the surface runoff predictions were reasonable at best. MARS analysis determined that 5-day antecedent precipitation index (API(5)), rainfall, day of the year, runoff estimated by using curve number method, and watershed area are the most important variables for simulating runoff in hilly watersheds. Soil cover and watershed geometry parameters also affected runoff generation which are indirectly covered in the estimation of runoff by curve number method. In order to explore applicability of MARS models on ungauged watersheds, data from two watersheds were used to develop MARS models, and tested on the third watershed. The observed and predicted values of flows were found to be in a reasonably good agreement. The correlation coefficients for the unseen test datasets varied from 0.391 to 0.648 for surface runoff, 0.736 to 0.879 for base flow, and 0.789 to 0.886 for total flow. The prediction for surface runoff can improve further if more data on surface flow events are available. Therefore, it is concluded that MARS models have the potential to simulate runoff in hilly areas and can be applied satisfactorily to ungauged watersheds under identical agro-climatic situations.

AB Exploitation of agar, algin and carrageenophytic seaweeds in south east coast of India has increased significantly over the past few decades. Hypnea musciformis is one of the species exploited and the harvesting pressure could have negative consequences on the sustainability of this resource. Although demand for raw material of H. musciformis continues to increase, basic knowledge on requirements to cultivate this indigenous carrageenophyte is lacking. In this study, experiments were conducted along the southeast coast of India for 21 months from June 2001 to February 2003 on the seasonality of growth of H. musciformis, growth on polypropylene and coir ropes, the effect of seedling density, depth of water and duration of culture period to optimise its field cultivation. Biomass yield (g fw m(-1)) and Daily Growth Rate (DGR) (%) were determined. Results showed that the biomass yield was lowest in January (8.0 +/- 1.5g fw m(-1)) and significantly different (P < 0.001) than the highest biomass yield in August (403.0 +/- 10.0g fw m(-1)). Biomass yield increased with increase in seedling density (30g fw m(-1) and above). Higher DGR (7.6-10.9%) were determined for 10g fw m-1 initial seedling density and it differed significantly (P < 0.001) from the DGR of all other seedling densities. The depth of water had a considerable effect; biomass yield (130.0 +/- 15.0g fw m(-1)) and DGR (7.0 +/- 0.6%) were maximum at the surface (0cm depth) and significantly different (P < 0.001) at depths of 30, 60, 90 and 120cm. Duration of cultivation period was not a limiting factor in H. musciformis. The higher biomass yield was obtained in 75 and 150 days after plantation. Biomass yield (35.0 +/- 4.5g fw m(-1)) and growth rate (3.8 +/- 0.2%) were lowest in minimum duration (25 days) and significantly different to 150 days after plantation (P < 0.001) during all culture periods. Biomass yield (50.0-305.0g fx m(-1))and DGR (3.8-9.6%) were consistently higher on coir rope and significantly different (P < 0.001) when compared to polypropylene rope during all culture months. The observed seasonality of response to culture H. musciformis; higher biomass yield in higher seedling densities; higher biomass yield and DGR at the surface with little impact of duration of culture period and higher DGR and biomass yield on coir rope suggest cultivation is possible throughout the year along the southeast Indian coast. The findings of the present study suggest that the cultivation of H. musciformis on coir rope is viable and fisher folk can take up such activities as a part-time income generating activity in southeast Indian coast.

AB The use of sustainable harvest practices in the tropics is often proposed as a way to maintain the environment and address the poverty issues that dominate many tropical regions of the world. In theory, the adoption of these methods can provide win-win solutions to tropical deforestation because they address the en viron men tal consequences of deforestation while increasing the welfare of forest inhabitants. However, there is little reliable data that can be used to test this hypothesis since many of the goods produced in sustainable systems do not have well-defined markets and are most often consumed at home. This paper examines the benefits of collecting and harvesting non-timber forest products in the tropics through various methods using household panel data collected in 1996 and 2000 in the Ouro Preto do Oeste region of Rondonia, Brazil. We estimate the use-value of land under forest, agriculture, and pasture and complement these estimations with census data and regession analysis. Our estimations reveal that households utilizing sustainable practices in the forms of agroforestry and the collection of non-timber forest products have significantly higher levels of diversification. We conclude that directing policy towards "win-win" strategies may not be desirable for reducing both poverty and deforestation in this region since we find no clear evidence that these can successfully be addressed simultaneously. Sustainable development policy should focus on increasing the value of the forest, or reducing the opportunity cost of leaving standing forest on the household lot, if sustainable production strategies are to be more attractive to households in the future.

AB In particular radical innovations can be important means to achieving improved sustainability. Due to the existence of path dependency and lock-in, however, the transition from one technological trajectory to another, more sustainable one is often impeded by significant barriers. Fortunately, these barriers are by their nature subject to substantial changes in time; so, it makes sense to carefully distinguish between periods of stability (showing high barriers) in which the given trajectory can hardly be left and periods of instability (characterized by low barriers) where a new trajectory can be reached more easily. The latter distinction matters since sustainable innovations often rely on governmental regulation and the economic burden arising from this regulation will be much lower in periods of instability. Moreover, due to the complexity and dynamics of change in their respective environments, innovations are generally associated with fundamental uncertainty such that it becomes impossible to predict the degree of sustainability yielded by specific innovations in the longer run. Under these circumstances, it is essential to facilitate the change between trajectories and to allow for the possibility to select between a variety of alternative trajectories within a process of trial and error. Sustainability as viewed from this evolutionary perspective is therefore better understood as the general capability to adapt, that is, to readily change from less to more sustainable technological trajectories. Since the latter kind of sustainability determines the conditions under which the former kind (i.e. sustainability, related to a specific technology) can be achieved, the two kinds are respectively called second-order and first-order sustainability.
   Finally, a series of determinants (and corresponding indicators) from the techno-economic, political, and socio-cultural sphere is identified which, after proper measurement and weighting, allow for making an assessment whether and when the incumbent industry is sufficiently destabilized and the political system rendered sufficiently favorable to the new, more sustainable technology such that a transition to the preferred trajectory is possible without too much effort.

AB Ecological footprint methodology, as an excellent educational tool applicable to global issues, is essential for quantifying humanity's consumption of natural capital, for overall assessments of human impact on earth as well as for planning for a sustainable future. At present, quantitative studies on the development trends of ecological footprint (EF) time series and biological capacity (BC) time series in a given region are still rare. In this paper, we present two quantitative estimate indices over time scale called the change rate and scissors difference, which describe quantitatively the development trends of EF and BC and the difference between both trends in a long time series. For a case study of Gansu province in western China, we calculated the change rates and scissors differences of per capita EF and BC from 1991 to 2015, analyzed the development trends in the past 13 years and predicted those in the following 12 years. We have, by using GIS and geostatistics, also produced a prediction map that contains 13 annual maps interpolated for the per capita ecological budget data of 87 counties in Gansu between 1991 and 2015. This map can reflect the spatiotemporal patterns and trends of ecological sustainability in spatiotemporal dimension, which coincide with the results from the time series using the two indices. As shown by our results, the negative change rates of per capita EF (1991-1993) indicate a descending trend of per capita EF and the positive change rates (1994-2015) indicate an ascending trend afterwards. The negative change rates of per capita BC (1991-2015) indicate a descending trend of per capita BC. The scissors difference growing from 1991 to 2015 shows that the difference between EF and BC is increasing rapidly. The state of ecological development has been unsustainable since 1998. The primary factor leading to the unsustainability is the increasing consumption of fossil energy, which has doubled in the past 13 years. The analysis suggests four strategies for the local governments. The purpose of our work is to point out the need for research into the development trends of EF and BC time series in spatiotemporal dimension. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID INDICATOR
AB In conjunction with ecological performance, a definition to sustainable economic development was proposed, and a novel triangle method was designed to evaluate economic development sustainability, based on the interrelationships among economic development, resource-energy consumption, and environment pollution. As a case study, the triangle method was applied to assess the sustainability status and long-term trends of China's economic development. The results show that economic development in 2000 represents a relatively weak state of sustainability; and that most of the 31 political regions in Mainland China reflect sustainability positions ranging from weakly unsustainable to weakly sustainable. The China's economic development between 1980 and 1991 reveals a rather weak sustainability trend, while that from 1991 to 2000 demonstrates a relatively strong sustainable trend. China's unremitting efforts in environmental protection over the last two decades would be responsible for these status and trends. The triangle method, as an intuitive platform for illustrating sustainability status and trends in economic development, seems to hold promise as an analytical management tool given its simplicity, ease of use, and flexibility.

AB The quantity and distribution of vegetal biomass are important aspects to consider in ecosystem studies. However, little information is available about Brazil's Pantanal woodland savannas. This work involved the development of regression equations of the aerial biomass and wood volume of native tree species in a region of woodland savanna on Rio Negro farm in the Pantanal of Nhecolandia, Brazil. Samples were taken from 10 trees of each of five species: Protium heptaphyllum (Aub1.) Marchand, Magonia pubescens A. St.-Hil., Diptychandra aurantiaca Tul., Terminalia argentea Mart. and Zucc. and Licania minutiflora (Sagot) Fritsch and from a miscellaneous group of I I different species. Linear and nonlinear regression analyses were developed relating the diameter at breast height to the dry weight of wood, branches and leaves, wood volume and total aerial biomass. All the regressions showed a significance of P < 0.05 and an R-2 close to or above 0.8. The biomass curve predicted by linear regression analysis of the studied species was similar to the nonlinear regression, with the exception of L. minutiflora and the miscellaneous group. The breast height diameter proved a good choice for estimating biomass and wood volume. The estimated wood volume and biomass of the Pantanal woodland savanna is crucial information for understanding the carbon cycle and for ensuring the region's conservation and sustainable use.

AB Diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A epoxy (E) was modified with hydroxyl-termiriated polydimethylsiloxane through a ring-opening addition polymerization reaction. The structural elucidation of the siloxine-modified epoxy resin (ES) was carried out with Fourien transform infrared, H-1-NMR, and C-13-NMR spectroscopy techniques. The physicochemical characterization of the synthesized resin (ES) was performed with standard metho(;. E and ES were subjected to paint formulation with the help of a rutile (TiO2) pigment. The formulated paint systems were cured at room temperature with 1,6-cliaminohexame (AH) and 1,3-diaminopropane (AP), which were used as curatives. The E-AH, E-AP, ES-AH, and ES-AP paint systems were applied to mild steel strips. The physicomechanical and anticorrosive performance of the coated panels was evaluated with standard methods. The thermal analysis of these E-amine and ES-amine systems was carried out via thermogravimetric analysis. The effects of siloxane incorporation and amine curatives on the coating properties of the paint systems were also investigated. The ES-AP system exhibited good thermal and corrosion stability performance among all the E and ES paint systems. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB This paper examines 10 reservoir performance metrics including time and volume based reliability, several measures of resilience and vulnerability, drought risk index and sustainability. Both historical and stochastically generated streamflows are considered as inflows to a range of hypothetical storage on four rivers-Earn river in the United Kingdom, Hatchie river in the United States, Richmond river in Australia and the Vis river in South Africa. The monthly stochastic sequences were generated applying an autoregressive lag one model to Box-Cox transformed annual streamflows incorporating parameter uncertainty by the Stedinger-Taylor method and the annual flows disaggregated by the method of fragments.

AB A functional network of green space is important for the maintenance of the ecological dimension of a sustainable urban landscape. We used avian ecological diversity as a proxy for evaluating the functionality of different types of urban green space. The urban landscape of the municipality of Orebro in Sweden was stratified into four strata (City centre, Residential, Greenway and Periphery). Bird species found in these strata were classified into four ecological groups with decreasing degree of specialisation (woodpeckers, hole-nesters, forest birds and urban birds). Overall there was lower bird species richness in the City centre and Residential areas compared to the Greenway and Periphery. Woodpeckers, hole-nesters and forest birds showed an increasing trend in the number of species as well as individuals from the City centre to the Periphery while urban birds showed the opposite trend. The amount and quality of green space as well as natural vegetation increased from the City centre to the Periphery. Species richness of woodpeckers, forest birds and hole-nesters were positively correlated with tree density while urban birds showed an inverse correlation. There was no dead wood in City centre, Residential and Greenway in contrast to the Periphery, which held some dying trees, stumps and old windthrows. Our findings emphasise the importance of urban green space with natural structures to maintain high ecological diversity. Finally, we discuss how conflicts between habitat for biodiversity maintenance and other functions of green space could be handled by zoning. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI A Relational Indicatorset Model for urban land-use planning and
   management: Methodological approach and application in two case studies
SO LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING

ID HOLISTIC LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY; QUALITY
AB Urban land-use planning and management are in constant mutation throughout the world. With sustainability as the goal, the use of indicators for land auditing and monitoring is becoming more and more in demand.
   Classical approaches elaborate core sets of indicators by picking the most relevant elements in exhaustive lists. More recently, a few structured research approaches consider the set of indicators as a whole, following the concepts of systernics, and so highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of the sets.
   Starting from the principle that the relevance of an indicator is due not only to its intrinsic qualities, but also to its placement and relationships with the other indicators in the collection, this paper proposes a systemic method, named Relational Indicatorset Model (RIM), for the elaboration of a set of indicators for management support.
   The RIM method starts with the a priori definitions of the goals and users' purpose (RIM-objectives), and then chooses indicators to reflect the objectives on representing the distribution of indicators in a relational graph (RIM graph). The graph modeling allows analyzing the match between the indicatorset and the defined objectives, as well as the interrelationships between the indicators. The analysis is made easier by breaking down the RIM graph following two projections: the first one (RIM-4D) highlights the distribution of the indicators in a multidimensional graph with respect to the objectives; the second one (RIM-IR) focuses on the interrelationships and offers the possibility of formalizing the causal interactions and the aggregational relationships between the indicators, following a qualitative approach.
   The RIM is applied to the design of sets of spatial and non-spatial indicators for the cities of Thies (Senegal) and of Geneva (Switzerland) to emphasize the potential of the method. It opens up interesting possibilities for application to all sets of indicators for sustainable land-use development. It also contributes to the creation of observatories for city management, instruments used to monitor and control the urban sustainable development. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Mammea americana L. is tropical plant in the Clusiaceae family that bears edible fruit. Mammea coumarins are isoprenylated derivatives of the lactones of the 2-hydroxy-Z-cinnamic acids that are bioactive and have limited distribution in three Clusiaceae genera. Qualitative and quantitative analyses were performed to determine the distribution of mammea coumarins in the seed nucleus, seed coat, fruit flesh, fruit skin, leaf, stem, and root of M. americana using high-performance liquid chromatography-photodiode array detector (HPLC-PDA) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LCMS). Ten major mammea coumarins,mammea E/BD (1), mammea E/BC (2), mammea E/BA (3), mammea E/ BB (4), mammea B/ BA hydroxycyclo F (5), mammea B/ BD (6), mammea B/ BC (7), mammea B/ BA (8), mammea B/ BB (9), and mammea B/ BA cyclo F (10), were isolated and identified from the seed nucleus of M. americana and employed as standards. The HPLC- PDA method was validated with respect to sensitivity, linearity, recovery, accuracy, and precision. The total content (w/w%) of the 10 major mammea coumarins in M. americana was determined to be highest in the root (0.75%), followed by the leaf (0.64%), seed nucleus (0.48%), fruit skin (0.11%), stem ( 0.08%), seed coat (0.02%), and fruit flesh (< 0.01%). The leaf and seed nucleus are rich and sustainable natural sources of mammea coumarins. Additionally, the described HPLC-PDA and LC-MS methods are sensitive and accurate and can be applied to the analysis of mammea coumarins in other samples.

AB The EU Environmental Noise Directive (2002/49) requires member states to deliver noise maps to the commission by 2007 and action plans by 2008 both for agglomerations as well as for major roads, railways and airports. Noise mitigation projects resulting from action plans are usually very expensive and therefore may threaten the economic viability of the railways in the current harsh competitive transport market, thus hindering sustainable transport policies. It is therefore of vital interest that the action plans and the resulting projects are designed in the most cost-effective way possible. The EU and Union of Railways (UIC) sponsored project Strategies and Tools to Assess and Implement noise Reducing measures for Railway Systems (STAIRRS) recognized this need and developed a tool, with which such optimal solutions can be obtained for entire railway networks. Since data collection is the most expensive part of the analysis, noise mapping data is ideally collected in such a way that it can be used for the calculation of the different scenarios, from which the most cost-effective action plans are chosen. The paper shows how the STAIRRS tool is used for this purpose and how costeffectiveness considerations have led to optimal railway noise mitigation strategies in Switzerland and have given a basis for noise related decision making in Luxembourg.

TI Discovery of cellulose as a smart material

ID STRUCTURAL-CHANGES; WATER
AB The past 10 years has witnessed a renewed interest in cellulose research and application, sparked mostly by technological interests in renewable raw materials and more environmentally friendly and sustainable resources. In this paper, we further expand the current knowledge in cellulose applications and technologies by reporting our discovery of cellulose as a smart material that can be used for biomimetic sensor/actuator devices and micro-electromechanical systems. This smart cellulose is termed electroactive paper (EAPap). It can produce a large bending displacement with low actuation voltage and low power consumption. The actuation phenomenon and its characteristics are illustrated in this paper. Because cellulose EAPap is ultra-lightweight, inexpensive, and biodegradable, it is advantageous for many applications such as micro-insect robots, micro-flying objects, micro-electromechanical systems, biosensors, and flexible electrical displays.

AB Converting the environmental services of tropical forests from public goods to tradable services is a promising approach to sustaining tropical forests' ecosystem functions and services. We hypothesize that the development of markets for these environmental services will substantially depend on compliance with requirements of key market actors representing supply and demand sides. This paper analyzes market actors' decision criteria related to engagement in tropical forestry projects that provide environmental services. In a questionnaire survey, 45 experts from Latin America and Europe representing key market actor groups, i.e., certifiers, consulting companies, financial institutions, governmental organizations, industrial companies and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), were asked to name and weight criteria that tropical forestry projects should meet in order to attract their institution's engagement. Many of these 45 institutions are already involved in several market activities related to tropical forestry projects and environmental services, including asset management, certification, consultancy, credit business, investments, project ownership and trade/brokerage. The collected criteria cover a variety of topics that clearly go beyond frequently applied sustainability dimensions in forestry related multi-criteria based decision making, i.e., social, environmental and economic dimensions. For example, relatively many criteria involve topics such as project management, risk management or marketing. While differences in criteria weighting among market actor groups are not significant, we found a significant interaction between criteria weights and the provenance of participants, indicating that Latin American and European market actors nominate and weight single decision criteria differently. The five criteria with highest mean weights in the European sample are social benefits, legal compliance, sustainability, environmental benefits and stakeholder participation. The Latin American market actors weighted highest expertise and capacity building, financial resources, political aspects, information management and markets. Generally, Latin American market actors emphasize criteria related to markets and information/knowledge management, whereas European participants tend to assign importance to social and environmental benefits and sustainability. The survey provides preliminary insights into bottom-up defined decision criteria relevant for key-actors in the market of tropical forestry-based environmental services, and compiles information for further multi-criteria based assessments of tropical forestry projects providing environmental services.

ID AUSTRIA 1830-1995
AB The energy balance of the 1860-1870 agrarian system in a Catalan county (Spain) shows a 1.41 energy return on energy inputs. This positive figure was achieved despite the high intensive Mediterranean organic agriculture then practiced and its unavoidable dependence on the inefficient livestock bioconversion of biomass to obtain manure and traction. The key feature was the integration between agricultural, pasture and forest lands mainly by means of livestock breeding. The study of past socio-metabolic flows helps to highlight the two sides that have led to a lower energy performance of the agrarian systems in the 20th century: (1) the injection of external energy subsidies coming from fossil fuels; and (2) the functional disconnection between the different land covers inside the whole agrarian ecosystem. This disconnection has brought about a much more inefficient land use from an ecological point of view. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we analyze the consequences of mass and energy conservation and the second law of thermodynamics for economic activity. In contrast to former studies, we deduce our results formally from a general model of production and consumption. We show that in a static setting for economies containing irreversible processes, a non-zero resource input as well as non-zero emissions are necessary to sustain a positive level of consumption. We generalize this result to a dynamic setting and apply it to the growth discussion and the sustainability discourse. Thereby we show that limits to growth of production and consumption are likely to exist and that the concept of weak sustainability is either morally unattractive or physically infeasible.

AB The H2O2 supply strategy was one of crucial factors for high efficient degradation of pollutants with lignin peroxidase (LiP). In this paper, an attempt was made to couple a H2O2 producing enzymatic reaction to the LiP catalyzed oxidation of dyes. H2O2 needed was generated by glucose oxidase (GOD) and its substrate glucose. The generation rate of H2O2 could be easily controlled by adjusting the pH of the degradation system and the amount of GOD added. Due to the controlled release of H2O2, a sustainable constant activity of LiP was observed. The inhibition of LiP by high level H2O2 supplied externally by a single addition at the beginning of the experiments could be avoided. Degradation of three dyes (xylene cyanol, fuchsine and rhodamine B) with UP coupled with GOD indicated that the present H2O2 supply strategy was very effective for improvement of the efficiency of the decolourization of dyes.

AB Near-critical water (NCW) has drawn increasing attention as an environmentally benign medium for organic chemical reactions, especially acid/base catalysis without added acid or base. However, problems such as low reaction rates and poor selectivity exist for organic syntheses in NCW that greatly hinder the application of this attractive technique in industrially interesting processes. We have developed a novel solvent system to accelerate base-catalyzed reactions by the addition of NH3 to NCW. The reactions demonstrated include hydrolysis of cinnamaldehyde and aldol condensation of benzaldehyde with acetaldehyde. The reaction kinetics of the two reactions were determined. The effects of the NH3 concentration and temperature on the reactions were also investigated. The pOH of NH3-enriched NCW was estimated. The results demonstrate the feasibility of using NH3-enriched NCW as a sustainable reaction medium for the acceleration of base-catalyzed reactions.

AB In many developing countries, sustainable land management and water resources development are threatened by soil erosion and sediment-related problems. In response to such threats, there is an urgent need for improved catchment-based erosion control and sediment management strategies. The design and implementation of such strategies require data on erosion rates and understanding of the factors that control the delivery of sediment through the catchment system. In this study, reservoir sedimentation and corresponding catchment attribute data were used to investigate the major factors controlling sediment yield variability in a mountainous dryland region of nor-them Ethiopia. Sediment yield data were acquired for representative 11 catchments above reservoirs. Geomorphological and anthropogenic catchment attributes were extracted for each reservoir from different sources including digital elevation models, satellite images and field surveys. Different statistical analyses such as Pearson's correlation, principal components and multiple regression were implemented to analyze the relationship between sediment yield and catchment characteristics and to determine the major factors controlling the variability of sediment yield. The results show that terrain form, gully erosion, surface lithology, and land cover explain most of the variability in sediment yield among the catchments. The implications of the results, for relevant management intervention targeted at ameliorating the major causative factors of erosion, are also outlined. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Toxicity of Neatex (industrial detergent) and Norust CR 486 (corrosion
   inhibitors) to earthworms (Aporrectodea longa) in naturally spiked soil
SO AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BIOTECHNOLOGY

AB Ecological effects of indiscriminate disposal of industrial chemicals into soils of the Niger Delta environment of Nigeria were assessed using earthworms in spiked natural soil in the laboratory. Populations of indigenous epigeic adult earthworms, Aporrectodea longa, were exposed to varying concentrations of two chemicals (industrial detergent and corrosion inhibitor) in natural soil to determine the acute toxicity of the chemicals. Earthworm acute toxicity test (OECD) 207 method was employed. After two weeks of earthworm exposure to Neatex and Norust CR 486 concentrations of 62.5, 125, 250 and 500 mg/kg, percentage mortality was measured as the ecological endpoint in the earthworms. Based on OECD 2003 guidelines, the chemically spiked soil rating showed that both chemicals were slightly toxic. The estimated LC50 concentrations showed that Norust CR 486 (corrosion inhibitor) was more toxic than Neatex (detergent) at p < 0.05, t = 8.213. Earthworm mean mortality in both chemicals increased with increasing concentrations and exposure duration. Mean mortality observed in Neatex and Norust CR 486 were significantly different from the negative control suggesting that mortality may be attributed to the effect of the chemicals. The results obtained are therefore indications of early warning signs of future soil deteriorations occasioned by indiscriminate disposal of these chemicals in the Niger Delta environment. This calls for regular monitoring and sustainable effluent disposal management.

AB Data from the Farm Accountancy Data Network revealed that from 1989 to 2001 the average farm-gate N surplus of Flemish specialized dairy farms decreased from 378 to 238 kg N ha(-1), the corresponding whole-farm N efficiency increased from 15% to 22%. Study of European literature on dairy farming, of experimental farms or farm groups and of progressive Flemish farms showed that there is scope for further improvement of the N use efficiency in Flemish dairy farming. The improvement can mainly be realized by changes in the operational management, resulting in an ever decreasing use of fertilizer N and concentrate N. Reasonable targets for sustainable dairy farming in Flanders are 150 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) for the farm-gate N surplus and about 85 kg milk kg(-1) N surplus for eco-efficiency. These targets can be reached at production levels of up to 10,000 a 12,000 1 ha(-1) and at a satisfying income per unit of labour. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents a methodology for analyzing the effect of policies focused at reducing pollution from agriculture. Such a methodology must take into account that agricultural pollution is an effect of a large set of interacting processes, covers many different substances, and may vary substantially due to shifts in natural and economic conditions. Thus, the methodology must both cover the specificities of the different processes/disciplines involved and foster integration across these in a consistent way. The basic challenge is to cover the non-linear fine-scale variations at different levels of land-based production systems. Our methodology is founded on the idea of partitioning. It implies structuring and simplifying existing variation in space and time into partitions that are considered homogeneous. These partitions are organized in a hierarchy, and the different processes involved are modeled at the relevant level. We have concluded that analyses with fairly high level of resolution are preferable. This way it is also possible to combine a systems perspective with disciplinary integrity. A modeling structure - ECECNIOD (2.0) - based on the developed principles is documented. The paper also shows the ability of this structure to simulate choice of farming practices and emissions that are well in accordance with observations from four Norwegian regions with very different agricultural and natural conditions.

AB We use a simple ecological sustainability simulator (SESS) [Diaz-Solis, H., Kothmann, M.M., Hamilton, W.T., Grant.. W.E., 2003. A simple ecological sustainability simulator (SESS) for stocking rate management on semi-arid grazinglands, 76, 655] for rangelands with mean annual precipitation of 500 mm. to evaluate tendencies in range productivity and cattle production under four management options: (1) supplemental feeding, (2) short-term reduction of stocking rate, (3) early weaning, and (4) adjustment of breeding seasons. We have made five modifications to SESS for the present paper. (1) Cattle mortality now occurs each month as a function of body condition. (2) Cows that are not pregnant 2 months after the end of the breeding season are sold. (3) Forage intake is calculated separately for each cohort of cows. (4) Cows that have been sold or have died are replaced just before the beginning of each breeding season (except for the short-term reduction of stocking rate strategy). (5) The calculation of stocking rate now includes cows, bulls, nursing calves, weaned heifers less than 20 months of age, and pre-reproductive heifers aged 20 months or older.
   Simulation results suggest the four management options might be ranked from best to worst, in terms of increasing cattle production while maintaining range productivity, as: (1) short-term reduction of stocking rate, (2) adjustment of breeding seasons, (3) early weaning, and (4) supplementation. Short-term reduction of high stocking rates reduces the deterioration of range productivity because of the reduction in the number of stock. Adjustment of breeding seasons such that periods of highest energy requirements of cows and calves coincide with periods of highest forage production increases percentage pregnancy. Early weaning of calves improves the body condition of cows and increases annual production of weaned calves, but does not reduce the stocking rate and thus does not improve range productivity. Supplemental feeding, and other management practices that artificially sustain herbivores, break the negative feedback that promotes good range productivity and maintains long-term system stability. In general, strategies to increase cattle production in semi-arid rangelands should be based on the improvement of natural forage production. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A considerable literature addresses worker deskilling in manufacturing and the related loss of control over production processes experienced by farmers and others working in the agri-food industry. Much less attention has been directed at a parallel process of consumer deskilling in the food system, which has been no less important. Consumer deskilling in its various dimensions carries enormous consequences for the restructuring of agro-food systems and for consumer sovereignty, diets, and health. The prevalence of packaged, processed, and industrially transformed foodstuffs is often explained in terms of consumer preference for convenience. A closer look at the social construction of "consumers" reveals that the agro-food industry has waged a double disinformation campaign to manipulate and to re-educate consumers while appearing to respond to consumer demand. Many consumers have lost the knowledge necessary to make discerning decisions about the multiple dimensions of quality, including the contributions a well-chosen diet can make to health, planetary sustainability, and community economic development. They have also lost the skills needed to make use of basic commodities in a manner that allows them to eat a high quality diet while also eating lower on the food chain and on a lower budget. This process has a significant gender dimension, as it is the autonomy of those primarily responsible for purchasing and preparing foodstuffs that has been systematically undermined. Too often, food industry professionals and regulatory agencies have been accessories to this process by misdirecting attention to the less important dimensions of quality.

AB Sustainable land use planning involves both policy- and farmer-oriented agricultural land use strategies. In this paper, a spatially and temporally explicit multi-scale decision support system that reveals the biophysical indicators affecting land use choices of these different stakeholders, is explained and demonstrated. It comprises three different environmental assessment tools, designed to run with data supplied by traditional soil surveys and organised into a land resources information system. A qualitative land suitability classification procedure is adapted to translate the large-scale biophysical data supplied by a reconnaissance soil survey, into five suitability classes. At local scale, the productivity of the soil units identified during the semi-detailed soil survey is estimated using a three-level hierarchical crop productivity estimator, simulating the potential, water-limited and land production potential. At the smallest spatial and temporal resolution, a daily water balance approach is linked to a crop growth model, using daily climatic data recorded at different meteorological stations and the description, physical and chemical analyses of the soil profiles. The decision support system was applied and validated using the land resources information system of Rwanda. The system was capable to reveal the biophysical properties affecting crop regionalisation at national and local scale. Yield gaps between the potential, water-limited and land production potential, identified options for productivity optimisation such as irrigation or fertilisation. The crop growth model illustrated the delicate equilibrium between sowing date, crop cycle length and the length of the rainy seasons, limiting options for intensification. Combination of a multi-scale nature with scale-specific environmental assessment tools thus proved successful in identifying the different driving forces affecting land use choices made by different stakeholders involved, ranging from agricultural policy makers to individual farmers. This comprehensive approach is essential to realistic and sustainable land use planning. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The intrinsic value of soil to national, regional and local agroecological and economic productivity in sub-Saharan Africa is not adequately manifest in financial planning and decision making, challenging long-term sustainability as that resource degrades. While efforts to internalize the external costs of soil erosion in monetary units are available in the literature, we offer an alternative approach based on emergy synthesis, which enumerates the value of soil based on the environmental work required to produce it rather than based on surveys or derived pricing techniques. Emergy synthesis integrates all flows within a system of coupled economic and environmental work in common biophysical units (embodied solar energy or solar emjoules-sej), facilitating direct comparisons between natural and financial capital. Insight into long-term sustainability of human economic production and its basis in natural capital stocks is achieved via a suite of emergy-based indices. Our objective was to provide context for the magnitude of soil erosion losses within the larger resource basis of the Kenyan economy at three scales. Our results suggest that erosion losses at the national scale (4.5E21 sej/yr) are equal in magnitude to national electricity production or agricultural exports (equivalent to $ 390 million annually or 3.8% of GDP). This significant hidden, long-term cost is magnified in the selected district economies. In particular, in Nyando district (a densely populated rural district in western Kenya) we estimate that soil erosion represents over 14% of total emergy flows. The soil intensity of agriculture (SIA = agricultural yield/soil loss, both in emergy units) of Nyando (2.25) illustrates a severely marginalized agricultural sector in comparison with the nation as a whole (SIA = 7.56) or other nations (SIA(USA) = 81.9, SIA(Brazil) = 15.6). Soil loss measurements across land uses typical in western Kenya allowed emergy evaluation of differential costs and benefits; soil loss represented between 12 and 62% of total emergy use (subsistence agriculture SIA = 8.13, communal rangeland SIA = 1.62). By quantifying the ecological costs of soil erosion in units directly comparable with flows in other sectors of the economic system, we provide a baseline measure of sustainability against which appropriate investment (i.e., scaled to problem magnitude, targeted to hot-spots) in soil conservation may be evaluated.

AB Research studies aimed at integrating socio-economic and geo-bio-physical factors are increasingly being used in order to improve our understanding of the causes and effects of land-use change and to support sustainable landscape development. In line with such approaches, the study reported in this paper addresses land-use change and its drivers in the peripheral area of the Pyrenees National Park (PNP), France. The focus is land-use change on private farmland currently utilised by the farmers. The method relies on a Geographic Information System (GIS), including a digital terrain model, a digital cadastre map and a farm survey addressing current and past land use. For every parcel of land, data on current land-use practices and land-use histories since 1950 were collected during interviews with the farmers. An increase in land-use intensity occurred on some of the parcels in the late 1980s and 1990s, in contrast with the global processes of abandonment or extensification since the early 1960s. This intensification process appears to be related not only to the application of agri-environmental policies but also to specific local factors, in particular to the building of an access road to the highest part of the village. The respective roles of bio-physical factors (slope and elevation) and farm socio-economic factors (farmland spatial pattern, land-tenure system) on land-use change at parcel level have also been investigated. The impact of slope and elevation on land-use type appears overall to have been greater in 2003 than in 1950. However, these factors impact differently according to the types of landscape unit: they are not determining factors in the units remote from the village, but they do have an important role in the units close to the village. The distances of the parcels from the farmstead and their access facilities appear to be the two major farm-related factors in the local context. These results confirm the important role of land-management units' spatial arrangement in land-use dynamics and landscape change, as has already been found in other regions. They are seen as a valuable addition to studies aimed at supporting sustainable management of traditional mountain landscapes for multifunctional purposes. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Sustainability of poultry production using the emergy approach:
   Comparison of conventional and organic rearing systems

DE poultry production; organic fanning system; emergy
AB The organic production system is an important strategy, compatible with sustainable agriculture, avoiding the use of chemical compounds, limiting the intensity of production and providing controls along the entire chain of production. The aim of this study is to compare conventional and organic poultry production in terms of emergy analysis. The main differences in the two systems were the emergy cost for poultry feed and for cleaning/sanitization of the buildings between successive productive cycles. In both production systems the poultry feed represented more than 50% of the emergy flow. Regarding the agronomic phase, it was shown that almost all the organic crops, avoiding chemical fertilizers and pesticides, saved around 60% emergy. The emergetic costs for housing of the birds were very similar in both systems. Relating the emergy results with productive performance it is possible to show that, although the annual productive performance was much lower in organic than in conventional (-206%), transformity of organic poultry was around 10% lower. Comparison of the organic poultry system with a conventional one from the viewpoint of sustainability showed that all the emergy-based indicators are in favour of the organic farming system with a higher efficiency in transforming the available inputs in the final product, a higher level of renewable inputs, a higher level of local inputs and a lower density of energy and matter flows.

AB Sustainability has become an important discussion topic across the world since the late 1980s. However, there is still lack of knowledge about the landscape sustainability and its quantitative evaluation, especially at local and regional scale levels. The sustainable development of the Chinese Loess Plateau has always been a focus in China mainly because of the occurring severe soil erosion. This study investigates the changes of the landscape pattern and the changes of the ecological sustainability of the agricultural landscapes in Ansai County between 1980 and 2000, which is located in the northern part of the Chinese Loess Plateau. Using a landscape typology as a spatial reference framework, the concept of hemeroby was used, in a multidisciplinary approach, for the assessment of the ecological aspect of agricultural landscape sustainability. We combined expert judgement with a regression model and a Geographic Information System. Fourteen variables describing the landscape structure were chosen as predictors for hemeroby. The research showed that the major changes in the agricultural landscape pattern were caused not only by socio-economic factors but also by the government policies over the past two decades, such as the large-scale eco-environment conservation programmes starting in the late of the 20th century. One of these programmes is known as the Grain-for-Green Programme (initiated in 1999). Between 1980 and 2000, the proportion of cropland-dominated landscape sharply decreased while the percentage of the mixed farmland-grassland landscape and the mixed farmland-woodland-grassland landscape increased. Meanwhile, the ecological sustainability of the agricultural landscape as a whole tended to become more sustainable, except a few landscape types. Among variables describing landscape pattern, patch size standard deviation (PSSD), total edge (TE), mean shape index (MSI), landscape shape index (LSI) and Shannon's evenness index (SEI) were shown to be the significant predicators for hemeroby. Although some data limitation, landscape structure turned out to be a good predicator for land use intensity and ecological sustainability of agricultural landscape estimated by hemeroby. As a highly integrative indicator, the concept of hemeroby provides a framework for the comparison of different land use pattern. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We investigated age-related changes in biomass cycling and soil properties in a kayu putih (Melaleuca leucadendron LINN, Myrtaceae) with improved shifting cultivation system in East Java, Indonesia, to design better management plans for sustainable kayu putih oil production and crop yield. Harvested biomass of kayu putih increased markedly from 7- to 15-year-old stands, but did not increase further in older stands averaging 2.41 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1). Kayu putih contributed 1.9-31.0% of total biomass production. Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) tuber was the largest component of biomass cycling. Harvested biomass of cassava decreased with increasing stand age and there was a trade-off between above- and below-ground biomass productions. Harvested biomass of maize (Zea mays L.) grain was constant throughout stand growth, whereas returned biomass fluctuated. With increasing stand age, soil organic matter (SOM) accumulated in soil indicating that returned biomass was decomposing slowly. Content of primary nutrients did not change with stand age. The contribution of cassava to harvested biomass was considerably larger than that of kayu putih. For this reason, selection of cassava as a single companion crop may not be suitable for sustaining kayu putih oil production. Maize may be a good companion crop for kayu putih because it produces a constant grain yield throughout stand growth and its contribution to harvested biomass is comparable to that of kayu putih. In addition, maize is shallow-rooted and causes less below-ground competition with deep-rooted kayu putih trees.

ID SILVICULTURE
AB Historically, applied manipulative studies of forests have tested the ability of specific silvicultural treatments to address wood production objectives. Changing societal values now demand expanded approaches to forest management that also integrate social, ecological, and economic goals. As a result, many recent (past decade) experimental manipulations have become multi-disciplinary in scope and approach and involve restorative treatments, novel silvicultural approaches or variants of more traditional approaches that are relevant to operational scales. We examine a wide range of manipulative forest ecological experiments that have addressed a variety of responses to changes in forest structure or function. The silvicultural treatments employed in these experiments were often-times designed by interdisciplinary teams (e.g., forest ecologists, sociologists, biologists, economists, and silviculturists) with wood production and additional ecological, social or economic objectives as joint outcomes. Individually and collectively these studies represent major investments by research and land management organizations to meet increasing public demands for forests that provide healthy environments for people (clean air and water), support biological diversity (e.g., habitat), and sustain economic productivity (wood or other forest products and jobs).

ID SCOTTISH BLACKFACE LAMBS
AB Two selection indexes, one intended for lamb producers and finishers and one for store lamb producers, were derived using genetic parameters for carcass and maternal characteristics from Conington et al. (2001) and economic values from Conington et al. (2004). This paper summarizes responses to selection for lamb traits only, after 5 years of selection (1998 to 2003) on two farms using these selection indexes. The index for lamb producers and finishers, evaluated on farm 1, with a flock size of 680 ewes, includes economic weightings for maternal traits as well as carcass weight, fat and conformation grades, whereas the index for store lamb producers, evaluated on farm 2, with a flock size of 580 ewes, only includes economic values for maternal traits and lamb growth to weaning. Three selection lines of Scottish Blackface sheep per farm were created with the first lambs born to each line in 1999. These lines were selection (S), control (C) and industry (I); they were of equal size on each farm. Five top- and five average-performing ram lambs were selected each year for the S and C lines respectively using a multi-trait best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) implementation of the indexes. The I-line used four mature rams bought from industry, selected on appearance only, i.e. adherence to breed 'type'. Results showed that 5 years after the implementation of the index, the S line had significantly higher index scores than the C or I lines on both farms. The means (s.d.) for the average index scores in 2003 are 114 (328), 119 (371) and 451 (328) (farm 1), and -8 (146), -11 (130), and 250 (129) (farm 2) for the C, I and S lines, respectively, giving predicted net differences (S-C) of 3 pound center dot 38 (farm 1) and 2 pound center dot 58 (farm 2) per ewe. Phenotypic responses showed significant S v. C differences in weaning weight on both farms. As predicted from previous analyses, no changes in carcass quality traits were seen at farm 1 although S-line carcass weights tended to be heavier than those from the C or I lines. The results show that genetic improvement using multi-trait selection indices has been successful and it is a viable, long-term strategy to improve levels of production for hill sheep in extensive environments.

AB In this paper, we analyze the relationship between the characteristics of transportation energy consumption and urban form elements that were actively argued along with Environmentally Sound and Sustainable Development (ESSD). This paper can be divided into two parts: an examination of the theories and a practical analysis of domestic, small-, and medium-sized cities. Firstly, in the examination of theories, we surveyed the arguments about the sustainable urban form. Secondly, we made some hypotheses about the relationships between transportation energy consumption, city size, density, and center distribution pattern. Thirdly, we tested those hypotheses and examined the suitability of policies for each alternative for small- and medium-sized cities in Korea. The main themes in this paper are as follows. Firstly, how does the city size, density, etc. affect the transportation energy consumption? Secondly, in an overcrowded Korean situation, which alternative is the more suitable sustainable urban form from the point of transportation energy consumption, i.e., concentration or decentralized concentration? Thirdly, we examined the argument that a densely centralized development can reduce the need for travel, increase the transit use, and decrease automobile use. From the results of the analysis, we found that as the population increases, transportation energy represented by yearly gasoline consumption per automobile and the average yearly energy consumption as a result of surface transportation per 1,000 persons tends to decrease. Further, if the degree of city's concentration represented by Gini coefficient is high, energy efficiency tends to decrease. Besides, the influential factors on the transportation energy consumption among the indicators of urban form could be road ratio and density. Whereas the road ratio is not related to the transportation energy consumption, road density is. From the analyzed results, we can deduce planning implications concerned with Korean cities. Firstly, Korean cities are already highly centralized so a decentralization policy should be carried out to increase transportation energy efficiency. In any case, in the case of high-density cities, multinuclei cities are better than mononuclear ones. Further, to increase the transportation energy efficiency, policies for high road densities through the construction of new roads in spite of narrow road widths are more effective than those for high road ratio-widening existing roads.

TI Potential of a 16S rRNA-based taxonomic microarray for analyzing the

AB Bacterial diversity is central to ecosystem sustainability and soil biological function, for which the role of roots is important. The high-throughput analysis potential of taxonomic microarray should match the breadth of bacterial diversity. Here, the power of this technology was evidenced through methodological verifications and analysis of maize rbizosphere effect based on a 16S rRNA-based microarray developed from the prototype of H. Sanguin et al. (Environ. Microbiol. 8:289-307, 2006). The current probe set was composed of 170 probes (41 new probes in this work) that targeted essentially the Proteobacteria. Cloning and sequencing of 16S rRNA amplicons were carried out on maize rhizosphere and bulk soil DNA. All tested clones that had a perfect match with corresponding probes were positive in the hybridization experiment. The hierarchically nested probes were reliable, but the level of taxonomic identification was variable, depending on the probe set specificity. The comparison of experimental and theoretical hybridizations revealed 0.91% false positives and 0.81% false negatives. The microarray detection threshold was estimated at 0.03% of a given DNA type based on DNA spiking experiments. A comparison of the maize rhizosphere and bulk soil hybridization results showed a significant rhizosphere effect, with a higher predominance of Agrobacterium spp. in the rhizosphere, as well as a lower prevalence of Acidobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Verrucomicrobia, and Planctomycetes, a new taxon of interest in soil. In addition, well-known taxonomic groups such as Sphingomonas spp., Rhizobiaceae, and Actinobacteria were identified in both microbial habitats with strong hybridization signals. The taxonomic microarray developed in the present study was able to discriminate and characterize bacterial community composition in related biological samples, offering extensive possibilities for systematic exploration of bacterial diversity in ecosystems.

AB In this paper, we incorporate intelligence into Kolmogorov's ecological system, that is, we propose a fuzzy system to combine heuristic rules into the design of nonlinear adaptive controller, where the heuristic rules are in the form of fuzzy IF-THEN rules. By using Lyapunov synthesis approach, we attain an adaptive law adjusting the free parameters in the controller such that the closed-loop system follows a desired trajectory. Although there exist uncertainty and chaos in Komogorov's model, application shows that an adaptive fuzzy control is a powerful tool to pursuit sustainable development of ecology.

TI Genetic diversity of rhizobia associated with common bean (Phaseolus

AB Brazil is the largest producer and consumer of the common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), but yields are often low and may be improved by a higher N supply through symbiosis with rhizobia. One main limitation to the N-2-fixation process is the susceptibility of the symbiosis to environmental stresses frequent in the tropics, such as high soil temperatures and low soil moisture contents. Among other benefits, the no-tillage (NT) system reduces those stresses resulting in higher N, fixation rates and yields; however, the effects of NT on rhizobial diversity are poorly understood. This study evaluated the diversity of rhizobia compatible with common bean in cropping areas under the NT or the conventional tillage (CT) systems in Ponta Grossa, State of Parana, Southern Brazil. Genetic diversity was assessed by DNA analyses using the methodologies of BOX-PCR and RFLP-PCR of the 16S rDNA region. A high level of diversity was observed among the strains and the DNA profiles from the CT system were quite different from those from the NT system. Twenty-three RFLP-PCR profiles were obtained, indicating that many tropical rhizobial species remain to be described. Strain differentiation was achieved in the BOX-PCR analysis; diversity was slightly higher under the NT when compared with the CT system. Surprisingly, the rhizobial grouping based on cluster analysis of the RFLP-PCR of the 16S rDNA region indicated a higher diversity of species under the CT. It could be that the environmental stability offered by the NT system has led to a decrease in the number of species, with the predominance of the most successful ones, although genetic diversity within each species has increased. The results obtained in this study show that we still understand poorly the relation between microbial diversity and soil sustainability and that the complexity of the ecosystems require the evaluation of several parameters to define and monitor soil quality.

AB A shortage of marine raw ingredients, such as fish oil, is predicted in the near future. The use of suitable alternative lipid sources, such as vegetable oils, is crucial for sustainable growth of the aquaculture sector. Three isonitrogenous (50% Crude Protein) and isoenergetic (19 kJ g(-1)) diets, in which fish oil was gradually replaced by soybean oil (0, 25 and 50% of the oil fraction) were tested for 12 weeks, using European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) juveniles. No dietary effects (p > 0.05) on growth performance, feed conversion, digestibility or body composition were observed with either species. The results obtained suggest the inclusion of soybean oil up to 50% of the dietary lipid is possible, in diets for sea bass and/or rainbow trout juveniles.

AB We present a deterministic model that specifies lane direction in a multi-laned bridge that has a movable barrier that divides the two directions of traffic flow, in order to reduce congestion. A probabilistic dynamic programming formulation for a stochastic extension of the model is also presented. Analysis of the special structure of the dynamic programming formulation provides new insights into important aspects of certain traffic planning problems and represents a useful addition to the traffic network planner's toolkit. A case study involving the lane direction management of an actual bridge is also provided.

TI Switzerland: Current energy and climate policies - Political boundary

SO ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER
LA German
DT Article
AB End use energy consumption in Switzerland has increased almost ninefold over the past 95 years, amounting to nearly 88 PJ in 2004. This figure breaks down as follows: coal 5%, oil-based fuels 29%, motor fuels 31%, electricity 22%, gas 11%, district heat, solid municipal and industrial waste as well as renewables (excluding electricity) approx. 1%. In 2004 alone, end use energy consumption rose by half a percent, thus reaching a new record high. This development is due, above all, to the population increase and to economic growth. To achieve its goals in energy and climate policies, and to initiate sustainable energy supply, the Swiss federal council in 2001 launched the "EnergySwitzerland" Program. The new strategy of the Program focuses on these three goals: "Climate," "Electricity: Efficiency Goal," and "Renewable Energies."
   On the basis of perspectives of the development of the population and of the economy, the consequences of a number of policy variants for energy supply and demand and for the economy and the environment have been examined. Four scenarios (variants) are to help design energy policy on a medium and long term by showing energy policy options.
   For the area of electricity supply facing increasing requirement, 4 options and their pros and cons are distinguished: electricity, imports, renewable energies, fossil-fired thermal plants (combined-cycle plants), and nuclear power.
   With a 40% share in domestic production, nuclear power continues to be a pillar of Swiss energy supply. The fundamental question about the future of nuclear power is not a question of technical or economic know-how, but a question of the system of political values.
   As the current legal system in the field of electricity supply does not meet requirements, it will have to be adapted.

TI Rural adjustment schemes: Juggling politics, welfare and markets
SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION
LA English
DT Article
ID POLICY
AB The Commonwealth government has offered support to farmers in the form of structural or business adjustment-type schemes since the Loan (Farmers Debt Adjustment) Acts of 1935-1971. Since 1971, a series of more comprehensive rural reconstruction/adjustment schemes with a range of objectives from debt alleviation to encouraging some exits from agricultural industries, has been in place. While having little direct impact on the structure of these industries, the various schemes have been politically important and an indicator of how core values relating to agricultural production and rural life have changed. A review of the schemes shows an increasing focus on improving farm productivity and sustainability, accompanied by a discourse emphasising the need to promote the 'farm business', rather than to protect the 'family farm'. On the other hand, governments have also used these schemes to deliver 'welfare' outputs.

TI Local heroes? Learning from recent community strengthening initiatives
   in Victoria
SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Policies and programs which aim to strength the engagement, connectedness and resilience of local communities have increasingly become a core element in public policy responses to the challenges posed by globalising social and economic relations. However, for many politicians, policy makers and citizens the conceptual framework and practical benefits of 'community strengthening' remain vague and unclear. This article aims to contribute to debates about the significance of community strengthening by providing a concise overview of the development and implementation of community strengthening initiatives by the Bracks Labor government in Victoria. Initial learning from this experience suggests that engaging and linking local communities can make a useful contribution to local social, environmental and economic outcomes as well as providing a foundation for the democratic renewal of local governance. Key factors underpinning successful community strengthening programs include strong local ownership and leadership, backed by sustained government investment in the social and physical infrastructure priorities identified as important by local communities. However, while local community strengthening strategies can lead to real improvements in community networks, infrastructure and capacity they are no substitute for the inclusive and redistributive taxation, income security, service delivery and labour market policies needed to create the conditions for sustainable reductions in poverty, inequality and social exclusion.

DE extinction risk; environmental information; sustainability
AB Predicting and redressing the threat of species extinction is not a success story. The science of estimating extinction rates and risk prediction is approached in a manner that is difficult to apply in the field, and yet current integrated ecosystem management programmes in many parts of the world, which are trying to place the conservation of species into sustainable community projects, need predictive tools for planning land use programmes. Such programmes involve US$100s of millions of multilateral and bilateral aid; many predicated on a site's biodiversity importance, the risks of extinction, sustainable extraction, production forms of land use, community livelihoods, water, and many others factors, but increasingly on ensuring that after the pump-priming funds are finished the programmes are both environmentally and economically sustainable (Swingland 2002, 2003, 2004; Swingland et al. 2003). [Swingland I. R. 2002. In: Swingland I. R., Bettelheim E. C., Grace J., Prance G. T. and Saunders L. S. (eds), Carbon Biodiversity, Conservation and Income: An Analysis of a Free Market Approach to Land-use Change and Forestry in Developing and Developed Countries.

In: Swingland I. R. (ed.), Capturing Biodiversity and Conserving Biodiversity: The Market Approach. Earthscan, London] This involves predictions of 'what if?' what if laws are changed to prevent over utilisation and prevent' The Tragedy of the Commons' where land ownership is vested in the state and people degrade the environment, and instead institute private land ownership. In places like China and much of the Far East, biodiversity is over-exploited as nearly all their species are used for food, medicine and construction purposes, and private land ownership in rural areas is rudimentary or absent. Since most species extinction is anthropocentric, research on species extinction needs to be more accessible and focussed on global problems.

AB The work reported here addresses two primary questions: (1) How much "moss'' (a mixture of mosses and liverworts) is harvested commercially from forests in the Pacific Northwest (PNW) and Appalachian regions of the U.S.? (2) What is the commercial value of this nontimber forest product? Methods included surveying land managers, botanists and moss dealers, querying U. S. government databases, and interviewing people involved in the moss trade. Approximately 35% of land manager respondents issued permits for moss harvest in the last five years. These reported that permits were issued for an average of 4,009 (Appalachian) and 96,433 (PNW) air-dry kg/yr of moss over the years 1997-2002, with a maximum reported permitted harvest of 166,793 air-dry kg across both regions in the year 2000. Official U. S. Forest Service sources listed the maximum yearly reported harvest for these regions as 115,661 air-dry kg in 2000 (PNW 71,534 kg and Appalachians 44,127 kg) and official Bureau of Land Management sources for OR and WA listed the maximum permitted harvest as 54,978 air-dry kg in 2001. Yearly revenues from sales of commercial moss harvest permits were reported to be <= US$19,650. In contrast, estimates of total harvests based on export data and assumptions about those data suggest that the mean yearly harvest for the years 1998-2003 was between 4.6 and 18.4 million air-dry kg ( yearly minimum and maximum estimated at 0.9 and 37.4 million air-dry kg, respectively). Moss sales (domestic plus exports) are estimated to total between US$; 6 million and 165 million per year. The wide ranges in these estimates illustrate how little is known about the moss harvest trade. In combination with lack of information about the size of the moss inventory, reaccumulation rates, and species and ecosystem functions potentially affected by harvest, results indicate that policy makers and land managers lack critical information on which to base harvest regulations.

TI Cartographic ideals and geopolitical realities: international maps of
   the world from the 1890s to the present
SO CANADIAN GEOGRAPHER-GEOGRAPHE CANADIEN
LA English
DT Article
ID ROYAL-GEOGRAPHICAL-SOCIETY; WAR
AB This paper charts the attempts to construct an international map of the world using a standard projection and common conventions and symbols. The first part of the paper discusses the original incarnation of this idea, the International (1:1 Million) Map of the World (IMW), initially proposed by the German geographer Albrecht Penck in the early 1890s. The IMW was designed to challenge the idea that cartography was an inherently national science undertaken by, and for, specific nation states. Despite endless negotiations, delays and compromises, two world wars and the withdrawal of American support, the IMW project continued through the early and middle decades of the twentieth century, initially at the British Ordnance Survey and subsequently at the United Nations, only to fizzle out in the 1970s. The second part of the paper examines the Global Mapping Project (GMP), the latest manifestation of the same idea. Global Map, the first version of which was released in 2000, is an attempt to construct a single world map for the digital age. Like the IMW before it, Global Map is designed to facilitate a common, trans-national understanding of global problems. However, the technical, institutional and application challenges facing the CMP are different from those that confronted the IMW. Whereas the primary purpose of the IMW was never consistently defined, Global Map has a clearer environmental and educational objective. But if Global Map is to become an effective tool for sustainable environmental management and development, its advocates will need to learn the lessons of the IMWs failure and secure renewed international commitment to the value of international mapping.

TI Evaluating willingness-to-pay for bison attributes: An experimental

ID GENETICALLY-MODIFIED FOODS; CONSUMERS; TRACEABILITY; PRODUCTS; MARKETS;

AB Domestic bison herds in Canada and the United States have grown rapidly over the past decade. For this growth to be sustainable, viable markets for bison meat products are necessary. Bison products are available at the retail level to only a limited extent in some localized markets. Very little is known about consumer preferences for bison in Canada. A consumer research study was conducted across five Canadian locations. An experimental auction was used to evaluate willingness-to-pay (WTP) for bison versus beef, plus the marginal WTP for bison with additional health-related attributes. Bison products verified to be lower in fat than beef, and bison verified to have been produced without the use of growth hormones were evaluated. Results suggest that there was no significant WTP for bison over beef, either with or without the additional quality assurances. Delivering a positive eating experience to consumers was more important than the health-related attributes per se. Distinct market segments with significantly different WTP for bison are identified. Some regional differences are also apparent. The industry cannot rely solely on the touted health benefits of bison to deliver a competitive advantage over beef. While some consumers may be willing to pay more for these health-related attributes, consumers in general are unlikely to compromise eating experience.

AB This paper discusses the basic concepts involved in infrastructure, durability, and sustainability. At present, infrastructure facilities are designed and constructed on the basis of direct costs only, without explicit consideration of maintenance and depreciation over its service life as in other industries. Proper design, operation, and management of infrastructure must deal with every facet of its service life, ranging from conception, feasibility studies, design, construction, operation, maintenance, repair and rehabilitation, and finally decommissioning and disposal of the system after it has outlived its useful life. Every step of these considerations must be guided by overall socioeconomic and environmental concerns; in summary, they must be guided by the principles of sustainable development, which embrace the issue of embodied energy in the materials, construction, and both initial and recurring maintenance. The degradation of the performance of Canada's infrastructure over the past few decades is reviewed, along with the consequences of proper or deferred maintenance and their impact on Canada's infrastructure deficit. The roles of the civil engineering profession, including education and training, and those of the public and private sectors are discussed briefly.

AB The life cycle performance of any infrastructure should be taken into consideration in its design, its construction, its maintenance, its operation, and when needed, its rehabilitation. The protection of infrastructure must be holistic, taking into account long-term socioeconomic and environmental considerations and the impact of the global climate change. Fulfilling the requirements of the ultimate and serviceability limit states over the service life of the facility requires an understanding of the use of the system, the deterioration response of the materials and their components when subjected to aggressive environments, and how this deterioration can be prevented or significantly delayed by preventive, remedial, and routine maintenance. The composition, microstructure, macrostructure, and various modes of deterioration of materials used in construction (steel, wood, concrete) are reviewed, along with possible remedial measures. The development of concrete as a construction material, its durability, and the relevant durability provisions in the various Canadian Standards Association standards are reviewed briefly. Current European practice and the 1990 Comite Euro-International du beton Design Guide for Durable Concrete Structures are evaluated. The engineer's responsibility for durable performance of a facility and the importance of durability audits are also examined.

AB Community interactions alter the management actions necessary to recover overfished species using marine reserves. For example, in communities where a larger species preys on their juveniles' competitors, overfishing of the larger species may cause prey population expansion; subsequent increased competition for the juveniles of the over fished species may impede its recovery within reserves. We explore the implications of such community interactions for reserve design with a model of a subtidal rockfish (genus Sebastes) system from the Northeast Pacific Ocean within a no-take reserve. Ignoring community interactions, the model predicts that a reserve large enough for internal recruitment to counterbalance mortality will allow recovery of the overfished species. However, after incorporating community interactions, the model predicts that two alternative stable states exist: one where the overfished species dominates and one where the prey dominates. In the community model, the ability of an overfished system to recover to the equilibrium where the overfished species dominates after reserve establishment depends on the initial densities of both species, and a larger reserve is required for recovery to be possible.

AB Recent policy commitments aim to reduce biodiversity loss and integrate environmental concerns into fisheries management. However, there are few operational indicators for reporting biodiversity trends and judging progress in relation to management objectives. Here we develop a threat indicator based on the population status of a suite of 23 North Sea fishes from 1982 to 2001 estimated using World Conservation Union (IUCN) Red List decline criteria. The composite indicator was calculated from the weighted average of the threat scores of individual species in each year and varies from 0 to 3, where a score of 3 is equivalent to each species qualifying as "critically endangered". The proportion of threatened fishes, their degree of threat, and the composite indicator value increased steadily over time. The composite indicator value has been > 1 since the late 1990s, equivalent to all species meeting the "vulnerable" criterion. A suitable reference trajectory, consistent with the World Summit on Sustainable Development commitment to "achieve by 2010 a significant reduction of the current rate of biodiversity loss" would be a significant reduction in the rate of increase in this indicator before 2010, a limit reference point could be 1 (all species vulnerable) and a target reference point could be 0 (no threatened species).

AB Single-tree selection has been employed widely in northern Japanese mixed forests, but management-induced changes in forests are not well understood. This study examined demographic parameters of major tree species during a 20-year study of a 68 ha stand in which single-tree selection has been conducted since 1971. Results showed that growth and survival of conifers (mostly Abies sachalinensis (Fr. Schm.) Masters) was the most strongly positively affected by the treatment. Nevertheless, recruitment of conifers was not sufficiently improved, suggesting their decreased dominance over the longer term. Instead, shade-intolerant broad-leaved species (mainly Betula ermanii Cham.) will gradually increase because of their higher recruitment rates after the treatment. Shade-tolerant broad-leaved species (mainly Acer mono Maxim. and Tilia japonica (Miq.) Simonkai) appeared to experience the most distinct negative effects, especially on survival. These trends differed markedly from those reported in previous papers concerning partial harvesting systems, which predicted an increase in dominance of shade-tolerant species. The results shown here should be generalized carefully because we have investigated only one stand without repetition of the control area. Nevertheless, trends described in this large-scale, long-term study could provide a basis for simulating stand dynamics. We discussed possible reasons for the observed patterns and provided implications for sustainable management in the region.

ID DECISION-SUPPORT FRAMEWORK
AB Designing more sustainable processes is one of the key challenges for sustainable development of the chemical industry. This is by no means a trivial task as it requires translating the theoretical principles of sustainable development into design practice. At present, there is no general methodology to guide sustainable process design and almost no practical experience. In an attempt to contribute to this emerging area, this paper proposes a new methodology for integrating sustainability considerations into process design. Underpinned by life cycle thinking, the methodology guides the process designer through different design stages to enable integration of technical, economic, environmental and social criteria. The approach is illustrated on a design case study of the vinyl chloride monomer process. The case study shows how to identify relevant sustainability criteria, how to assess the level of sustainability and how to use the obtained information to make the design more sustainable.

AB In this study the effects of different levels of industrial wastes on growth traits and metal accumulation in aerial portions were determined for Populus X euramericana clone I-214. The experiment started in April 2003. Scions of Populus x euramericana clone I-214, were grown outdoor near Pisa (Italy), in lisimeters filled with soil naturally present in the land around the experimental site, were daily drip irrigated, hand weeded, monthly fertilized, pruned for a unique shoot and cultivated with four increasing treatments: soil non-amended, soil amended with 4.8 kg m(-2), with 9.6 kg m(-2) and with 19.2 kg m(-2) of fresh tannery waste. The climatic parameters were daily recorded throughout the whole experiment. Growth relieves were performed during the growing season. After six months since the plantation of the scions, aerial portions of every plant were harvested for biomass and metal content analyses. Data demonstrated that the waste exerted beneficial effects on poplars mainly through a general increase of growth traits and that the nutrients relocation is the mechanisms involved in modulating growth rate. The concentration and the amount of the mineral elements analysed (N, P, K, Na, Ca, Mg, S, B, Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, Cr) changed determinately among treatments, organs and position. We concluded that phytoremediation strategies of tannery wastes might be possible and sustainable for polar plantations in soil amended with non-hazardous levels of industrial waste, which maintain total heavy metals concentration close to background values.

AB The Tarim Desert Highway shelterbelt, located in hinterland of Taklimakan Desert, is irrigated by underground saline water, with three to thirty gram per litter mineral degrees. The sustainability and stability are affected by multifarious stress. The structural and functional characteristics of shelterbelt are studied to probe into correlation between environment and shelterbelt. On basis, decision analysis is applied to study ecological stability of the Tarim Desert Highway shelterbelt, to screen out limited factors, to establish general index system, and to evaluate the stability of the shelterbelt nowadays. Finally, the concept of ecological stability is utilized to manage the artificial ecosystem. The results show that the artificial ecosystem is relatively flimsy, whose stability can be increased by adjusting stand structure and improving the nutrient cycle.

ID ECOSYSTEM SERVICES
AB Ecological capital assessment is currently one of the important research contents in the interdisciplinary field of ecology, resources economics, environmental economics and ecological economics. To scientifically assess ecological capital redounds to decision-makers to consider the ecological cost in economic development, and is also necessary for sustainable economic development in and areas. Based on the theory of landscape ecology, in this paper the per unit area ecological capital values in arid areas are researched by using the Landsat TM data, CBERS satellite data, meteorological data, MODIS satellite data and other ecological data, and the RS- and GIS-based models of assessing ecological capital values in and areas are developed. Moreover, based on the field-measured data, a case study on ecological capital assessment in the Manas River basin, Xinjiang in 2003 is carried out. The basin is divided into 4 ecological capital areas so as to quantitatively calculate the ecological capital values of the ecosystems, analyze the spatial distribution of ecological capital, and chart the maps of spatial distribution of ecological capital. The results show that the total ecological capital value of the ecosystems in the Manas River basin in 2003 was 1.494 54x10(11) yuan RMB. In spatial distribution, the ecological capital decreases from the alpine zones to the plains and from the oases to the deserts, which accords with the distribution of vegetation zonality in this and area. The assessed results can objectively reflect the ecological capital and its spatial distribution in the and basin, and can also provide reference for roundly carrying out the assessment of ecological capital in and areas.

ID SUSTAINABILITY; GIS
AB Both advocacy and performance measurement ends of the city planning spectrum have advanced the approach of measuring and monitoring urban indicators as a practical means to lofty planning goals. Urban and regional indicator projects aim to generate synergistic utility out of measures of urban quality and progress, trying to transform assessment measures into strategic levers for system change. This article reports on the theory, methods and design of an action research project that has taken place since late 2004, the Regional Vancouver Urban Observatory (RVu). RVu is the first member of the UN-Habitat Global Urban Observatory network to be established in a developed country. RVu conceptualized and completed overlapping processes in generating both expert-based and citizen-based recommendations on key regional indicators, with a view toward sustainable development. Our hypothesis has been that negotiation and integration of values and ideals will occur throughout such a process and common indicators will emerge that approach a new sustainable view of the region.

AB The concept of sustainability typically encompasses social, economic, political and environmental components. This paper focuses on the measurement of factors that help predict whether a region is moving toward or away from environmentally sustainable paths. Examples of natural capital are provided along with the rationales for using a natural capital approach. Indicators assist in the assessment of conditions and trends, facilitate informed discussion among diverse groups within the community, provide input into the policy process, and help communities identify important tradeoffs they may face in all sorts of decisions that affect sustainability, including land use, transportation infrastructure and fiscal policies.

ID INDICATORS
AB Aboriginal and Indigenous people are among the world's poorest of the poor, and are forming increasing proportions of urban centres throughout the world. Little information is currently gathered on urban Aboriginal and Indigenous populations, and almost no systems exist that examine their quality of life or importance to urban sustainability. An indicators system was developed by the Centre for Native Policy and Research to examine the condition of the Greater Vancouver region's 36,000 Aboriginal people. The system was based on the traditional Aboriginal concept of the medicine wheel and incorporates four elements or directions (physical/economic, spiritual/cultural, emotional/social, and mental/environment) as the foundation of sustainability. Information for the indicators revealed a much lower quality of life for Aboriginal people in the Greater Vancouver region compared to other residents. Only 36% of the indicators ranked as fair or improving, while 60% ranked as deteriorating, weak, or poor. In order to improve our understanding of progress towards sustainability, Aboriginal and Indigenous people need to be involved in developing and defining measures of sustainability. Such measures should take into account the significant cultural heritage and importance of Aboriginal and Indigenous people, and the significant socioeconomic gaps that exist.

AB The article examines the relationship between NGOs and the general public in Serbia, Bosnia & Herzegovina, and Macedonia. This relationship is often perceived as troubled. Focus group findings, however, suggest that ordinary people's attitudes towards local NGOs are rather more nuanced and that quite a few people would like to join an NGO themselves, if given an opportunity. NGOs should therefore make more effort to tap into this potential, by providing more and better information about their activities available to the general public and by being more inclusive, thus enhancing both NGO legitimacy and future sustainability in the region.

AB Long-term (> 50 years) extinction patterns and processes in isolated tropical forest Patches are poorly understood. Considering that forest fragments are rapidly becoming the common feature of most tropical landscapes, data on the long-term conservation value of such fragments are urgently needed. We report on avifaunal turnover in a tropical woodlot (Bogor Botanical Gardens; 86 ha; 54% native and 46% introduced plants; mean 83,649 visitors/month) that has been surveyed several times before and after its isolation in 1936 By 2004 the original avifaunal richness of this woodlot declined by 59% (97 to 40 species) and its forest-dependent avifauna declined by 60% (30 to 12 species). Large-bodied birds were particularly prone to extinction before 1987, but following this time none of the species traits we studied could be considered predictive of extinction proneness. All seven forest-dependent bird species that attempted to colonize this woodlot by 1987 perished thereafter Our results show that area reduction, isolation, intense human use, and perverse management (e.g., understory removal) of this patch have probably negatively affected the long-term sustainability of its forest avifauna.

AB Marine protected areas, and other fishery management systems that impart partial or total protection from fishing, are increasingly advocated as an essential management tool to ensure the sustainable use of marine resources. Beneficial effects for fish species are well documented for tropical and reef systems, but the effects of marine protected areas remain largely untested in temperate waters. We compared trends in sport-fishing catches of nine fish species in an area influenced by a large (500-km(2)) towed fishing-gear restriction zone and in adjacent areas under conventional fishery management controls. Over the period 1973-2002 the mean reported weight of above-average-sized (trophy) fish of species with early age at maturity and limited home range was greatest within the area influenced by the fishing-gear restriction zone. The reported weight of trophy fish of species that mature early also declined less and more slowly over time within the area influenced by the fishing-gear restriction zone. Importantly, the mean reported weight of trophy fish of species that mature late and those that undertake extensive spatial movements declined at the same rate in all areas, Hence these species are likely to require protected areas > 500 km(2) for effective protection. Our results also indicated that fish species with a localized distribution or high site fidelity may require additional protection from sport fishing to prevent declines in the number or size of fish within the local population.

SO CONSERVATION BIOLOGY

DT Article
DE deforestation rate; global development data; human development index;
   regional development patterns; sustainable development
AB Human population and development activities affect the rate of deforestation in biodiversity hotspots. We quantified the effect of human population growth and development on rates of deforestation and analyzed the relationship between these causal factors in the 1980s and 1990s. We compared the averages of population growth, human development index (HDI, which measures income, health, and education), and deforestation rate and computed correlations among these variables for countries that contain biodiversity hotspots. When population growth was high and HDI was low there was a high rate of deforestation, but when HDI was high, rate of deforestation was low, despite high population growth. The correlation among variables was significant for the 1990s but not for the 1980s. The relationship between population growth and HDI bad a regional pattern that reflected the historical process of development Based on the changes in HDI and deforestation rate over time, we identified two drivers of deforestation: policy choice and human-development constraints. Policy choices that disregard conservation may cause the loss of forests even in countries that are relatively developed. Lack of development in other countries, on the other band, may increase the pressure on forests to meet the basic needs of the human population. Deforestation resulting from policy choices may be easier to fix than deforestation arising from human development constraints. To Prevent deforestation in the countries that have such constraints, transfer of material and intellectual resources from developed countries may be needed. Popular interest in sustainable development in developed countries can facilitate the transfer of these resources.

AB The results of the department of Pastures and Forages at the Institute of Animal Science are indicated and related to the assessment of indicators to determine the effect of livestock production on the stability and sustainability of the system soil-pasture-animal. The main indicators were selected and there is a proposal of tables with value ranges for their interpretation. The utilization of these methodologies helps to determine the stability of the system, soil-plant on the grassland ecosystems, as well as to work with a reduced number of indicators being a useful tool for fanners and researchers.

TI Post-December 2004 tsunami reconstruction in Sri Lanka and its potential
   impacts on future vulnerability
SO EARTHQUAKE SPECTRA
LA English
DT Article
AB The 26 December 2004 tsunami displaced more than 500,000 people and killed an estimated 31,000 in Sri Lanka. Damage was not uniform, often reflecting distinct patterns of social, infrastructural, and ecological vulnerability. Severely affected populations tended to be poorer, to live in fragile structures, and to be more exposed to the tsunami as a result of prior environmental degradation in the coastal zone. The massive reconstruction effort may further decrease the resilience of rural communities by degrading the natural environment that sustains their livelihoods. A sustainable reconstruction approach must therefore consider long-term solutions that increase community resilience by fostering socioeconomic, infrastructural, and environmental progress. A reconnaissance team monitored the initial recovery stages and identified mechanisms in supporting research on reducing the long-term vulnerability of human settlements and ecosystems to future environmental hazards.

TI Inter-specific competition from fallow deer Dama dama reduces habitat
   quality for the Italian roe deer Capreolus capreolus italicus
SO ECOGRAPHY
LA English
DT Article

   POPULATIONS; SELECTION; DYNAMICS; FOREST; RED
AB The roe deer of Mediterranean habitats in the central and southern parts of Italy has recently been recognised as a distinct subspecies, Capreolus capreolus italicus. A population of this endangered subspecies has been monitored in the Preserve of Castelporziano, near Rome, since 1988. We observed an abrupt population decline in 2000, which may severely threaten the sustainability of this population. We evaluated the hypothesis that competition by fallow deer may be a principal cause of this decline. By a new and innovative methodology, we modelled the spatial distribution of fallow deer density (FDD) in the study area to show that 1) habitat quality for roe deer was an inverse function of FDD, 2) habitat apportionment between fallow and roe deer increased as a function of FDD and - by applying structural equation modelling - 3) FDD was superior to habitat composition in explaining observed variations in home range size and probably in habitat quality for roe deer. This analysis is the first to document that inter-specific competition may influence the spatial behaviour of a deer species leading to poor phenotypic performance in the inferior competitor. We conclude that the conservation of this relict population would benefit by reducing fallow deer numbers at Castelporziano and from other measures aimed to decrease the level of inter-specific competition.

AB Ecologists often point to excessive truncation of a population's size-structure as a deleterious effect of exploitation, yet the effect of this truncation on population persistence is seldom quantified. While persistence of marine populations requires maintenance of a sufficient level of lifetime reproduction, fishing reduces lifetime reproduction by increasing the total mortality rate, preventing individuals from growing old, large, and highly fecund. We employ a new method of estimating changes in lifetime egg production (LEP) using two samples of the size structure, one in the past and one current, to assess persistence of five species of nearshore rockfish (Sebastes spp.) in California and Oregon, USA. Using length frequency data from catch in the recreational fishery, we estimate that since 1980, four of the five rockfish species considered have experienced declines in LEP to levels that suggest that persistence is impaired. When changes in LEP were estimated for subsets of the data corresponding to neighboring geographical regions, differences in LEP levels were apparent in the neighboring regions, implying that the effects of fishing mortality are not evenly distributed over space. We conclude by discussing the use of this estimation approach to assess the status of other species in data-poor situations.

ID BAYESIAN DECISION-ANALYSIS; RECRUITMENT; LIKELIHOOD
AB With the depletion of many natural resources, we are growing aware of the need to understand the risks that stem from different management decisions. Here, we outline an approach to test the ability of different dynamical signatures to characterize time-series data: how likely is it that a natural population is declining, sustainable, or increasing, and at what rates are these temporal changes likely occurring? These dynamical signatures can serve as a robust foundation on which to formulate alternative scenarios in a decision analysis. They take account of much of the uncertainty in model parameters and have precise mathematical underpinnings with associated risks. We present methods to evaluate the likelihood of these scenarios, and ways that the analysis can be graphically represented. We discuss different ecological factors such as climate variability, life history, ecosystem interactions, and a changing population age structure, all of which impact the dynamics of natural populations. Considering the types of dynamical signatures that emerge from these factors can change our understanding of risk and the decisions that we make.

ID HOMO-ECONOMICUS; BEHAVIOR; POLICY
AB The paper focuses on economic modelling and empirical analysis of sustainable structures in private consumption and strives to extend conventional economic consumption models. The model analysis of sustainable consumption in the areas heating and transport for Austria attempts to depart from traditional measurement of consumption in national accounts and economic consumption models. The focus of the analysis is laid on consumer services derived from a combination of stocks (e.g. building stock, transport systems) and flows (mainly energy). This approach intends to illustrate that a concentration on flows in consumption models lacks important aspects of sustainable consumption.
   The economic analysis of sustainable consumption patterns aims to highlight the effects related to the substitution of flows by stocks in the consumption areas transport and heating (e.g. improvements in thermal quality of buildings, more energy efficient transport systems). Relevant too, in this respect, is the role that can be played by technological innovation (improvements in energy efficiency of stocks, the potential for specific incentives to promote new technologies). Two essential factors are crucial in the context of sustainable consumption: the demand shifts concerning the consumer services desired and the composition of the stock-flow mix necessary for the service provision.

AB Sustainability in dairy farming is determined by using aspects (economic, social and ecological). Per aspect a number of measurable attributes is selected. Difficulty for determining the sustainability of farming systems is the combination of the different attribute measures into a sustainability function, which measures the overall sustainability. Furthermore, stakeholder groups often evaluate sustainability different and should be consulted to determine sustainability. In this research, the multi-attribute utility theory (MAUT) is used to develop an overall sustainability function for Dutch dairy farming systems. This approach consists of four steps: (1) determination of attribute utility functions, (2) assessing attribute weights to determine utility functions per aspect, (3) assessing aspect weights to determine the overall sustainability function per stakeholder group and (4) determination of the overall sustainability function for society by aggregating preferences of stakeholders and experts using a goal programming approach. Depending on the possibility for objective evaluation of each aspect, either experts or stakeholders were consulted to determine attribute utility functions and the utility functions of the particular aspect. In this study, experts determined (attribute) utility functions for economic and ecological sustainability. Stakeholders (producers, consumers, industrial producers and policy makers) determined their own utility function for external social sustainability and their own aspect weights. The developed overall sustainability function is applied to different Dutch dairy fanning systems represented by four experimental farms. MAUT proves to be a suitable method to determine an overall sustainability function. Sustainability rankings for the dairy farming systems appear to be relatively insensitive to changes in attribute and aspect weights. Based on these results, it is concluded that the developed sustainability function based on stakeholder and expert perceptions can be used with reasonable confidence to determine the sustainability of different dairy farming systems.

AB The purpose of this paper is to work toward reconciliation of the neoclassical consumer choice axiom that "more is better" and the ecological concern that "more is not sustainable." The key is to divide the desired "more" into its rival and nonrival components, for it is the consumption of rival goods (such as plastic) that strains the ecosystem. In contrast, the consumption of nonrival goods (such as bird-watching) leaves little to no footprint. While sustainability can be enhanced through changing preferences, a menu of taxes, subsidies and/or vouchers can also motivate greater nonrival consumption-and therefore sustainability-without reducing consumer welfare.

AB Liberalization has caused an increase in the global trade of goods and services. In particular, the value and physical volume of agricultural goods traded have largely increased. As the environmental and social consequences of trade are complex, they are rarely included in the national and international agricultural policies. One reason is that there is a lack of concepts and methods for assessing the environmental and social impacts of trade policies. In this paper we develop a method for quantifying and assessing the land use hidden in the export and import of agricultural goods for the case of Switzerland. For our analysis we focus on arable crops. The first methodological step of our research illustrates the spatial relationship of Switzerland with countries all over the world through the import and export of land use for arable crops. The second step links this spatial dimension with a qualitative assessment of the environmental and socio-economic impacts of agicultural land use. We applied the method to the case of wheat cultivation within Switzerland and import to Switzerland. The major problem we were confronted with was the availability of data, which had both to be reliable and available for the countries wheat is imported from. The results show that the calculation of land use is credible. In spite of the problems related with data availability, the assessment results for each indicator are in agreement with the current situation in the respective countries. In addition, the aggregation seems to accurately reflect the countries' agricultural polices. The developed method is used to estimate the overall environmental and socio-economic impacts of an increase in wheat imports to Switzerland. We argue that this method could be applied for anticipating potential impacts of trade agreements. Still, further research is required for fine-tuning of the utility functions, including a weighting procedure in the aggregation procedure. For practical applications important aspects like water shortage should enlarge our limited set of indicators. In addition the average impact on a country level was assessed. To refine that, different agricultural systems ranging from intensive to extensive to organic should be considered. Beyond our scope was to analyze impacts due to other life cycle stages than the agricultural production. For informed decision, however, information on the whole life cycle of agricultural products is required. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Ecological research targeting sustainable urban landscapes needs to include findings and methods from many lines of ecological research, such as the link between biodiversity and ecosystem function, the role of humans in ecosystems, landscape connectivity, and resilience. This paper reviews and highlights the importance of these issues for sustainable use of ecosystem services, which is argued to be one aspect of sustainable cities. The paper stresses the need to include social and economic factors when analyzing urban landscapes. Spatially explicit data can be used to assess the roles different green areas have in providing people with ecosystem services, and whether people actually have access to the services. Such data can also be used to assess connectivity and heterogeneity, both argued to be central for continuous, long-term provision of these services, and to determine the role urban form has for sustainability.

   CONTEXT
AB This paper explores the relationship between resilience and globalization. We are concerned, most importantly, with whether resilience is a suitable conceptual framework for natural resource management in the context of the rapid changes and disruptions that globalization causes in social-ecological systems. Although theoretical in scope, we ground this analysis using our experiences in two Asian coastal areas: Junagadh District in Gujarat State, India and Banawa Selatan, in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia. We present the histories of resource exploitation in the two areas, and we attempt to combine a resilience perspective with close attention to the impact of globalization. Our efforts serve as a basis from which to examine the conceptual and practical compatibility of resilience with globalization. The first challenge we address is epistemological: given that resilience and globalization have roots in different disciplines, do they share a sufficiently common perception of change and human action to be compatible? Second, we address the issue of how resilience can be a viable management objective in the rapidly changing context of globalization. We identify scale as particularly important in this regard.

AB Countries around the world have responded to the problems associated with rapid urban growth and increasingly land-consumptive development patterns by creating a wide range of policy instruments designed to manage urban growth. Of the array of growth management techniques, urban containment policies are considered by some to be a promising approach. This paper focuses on greenbelts, the most restrictive form of urban containment policy. The long-standing greenbelt of Seoul, Republic of Korea is examined as a case study. Seoul's greenbelt has generated both significant social costs and benefits. Costs include higher land and housing prices in the urban area surrounded by the greenbelt, additional costs incurred by commuters who live beyond the greenbelt and work in Seoul, and increased congestion and related quality of life impacts. Benefits include the amenity value of living near the greenbelt, recreational resources, bequest and heritage values, fiscal savings due to increased efficiency in the provision of public services and infrastructure, and a wide range of life-supporting ecosystem services. After standing virtually unchanged for almost three decades, Korea's greenbelt policy is currently being revised and weakened, largely due to pressure from greenbelt landowners and developers. Although there is no definitive answer to the question of whether Seoul would be a more or less "sustainable city" today without the greenbelt, it is certain that in the absence of the greenbelt, Seoul would have lost much of its rich natural heritage and essential ecosystem services.

AB Most research in the area of common and common-pool resources in the past two or three decades sought the simplicity of community-based resource management cases to develop theory. This was done mainly because of the relative ease of observing processes of self-governance in simple cases, but it raises questions related to scale. To what extent can the findings of small-scale, community-based commons be scaled up to generalize about regional and global commons? Even though some of the principles from community-based studies are likely to be relevant across scale, new and different principles may also come into play at different levels. The study of cross-level institutions such as institutions of co-management, provides ways to approach scale-related questions and deal with linkages in complex adaptive systems. Looking beyond self-governance, community-based resource management needs to deal with multiple levels of governance and external drivers of change, as illustrated in this paper with examples of marine commons.

AB Systems devised for managing tropical forests sustainably have yet to prove successful. In many instances, they have fallen short of initial prospects, but the reasons for these shortfalls are often not apparent. Here, we explore factors that can shape the likelihood of success, collectively referred to as background conditions, which are not always adequately considered prior to selecting a suitable management system. We examine the ability of one background condition, geologic terrane, to explain crude spatial variation in a number of trailing indicators of varying forest land use. Forest areas on Precambrian and Phanerozoic terranes show significant differences in production of fossil hydrocarbons, gold, and tropical roundwood, among other indicators, even after considering regional effects. Background conditions are considered to be factors capable of quantifying spatial variation in the likelihood of achieving management success given predefined benchmarks of sustainability. A number of avenues for further exploring and discriminating spatial variation of background conditions are discussed.

AB Traditionally, sustained yield (SY) has been viewed as a pillar of sustainable forest management (SFM), but this has been increasingly questioned. Ensuring SY of some species, i.e., a "strong sustainability" paradigm, could be an inadequate criterion if consideration of the social and economic components of the SFM concept are desired. SFM was translated into the ATO/ITTO set of principles, criteria, and indicators (PCI) for forest management in the Congo Basin; it resulted in the necessity for a certified logging company to ensure that no significant change in structure and floristic composition would result from logging operations. Besides raising the question of where to place the change threshold, we argue that sustainability must be considered from three indissociable viewpoints: ecological, social, and economic. The issue is how to balance these criteria, knowing that this assessment will involve potential conflicts of representations and beliefs. To discuss these questions, we used the example of two heavily logged timber species in the Congo Basin, sapelli (Entandrophragma cylindricum) and ayous (Triplochiton scleroxylon). Using long-term data collected from permanent sample plots in M'Baki, Central African Republic, we calibrated a matrix model and performed short- and long-term simulations to examine ( 1) the potential effect of repeated logging of the species under the current national regulation system and ( 2) the rules that should be set to reach long-term SY. Ensuring long-term SY would require a 22% and 53% decrease in the felling intensity of E. cylindricum and T. scleroxylon, respectively, at first cut, together with an increase in overall logging intensity targeted toward less-used species. Light-demanding E. cylindricum and T. scleroxylon require open forests to regenerate and grow. This new set of rules is probably economically unsustainable for the current African forest industry, and will not meet the ecological requirements encapsulated in the ATO/ITTO PCI. We thus stress the following points: ( 1) the importance of most exploited species for the current industry may change as wood processing capacities become more efficient and markets change, potentially providing conditions for harvesting a greater number of species; ( 2) floristic change is unavoidable in these conditions, but this problem should be addressed at a broad scale, notably by ensuring a network of protected areas; ( 3) as long as the timber industry remains one of the few sources of employment and revenues in marginalized countries, reducing SFM to SY of the most exploited species on every concession appears questionable.

AB The sustainability of regional development can be usefully explored through several different lenses. In situations in which uncertainties and change are key features of the ecological landscape and social organization, critical factors for sustainability are resilience, the capacity to cope and adapt, and the conservation of sources of innovation and renewal. However, interventions in social-ecological systems with the aim of altering resilience immediately confront issues of governance. Who decides what should be made resilient to what? For whom is resilience to be managed, and for what purpose? In this paper we draw on the insights from a diverse set of case studies from around the world in which members of the Resilience Alliance have observed or engaged with sustainability problems at regional scales. Our central question is: How do certain attributes of governance function in society to enhance the capacity to manage resilience? Three specific propositions were explored: ( 1) participation builds trust, and deliberation leads to the shared understanding needed to mobilize and self-organize; ( 2) polycentric and multilayered institutions improve the fit between knowledge, action, and social-ecological contexts in ways that allow societies to respond more adaptively at appropriate levels; and ( 3) accountable authorities that also pursue just distributions of benefits and involuntary risks enhance the adaptive capacity of vulnerable groups and society as a whole. Some support was found for parts of all three propositions. In exploring the sustainability of regional social-ecological systems, we are usually faced with a set of ecosystem goods and services that interact with a collection of users with different technologies, interests, and levels of power. In this situation in our roles as analysts, facilitators, change agents, or stakeholders, we not only need to ask: The resilience of what, to what? We must also ask: For whom?

AB The role humans should play in conservation is a pervasive issue of debate in environmental thinking. Two long-established poles of this debate can be identified on a preservation - sustainable use continuum. At one extreme are use bans and natural science-based, top-down management for preservation. At the other extreme is community-based, multidisciplinary management for sustainable resource use and livelihoods. In this paper, we discuss and illustrate how these two strategies have competed and conflicted in conservation initiatives in the Maya forest (MF) of the Middle Usumacinta River watershed ( Guatemala and Mexico). We further argue that both extremes have produced unconvincing results in terms of the region's sustainability. An alternative consists of sustainability initiatives based on place-based and integrated-knowledge approaches. These approaches imply a flexible combination of disciplines and types of knowledge in the context of nature - human interactions occurring in a place. They can be operationalized within the framework of sustainability science in three steps: 1) characterize the contextual circumstances that are most relevant for sustainability in a place; 2) identify the disciplines and knowledge(s) that need to be combined to appropriately address these contextual circumstances; and 3) decide how these disciplines and knowledge can be effectively combined and integrated. Epistemological flexibility in the design of analytic and implementation frameworks is key. Place-based and integrative-knowledge approaches strive to deal with local context and complexity, including that of human individuals and cultures. The success of any sustainability initiative will ultimately depend on its structural coupling with the context in which it is applied.

AB Based on an extensive review of the literature, and broad consultation with experts, we have assessed the sensitivity of Bornean vertebrates to the direct and indirect effects of timber harvest. Well-implemented selective logging has a relatively limited direct impact on wildlife populations: few species appear quite sensitive, some benefit, some decline. However, current management practices in Indonesian Borneo generally cause a decline in wildlife populations. Guidelines for sustainable forest management are primarily focused on trees, with few specific recommendations on how to sustainably manage wildlife populations in timber concessions. Based on our findings, we provide extensive wildlife management guidelines, pointing out the importance of maintaining understory vegetation and large trees for fruit, seed, dead wood, and tree hollow production, limiting canopy gaps, and reducing hunting and wildlife trade in concessions. In addition, we provide specific management advice on high priority species of Bornean vertebrates.

DE Corruption Perception Index; Environmental Sustainability Index
ID FRAMEWORK; GROWTH; INDICATORS
AB This paper explores the hypothesis that higher levels of corruption are detrimental to environmental sustainability. It does this by employing the Environmental Sustainability Index (ESI) and its component variables and indicators as promoted by the World Economic Forum and the Corruption Perception Index (CPI) created by Transparency International (TI). Both the CPI and ESI were shown to be statistically significantly related to income (proxied as GDP/capita) such that environmental sustainability declined with decreasing income while corruption worsened. The ESI for 2002 was also divided into indicators representing pressure, state, impact and response (i.e., the PSIR framework), and each of these were regressed onto a 'residual CPI' ( CPI of 2002 with the influence of income removed). The results suggest that for the most part the pressure, state and impact indicators of the ESI are not correlated with 'residual' CPI. The only statistically significant relationships with 'residual CPI' were for those of the response indicators of the ESI, although even here the R2 values were low (< 20%). Corruption was found to reduce any positive contribution from the response indicators towards environmental sustainability. However, great care needs to be taken when drawing conclusions from the sort of highly aggregated ( spatially as well as mathematically) indices as the ESI and CPI.

TI Bridging the science-management divide: Moving from unidirectional

   science-management divide; R& D programs; shared understanding; tacit

ID ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY; COMMUNICATION
AB Sustainable ecosystem management relies on a diverse and multi-faceted knowledge system in which techniques are continuously updated to reflect current understanding and needs. The challenge is to minimize delay as ideas flow from intent through scientific capability, and finally to implementation to achieve desired outcomes. The best way to do this is by setting the stage for the flow of knowledge between researchers, policy makers, and resource managers. The cultural differences between these groups magnify the challenge. This paper highlights the importance of the tacit dimension of knowledge, and how this renders the concept of knowledge transfer much less useful than the concepts of information transfer and technology transfer. Instead of knowledge transfer, we propose that "co-production" of knowledge through collaborative learning between "experts" and "users" is a more suitable approach to building a knowledge system for the sustainable management of ecosystems. This can be achieved through knowledge interfacing and sharing, but requires a shift from a view of knowledge as a "thing" that can be transferred to viewing knowledge as a "process of relating" that involves negotiation of meaning among partners. Lessons from informal communities of practice provide guidance on how to nurture and promote knowledge interfacing between science and management in R&D programs.

AB Although there is general agreement among conservation practitioners about the need for ( 1) social involvement on the part of scientists; ( 2) interdisciplinary approaches; ( 3) working on local, regional, and global levels; and ( 4) implementing international agreements on biodiversity and environmental protection, a major challenge we face in conservation today is how to integrate and implement these multiple dimensions. Few researchers have actually offered hands-on examples for showing in practical terms how such integration can be accomplished. To address this challenge we present an innovative case study: the Omora Ethnobotanical Park, a long-term biocultural conservation initiative at the southern extreme of the Americas. Located near Puerto Williams ( 55 S), Cape Horn Archipelago region, Chile, the Omora Park is a public-private reserve that provides material and conceptual foundations for three complementary conservation actions: ( 1) interdisciplinary scientific research; ( 2) informal and formal education, i. e., school, university, and training courses; and ( 3) biocultural conservation. The latter entails an actual reserve that protects biodiversity and the water quality of Puerto Williams' watershed, as well as programs on Yahgan traditional ecological knowledge and interdisciplinary activities, such as "field environmental ethics" and ecotourism, carried out in the reserve. Being at the "end of the world," and within one of the most remote and pristine ecoregions on the planet, Omora Park offers a "bio-cultural treasure." At the same time, its geographical and technological isolation presents a challenge for implementing and sustaining conservation actions. To achieve the general conservation goals, we have defined 10 principles that have guided the actions of Omora: ( 1) interinstitutional cooperation, ( 2) a participatory approach, ( 3) an interdisciplinary approach, ( 4) networking and international cooperation, ( 5) communication through the media, ( 6) identification of a flagship species, ( 7) outdoor formal and informal education, ( 8) economic sustainability and ecotourism, ( 9) administrative sustainability, and ( 10) research and conceptual sustainability for conservation. These principles have been effective for establishing the long-term Omora initiative, as well as involving multiple actors, disciplines, and scales. Upon these foundations, the Omora initiative has extended its local goals to the regional level through a successful 5-yr process in cooperation with the Chilean government to create the Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve, designated by UNESCO in June 2005, with the goal of establishing a long-term institutional-political framework that promotes social well-being and biocultural conservation at the southernmost tip of the Americas.

AB Environmental and resource regimes, operating at different levels of social organization, vary in terms of factors such as the sources of actor behavior, the knowledge available to actors, the operation of compliance mechanisms, the use of policy instruments, and the nature of the broader social setting. Cross-level interactions among scale-dependent regimes can result in patterns of dominance, separation, merger, negotiated agreement, or system change. The mechanisms that determine which of these patterns will occur include authority/power differentials, limits of decentralization, dueling discourses, cognitive transitions, and blocking coalitions. Recurrent linkages or syndromes occur in this realm, e. g., limitations of authority and power regularly produce negotiated agreements in such forms as comanagement arrangements. The consequences of these interactions are often far-reaching as measured in terms of ecological sustainability, social welfare/efficiency, cultural values, and robustness.

ID OPTIMAL MONETARY-POLICY; RATE PASS-THROUGH; OPEN-ECONOMY; FRAMEWORK;
   PRICES
AB The UK's monetary policy strategy is one of floating exchange rates and inflation forecast targeting, with the targeted measure referring to consumer prices. We consider whether it is welfare-reducing to target inflation in the CPI rather than in a narrower index and the role of the exchange rate in the transmission of monetary policy actions to CPI inflation. It is appropriate to model imports as intermediate goods rather than goods consumed directly by households. This leads to a simpler transmission mechanism of monetary policy while also offering a sustainable explanation of the weakness of the exchange rate/inflation relationship and making consumer price inflation an appropriate monetary policy target.

TI On the sustainability of the UK state pension system in the light of
   population ageing and declining fertility
SO ECONOMIC JOURNAL

ID IMMIGRATION
AB As a result of population ageing and declining fertility, the UK state pension system is unlikely to continue to be able to deliver the current level of pensions without some combination of a higher state pension age and a steady inflow of young immigrant workers from abroad. However, with prudent economic management and continuing economic growth, the need for additional immigrants can be contained and modest real increases in pensions are also a possibility. Higher economic activity rates among older people, including deferred retirement, will to some extent compensate but not eliminate these pressures. If fertility picks up over the next few years, this will also help, but not until after 2030.

ID CELLULASE PRODUCTION; STATE FERMENTATION; PURIFICATION; STRAIN
AB The Ordos Plateau in China is covered with up to 300,000 ha of peashrub (Caragana) which is the dominant natural vegetation and ideal for fodder production. To exploit peashrub fodder, it is crucially important to optimize the culture conditions, especially culture substrate to produce pectinase complex. In this study, a new prescription process was developed. The process, based on a uniform experimental design, first optimizes the solid substrate and second, after incubation, applies two different temperature treatments (30 degrees C for the first 30 h and 23 degrees C for the second 42 h) in the fermentation process. A multivariate regression analysis is applied to a number of independent variables (water, wheat bran, rice dextrose, ammonium sulfate, and Tween 80) to develop a predictive model of pectinase activity. A second-degree polynomial model is developed which accounts for an excellent proportion of the explained variation (R-2 = 97.7%). Using unconstrained mathematical programming, an optimized substrate prescription for pectinase production is subsequently developed. The mathematical analysis revealed that the optimal formula for pectinase production from Aspergillus niger by solid fermentation under the conditions of natural aeration, natural substrate pH (about 6.5), and environmental humidity of 60% is rice dextrose 8%, wheat bran 24%, ammonium sulfate ((NH4)(2)SO4) 6%, and water 61%. Tween 80 was found to have a negative effect on the production of pectinase in solid substrate. With this substrate prescription, pectinase produced by solid fermentation of A. niger reached 36.3IU/(gDM). Goats fed on the pectinase complex obtain an incremental increase of 0.47 kg day(-1) during the initial 25 days of feeding, which is a very promising new feeding prospect for the local peashrub. It is concluded that the new formula may be very useful for the sustainable development of and and semiarid pastures such as those of the Ordos Plateau. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB After a 15-year period of low incidence, dengue has reemerged in Singapore in the past decade. We identify potential causes of this resurgence. A combination of lowered herd immunity, virus transmission outside the home, an increase in the age of infection, and the adoption of a case-reactive approach to vector control contribute to the increased dengue incidence. Singapore's experience with dengue indicates that prevention efforts may not be sustainable. For renewed success, Singapore needs to return to a vector control program that is based on carefully collected entomologic and epidemiologic data. Singapore's taking on a leadership role in strengthening disease surveillance and control in Southeast Asia may also be useful in reducing virus importation.

AB In this study, performance experiments and economic analysis of a horizontal ground source heat pump (GSHP) system have been performed. The horizontal GSHP system connected to a test room, Elazig (38.41 degrees N, 39.14 degrees E), Turkey, was designed and constructed for space heating. The heating and cooling loads of the test room were 2.5 and 3.1 kW at design conditions, respectively. The performance was determined experimentally under real operational conditions. The experimental results were obtained from 7 November 2002 to 3 May 2003 in the heating season of 2002-2003. A detailed cost analysis was presented and payback periods when substituting for different local fuel/power sources were determined. The GSHP system was compared to conventional heating methods (electric resistance, fuel oil, liquid petrol gas, coal, oil and natural gas) in the economical analysis using an annualised life cycle cost method. It was shown that the GSHP system offers economic advantages over the mentioned first five conventional heating methods. However, it is not an economic alternative system to natural gas.

AB The development of nations is an unquestionable requirement. A lot of challenges concerning health, education and economy are present. A discussion on these development models has occupied the minds of decision makers in recent years. When energy supply and demand is considered, the situation becomes critical and the crucial question is: how to improve the quality of life of developing countries based on available models of development that are related to the life style of developed countries, for which the necessary use and waste of energy are present? How much energy is essential to humanity for not so as to endangering the survival conditions of future generations? The human development index (HDI) establishes the relationship among energy use, economic growth and social growth. Here it can be seen that 75% of the world population has a significant energy consumption potential. This is a strong reason to consider that the sustainable development concepts on energy policies are strategic to the future of the planet. This paper deals with the importance of seeking alternative development models for human development balance, natural resources conservation and environment through rational energy use concepts.

AB Human activities have profound impacts on the world's environment as well as on the quality of life. There is a growing awareness that industrial sustainability is a key means of bringing about a reduction of environmental impacts and an improvement of the quality of our life. The integration of biotechnology into chemical manufacturing has the potential to reduce material and energy consumption as well as the emission of substances hazardous to health and the environment. In 2000, the Japanese government launched a new research and development project "Development of a Technological Infrastructure for Industrial Bioprocesses". This national project aimed at creating a new biotechnological basis for making a contribution to lowering energy consumption in production, primarily in chemical production, expanded use of renewable biomass resources, and a decrease of waste and pollution. This paper describes an overview of this national project, focusing on the development of basic technologies for environmentally friendly industrial bioprocesses.

AB We solve directly a general maximin (sustainment, intergenerational-equity) problem. Because the shadow values of a maximin problem do not correspond to the shadow values from a general discounted-utility solution, they correspond to the prices of only a very special competitive economy Virtual discount factors for the economy arise. They do not correspond to hyperbolic discount factors. Hartwick's rule is derived and generalized naturally to take into account non-autonomous and non-deterministic features of the economy. Under uncertainty, Hartwick's rule is the analytic expression of a form of precautionary principle. Hotelling's rule is a necessary condition, but may be more complex than has been appreciated in simple models. Some interpretations of strong sustainment are special cases of weak sustainment but, paradoxically, may be more difficult to solve.

TI Researching the sustainable city: three modes of interdisciplinarity

AB In this paper we explore the practice of interdisciplinarity by examining how the UK research councils addressed the problem of the sustainable city during the 1990s. In developing their research programmes, the councils recognised that the problems of the sustainable city transcended conventional disciplinary boundaries and that an interdisciplinary approach was needed. In practice, however, initially radical proposals to research the city as a complex combination of science and technology and society contracted into more cognate collaborations that emphasised either science or technology or society, with the result that interdisciplinarity came to be located within research councils rather than between them. This, in turn, led to the development of a third kind of interdisciplinarity as the responsibility for making the connections between the research programmes was outsourced to the user communities-the local authorities. Unfortunately, local authorities struggled to find the resources to conduct this work so that the radical interdisciplinarity recommended at the start of the decade remained unaccomplished at the end. In describing these events we emphasise roles of paradigms and epistemic cultures in shaping research approaches and the complications they raise for the triangulation between approaches that is assumed in the idea of interdisciplinarity. We do not wish to be entirely negative, however, and conclude by suggesting some ways in which the quality and success of this much-needed interdisciplinary work could be increased.

AB In the quest for sustainable development, numerous examples of 'best practice' have been created and circulated in national and international arenas. Yet despite the vast array of examples, demonstration projects, case studies, and the like, little is known about the ways in which best practices are produced and used, and their role in processes of policymaking. Focusing on best practice for urban sustainability, the author argues that, rather than conceptualising its role and impact in terms of policy transfer or lesson drawing, the creation, dissemination, and use of best practice can be better understood as a discursive process, in which not only is new knowledge created about a policy problem, but the nature and interpretation of the policy problem itself are challenged and reframed. Drawing on insights from concepts of governmentality, the author argues that best practices are at once a political rationality and a governmental technology through which the policy problem of urban sustainability is framed and defined. Illustrations of the practice of best practice show how contradictions emerge between claims for general applicability and the need for policy actors to understand the contingencies of the process of urban sustainability, in order to enrol it for their own struggles over sustainability. The local stickiness of best practices points to the very real struggles that the rationalities of urban sustainability have in competing with other governmentalities which seek to shape urban futures.

TI Job-housing mismatch: affordability crisis in Surrey, South East England
SO ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING A-ECONOMY AND SPACE
LA English
DT Article
AB Rising housing costs and lack of affordable housing in London are affecting labour recruitment and retention, particularly in the public sector-the 'key-worker problem of recent government statements. But housing and labour-market problems are not confined to London. In this paper we highlight the extent and nature of affordability, recruitment, and retention problems in a high-cost location outside the capital: Surrey in South East England. We suggest that changes towards a more professional and managerial workforce have impacted on housing demand and hence prices. Planning and physical constraints have contributed to housing shortages and exacerbated rising housing costs. High housing costs are linked to recruitment and retention difficulties not only for public-sector employers but also for certain types of private-sector employers in Surrey. This raises problems for the sustainability of the local economy. Measures introduced to address these difficulties are helping 'key workers' to access housing locally, but this simply bids up house prices rather than increasing the overall supply of housing that is affordable.

AB E-government tools provide municipal planning departments with an alternative means to inform and engage their citizenry. We examine the use of information and communication technology e-government tools to promote citizen participation in the planning process. The analysis is based on an examination of municipal planning-related websites for the 590 US cities with a 2000 Census population of 50 000 or more. We also explore the influence which demographic contextual factors have on what tools are provided. Principal findings highlight the dominance of simple, information-based, e-government tools. The analyses also suggest that population-related and geographic-related variables are significant and pervasive influences on the provision of these tools.

TI Governing space: planning reform and the politics of sustainability
SO ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING C-GOVERNMENT AND POLICY
LA English
DT Article
ID REGIONAL-DEVELOPMENT AGENCIES; GOVERNANCE; MINERALS; POLICY
AB The authors explore the relationship between land-use, or spatial, planning and the environmental sustainability of major areas of public policy. First, the planning-public policy relationship is conceptualised within a framework that challenges narrowly instrumental accounts of the role of planning in the promotion of environmental sustainability, emphasising instead how the exploitation of opportunity structures in planning has impinged over time on dominant sectoral objectives. This framework is then used to analyse reformist pressures on planning, with particular reference to England's 'modernising planning' agenda. The argument is developed through a critical analysis of how, in the light of key components of this agenda-resealing, streamlining, and the introduction of a statutory purpose-planning, public policy, and environmental sustainability might be expected to interact in future. Early signs suggest that the initial reform proposals-to accelerate the delivery of development by restructuring opportunities for participation-were diluted (but not displaced) by strong opposition. Tracing the long-term impacts of the reforms will require research into the relations between the reconstituted tiers of planning and the ability of interest groups to use the new opportunity structures effectively-tasks that should interest analysts of the greening of the state as much as planning researchers.

TI Green niches in sustainable development: the case of organic food in the
   United Kingdom
SO ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING C-GOVERNMENT AND POLICY
LA English
DT Article
ID TECHNOLOGY; MOVEMENT; SYSTEMS; AGRICULTURE
AB Strategic niche management is a recently developed policy approach which advocates claim, is important in seeding radical transformations in sociotechnical regimes, and transitions to environmentally sustainable regimes in particular. This paper examines a critically important aspect of this approach: the relationship between radically novel sociotechnical practices in niches and the mainstream social-technical regimes they seek to influence. Although the literature notes the significance of this relationship, it does so in a paradoxical way. It is argued that niches are more likely to influence mainstream change when they show a degree of compatibility with the incumbent regime. Yet this compatibility criterion blunts the scope for niches to be radically innovative, thereby undermining the degree of regime transformation being sought. The case of organic food is used to explore this paradox empirically. The history of the organic niche, and its engagement and entanglement with the mainstream food regime, suggests a dialectical relationship between sociotechnical niches and regimes.

DT Article
DE renewable energy; biomass; miscanthus; combustion; pellets; straw;
   European standards EN 303-5
AB In this paper we present, for the first time, data on the combustion of Miscanthus x Giganteus straw and pellets. We found that the heating value of Miscanthus is 17.744 MJ/kg. The gaseous emission indices of SO2, NOx and total organic carbon (TOC) in the exhaust are reported and compared with the European standards for biomass boilers. On the basis of our results, it is possible to evaluate a net energy yield between 152 and 326 MJ/hectare/year for the cultivation of Miscanthus with an energy balance estimated to be in the range of 7.7-15.4. According to the presented results, it seems reasonable to consider Miscanthus as a promising candidate as alternative fuel.

SO ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS
LA English
DT Article
DE olive mill wastewaters; polyphenol; phytotoxicity; microbial toxicity;
   soil
AB Olive mill wastewaters are toxic for plants and microbes due to their high polyphenol content. We studied the effect of agricultural soil as a natural catalyst to promote polyphenol oxidation and polymerization, and in turn detoxify olive mill wastewaters. We show that model polyphenols are fully converted in soil slurries. Their products show no toxicity to the growth of a typical soil bacterium, Bacillus cereus, and reduced phytotoxicity in germination tests with English cress seeds. Those findings are promising for the sustainable treatment of olive wastewater in aerated soil slurries.

   perspective
SO ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION
LA English
DT Article

ID MYXINE-GLUTINOSA L; HAGFISH; MAINE; GULF
AB This paper provides the first analysis of imports and exports of fish leather by the USA. Estimates of minimum levels of trade were obtained from the records of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service for 1997-2001, and possible conservation consequences were considered. Data show that imported leather items used the skins of at least 51 types of fish. Of the 41 identified to species level, six were freshwater fish, eight diadromous and 27 were fully marine. Eels and hagfishes (marketed as 'eelskin'; eight named species), stingrays (10 named species) and sharks (15 named species) dominated the trade. An average of 725 000 fish-leather products, worth over US$ 6 million, was imported each year to the USA. A significant decline in fish leather imports over the five-year period studied derived largely from changes in 'eelskin' imports. Fish leather in the USA was reportedly sourced primarily from the Republic of Korea, mainland China and Thailand, although the records were flawed. About 93% of leather products were obtained from wild fish. Exports from the USA totalled approximately 5% of imports by volume. Many of the fish species comprising the largest imports for leather were characterized by low resilience to exploitation, with one-third of known species considered threatened or near threatened by the World Conservation Union (IUCN). This pilot assessment indicates the need for better record keeping if sustainability of fish exploitation for leather is to be evaluated.

AB The conservation of high-altitude medicinal plants is of concern throughout the Himalayan region, because they are important for traditional health care and in large-scale collection for trade. Because little is known regarding their conservation status in relation to the diversity of land-use patterns and habitats, this paper explores patterns of species composition and diversity of medicinal plants in five different pasture types in a traditionally-managed high-altitude landscape in northwest Nepal. Environmental variables, including human activities, strongly affected species composition, diversity and cover-abundance of medicinal plant species. Species richness of rare and commercially threatened medicinal plants (CTMP) showed patterns similar to overall medicinal plant species richness. Sub-alpine meadows, which have intermediate levels of human pressure related to grazing and relatively high levels of resource availability in terms of rainfall and soil nutrients, were richer in medicinal-plant species than alpine meadows. The coexistence of various plant communities under different human management regimes also enhanced landscape-level species diversity by maintaining some species restricted to particular habitat or pasture types. A number of medicinal plant species reported to be resistant to grazing were most abundant in heavily grazed sites. This pattern suggests that medicinal plant species may be positively influenced, to a certain extent, by human activities (mainly grazing). The combination of grazing and high levels of harvesting, however, had a negative impact on diversity and cover-abundance of rare and CTMP species. Maintenance of medicinal plant diversity and cover-abundance is critically dependent on managing grazing and resource harvesting to maintain levels that are both ecologically and economically sustainable. Forage for livestock and medicinal plants for local health care cannot be managed independently; a systems approach is needed, incorporating social management to accommodate the needs of different users. This could be achieved by maintenance of a mosaic landscape, in which different use patterns and pressures, reflecting the values attached to resources by different users and favouring different types of biodiversity, co-exist.

ID TORRES STRAIT; AUSTRALIA; FISHERY; MODEL
AB The sustainability of indigenous customary hunting and fishing in remote areas can be influenced by human factors operating at global as well as regional and local scales because of the hybrid nature and sectoral interactions of the local economic environment. The internationally significant population of dugongs (Dugong dugon or seacow) in Torres Strait between Australia and Papua New Guinea supports an important indigenous fishery. The economic, sociocultural and environmental factors that influenced hunting activity in 1998 and 1999 by the members of the community of Mabuiag Island were investigated to inform the sustainable management of the fishery. The landed catch during the eight months March to October of 145 dugongs in 1998 and 170 dugongs in 1999 potentially provided the community with an average of 290g of dugong meat per person per day. Fifty-seven per cent of adult males on the island participated in dugong hunting, but more than half the catch in each year was caught by only two hunters. The probability of at least one person from the community going dugong hunting in 1998 and 1999 was 0.59 +/- 0.02 per day. This probability was influenced by local environmental factors, including the abundance of dugongs in the traditional hunting grounds (affected by wind speed, year, season and lunar day) and the size of the commercial crayfish catch (which is influenced by the global market price, as well as local conditions). Although dugong hunting remains a very important part of the islanders' contemporary culture and customary economy, the capacity to hunt dugongs is facilitated by the ease with which some hunters move between the state, commercial and customary sectors of their local economy. The complexities of the economic, social and cultural environments need to be considered in planning for the sustainable harvesting of threatened species by remote indigenous communities.

TI Two shades of green: Food and environmental sustainability
SO ENVIRONMENTAL ETHICS
LA English
DT Article
AB The politics of food illustrates an enduring tension within environmental ethics and green political theory: the oft-assumed division between those thinkers for whom humanitarian goals remain prominent but who situate them within a normative framework stressing environmental sustainability and those thinkers who reject any distinctively humanitarian interests as untenably anthropocentric. In posing the problem as a moral dilemma between feeding people and saving nature, light and dark green value theories are made to appear in stark contrast, with the former prescribing the delivery of food aid to relieve hunger-related suffering, and the latter rejecting that call. This supposed dilemma between feeding people and saving nature is a false one. The real problem is a moral elitism on the part of developed countries where an insidious form of selfishness overemphasizes the role of population and obscures the roles of highly variable rates of consumption upon current environmental ills. An examination of the exemplary case of food politics shows that the exaggerated differences in policy implications of these two value theories can be diminished and that there is potential for common cause.

AB In a semiarid region, the karst aquifer generally forms a large groundwater reservoir that can play an important role in regional water supply. But because of the specific physical properties of karst aquifers, they are vulnerable to pollution and anthropogenic impacts. Karst groundwater management strategies are vital. As representative of karst springs in a semiarid area, Niangziguan Springs is located in the east of Shanxi Province, China with an annual average rate of discharge of 10.34 m(3)/s (1956-2003) (Y. Liang, unpublished data). The Niangziguan Spring Basin covers an area of 7,394 km(2) with an annual average precipitation of 535 mm (1958-2003) (Hao et al. in Carsologica Sinica 23(1):43-47, 2004). Over the past three decades, accelerated groundwater exploitation has caused water-table decline in the aquifer, reduction of the spring discharge, and deterioration of water quality. In this study, three protection zones were defined to ensure the quality and capacity of this resource. The confluence of the 11 spring systems and the discharge areas were defined as I protection zone, the recharge basin was II protection zone, and the slack water area where there is little surface recharge was the III protection zone. Management strategies for each zone were suggested and evaluated to provide a scientific foundation for sustainable utilization.

AB Pluriactivity of farms, or part-time farming, is a common feature of agriculture in all countries regardless of their socioeconomic system and level of development. Currently, pluriactivity is related to the values of sustainable agriculture. The objective of this study is to delineate those specific characteristics of pluriactive farms that contribute to sustainable agriculture. In rural areas of Boetia in Greece, a socioeconomic survey was carried out on 114 farms to determine the types of farming applied. The results demonstrate that pluriactivity is a stable component of the agricultural structure in the rural areas of Boetia. It is widespread in plains, but its presence is more important in mountainous and semimountainous areas. The choice of young farmers is to opt for pluriactivity. Farm size does not differ between pluriactive and full-time farms. Pluriactive and full- time farms use the same level of input and get the same output for the same type of crop. However, pluriactive farmers under the same land-productive conditions are oriented toward a more extensive farming system, managing their land with crops that need less inputs. Considering these findings, it can be claimed that pluriactivity can contribute to diminishing the demand on natural resources in favored (level and irrigated) areas, to continue agricultural production in unfavorable (mountainous and semimountainous) areas, and to help the sustenance of the rural population.

AB The generation of reliable updated information is critical to support the harmonization of socio-economic and environmental issues in a context of sustainable development. The agro-environmental assessment and management of agricultural systems often relies on indicators that are necessary to make sound decisions. This work aims to provide an approach to (a) assess the environmental performance of commercial farms in the Pampas of Argentina, and (b) propose a methodological framework to calculate environmental indicators that can rapidly be applied to practical farming. 120 commercial farms scattered across the Pampas were analyzed in this study during 2002 and 2003. Eleven basic indicators were identified and calculation methods described. Such indicators were fossil energy (FE) use, FE use efficiency, nitrogen (N) balance, phosphorus (P) balance, N contamination risk, P contamination risk, pesticide contamination risk, soil erosion risk, habitat intervention, changes in soil carbon stock, and balance of greenhouse gases. A model named Agro-Eco-Index was developed on a Microsoft-Excel support to incorporate on-farm collected data and facilitate the calculation of indicators by users. Different procedures were applied to validate the model and present the results to the users. Regression models (based on linear and non-linear models) were used to validate the comparative performance of the study farms across the Pampas. An environmental dashboard was provided to represent in a graphical way the behavior of farms. The method provides a tool to discriminate environmentally friendly farms from those that do not pay enough attention to environmental issues. Our procedure might be useful for implementing an ecological certification system to reward a good environmental behavior in society (e.g., through tax benefits) and generate a commercial advantage (e.g., through the allocation of green labels) for committed farmers.

   Europe
AB The Albanian Forum of Public Health (AFPH), an umbrella organization including different public health associations operating in Albania, was established in March 2004 with the support of the European Public Health Association (EUPHA) and the Open Society Institute (OSI). Ever since its establishment the AFPH has been an open arena wherein opinions and options for rational health policies comprising all relevant issues of the New Public Health are discussed, formulated, and documented near the Albanian Ministry of Health.
   Notwithstanding the laudable mission of the AFPH, there is an emerging need to establish a regional Public Health Forum in south-east Europe as a basic prerequisite for sustainable development of public health in these countries. Most conveniently, this regional umbrella organization should have a supporting Secretariat based in one of the south-east European countries. Nevertheless, there is a clear call for international funding with participation of different agencies and bodies (OSI, EUPHA, Canadian International Development Agency, and the Stability Pact). A regional association in the south-east Europe would enable the organization of annual conferences in the most renowned institutions in the region. Also, a regional collaboration among public health associations would be a suitable start for the development of research in south-east Europe. Furthermore, the existence of a regional public health association would make feasible the establishment of a scientific public health journal for south-east Europe in the English language.

AB This paper analyses the foundations of regional knowledge and its long- term impact on the region's companies' and how a particular knowledge has developed an ability to stay competitive within a specific technological field. The case illustrates how the Copenhagen region has been able to develop a dominating position in the global market for industrial enzymes from 1870-2004. The case of industrial enzymes shows how a region has been able to build sustainable competitive advantages from its distinctive competencies. This is done through a mixture of outsourcing and in sourcing of competencies, knowledge and technologies from other regions in a ramified set of interacting networks.

AB In the framework of a public awareness campaign introducing new practices of fertilization in a group of farmers, the paper analyses the conditions of professional ecological behaviors in favor of sustainable development. Verbal associations and focalized interviews were set up in order to explore the links between the perception of the environment and pro-environmental behaviors, as well as the kind of relationships farmers built up with their environment. The result showed that the type of representation, the environmental awareness, and the perceived responsibility did not explain behavioral differences. The professional occupation was dominating among the farmers in the relationship with the anthroposystem. The representation of the farmers' own professional activity and its future was explicative of their relationships with their environment, and consequently of their behaviors. (c) 2006 Elsevier SAS.

AB There is strong evidence that genetic capacity for growth evolves toward an optimum rather than an absolute maximum. This implies that fast growth has a cost and that trade-offs occur between growth and other life-history traits, but the fundamental mechanisms are poorly understood. Previous work on the Atlantic silverside fish Menidia menidia has demonstrated a trade-off between growth and swimming performance. We hypothesize that the trade-off derives from the competing metabolic demands associated with growth and swimming activity. We tested this by measuring standard metabolic rate (M-STD), maximum sustainable metabolic rate (M-ACT) and metabolic scope of laboratory-reared silversides originating from two geographically distinct populations with well-documented differences in genetic capacity for growth. The fast-growth genotype had a significantly greater M-STD than the slow-growth genotype, but a similar M-ACT when swum to near exhaustion. The scope for activity of the fast-growth genotype was lower than that of the slow-growth genotype. Furthermore, the fast-growth genotype eats larger meals, thereby incurring a greater postprandial oxygen demand. We conclude that a metabolic trade-off occurs between growth and other metabolic demands and that this trade-off provides a general mechanism underlying the evolution of growth rate.

AB With increasing emphasis on sustainable agriculture, there is renewed interest in the use of native plants as alternative sources for food, fiber, and soil improvement. Eastern gamagrass [Tripsactim dactyloides (L.) L.] is a native, warm-season, perennial grass found in the eastern United States that has been used for forage and soil improvement. The objective of this research was to investigate the forage composition and digestibility of eastern gamagrass grown on a degraded, acid soil at the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center, Beltsville, MD. Eastern gamagrass forage samples were harvested at time of heading in July of 1997, 1998, and 1999 from plants grown on a degraded hillside with increasing soil acidity and decreasing surface soil depth from the bottom to top of the hillslope and analyzed for fiber, crude protein, and in situ digestibility. Year of harvest had the greatest effect on forage composition. Fiber composition was related to slope position and soil acidity. Plants were generally high in fiber as reflected by high neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and acid detergent fiber (ADF) contents, but were not particularly high in lignin. Crude protein (6-11%) and digestibility were good. In general, forage quality, as indicated by lower fiber (NDF, ADF, lignin) and higher digestibility and crude protein, increased as soil condition degraded and environmental stress (deficit rainfall) increased. Thus, eastern gamagrass is comparable in forage composition and digestibility to many forages currently used even when grown on poor soil and under environmental stress. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB Fishing gear usage in small-scale coastal fisheries of Pelabuhanratu Bay, Indonesia was explained by two approaches: temporal fishing gear allocation analysis and adaptive responses of fishers to external factors, especially climate and abundance of target species. Gear usage, with the exception of hand lines and seine nets, was more intensive during the dry season than the rainy season. The decision to use seine nets was governed by seasonal variability in the abundance of Auxis thazard, Lacepede, and Trichiurus spp. to the catch. Sustainable management of fishing activities in Pelabuhanratu Bay requires proportional reductions in the use of lift nets and fixed gillnets across the seasons rather than gear specific effort reductions.

AB This paper reports on the population dynamics of Dosidicus gigas from the Gulf of California over the period of the 1995-1996 to 2001-2002 fishing seasons. Data were collected on mantle length, individual weight, and total catch. The D. gigas catches varied, with the lowest landings (1970t) in the 1997-1998 fishing season and the highest (41,330t) in 2001-2002. Mantle length ranged from 16 to 96 cm. The mantle length-mass relationship for all seasons showed allometric growth. Growth and natural mortality of D. gigas varied between seasons. The analysis of cohorts showed high interannual variability in annual fishing mortality, annual exploitation rate, recruitment, and mean abundance. The Thompson-Bell predictive model indicated that in some seasons the maximum sustainable yield could have been obtained with 30-50% of the current fishing mortality. However for other seasons the maximum sustainable yield could have been obtained with a current or greater fishing mortality. The fishing mortality associated with the maximum sustainable yield, F-MSY, did not necessarily coincide with the fishing mortality associated with a level of proportional escape of spawning biomass, F-%BR. The variability observed in this study is typical of squid populations but impossible to anticipate using the Thompson-Bell model. Consequently, auxiliary information (i.e. from research cruises) reflecting such variability in recruitment is needed to make accurate predictions and efficiently manage these resources. Extreme care should be taken in using these methods alone to predict future yields of D. gigas. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A study was made on the growth of the Argentine Sandperch Pseudopercis semifasciata in the San Matias Gulf (Patagonia, Argentina). Specimens were obtained by sampling landings from the trawl fleet, which operated during the period 1990-1992, from San Antonio Oeste port (Rio Negro Province). A total of 967 individuals (505 female, 462 male) were examined. Age determinations were made by microscopic observations of treated (broken and burned) and untreated otoliths and growth parameters were determined by fitting size-age data to a von Bertalanffy model. Data were analyzed separately by year and for females and for yellow and gray color variants of males. Significant differences were observed between the growth parameters of the females and each of the two color morphs of the males. These differences may be related to the type of reproductive strategy in P. semifasciata. The results obtained were compared with those of previous studies, and discussion is presented on considerations required for sustainable management of the species and its' fisheries.

AB 1. A comprehensive analysis was carried out on the effects of stocking on the genetic structure of Iberian brown trout evolutionary lineages. Introgression and genetic diversity were estimated from allozyme results of 307 populations based on own data (180) and available literature (127). Stocking records, angling regulations and environmental features related to hatchery trout performance were also analysed to determine the underlying mechanisms of the introgression effects.
   2. Fifty per cent of analysed populations showed introgression by genes of hatchery origin. The mean introgression estimated by the single locus approach S was 0.134. An increment of both heterozygosity and polymorphism was observed when introgression increased in stream-dwelling populations, which could finally produce a homogenisation of the genetic structure of populations and a decrease of the species' genetic diversity.
   3. Introgression rate varied among Iberian evolutionary lineages (Evolutionary Significant Units), and was correlated with the stocking effort, except for the North Atlantic basins. The lack of adaptations for migratory behaviour in hatchery trout could explain the low impact of stocking in North Atlantic rivers where anadromous populations occur.
   4. Angling regulation did not seem to influence the survival of hatchery trout. Introgression tends to be higher in heavily stocked localities with fertile waters and stable discharge, which may favour the performance of hatchery trout.
   5. Trout management must be based on increasing population size by means of habitat improvement and sustainability of naturally reproducing wild stocks through appropriate angling regulations.

ID LANDSCAPE
AB The high specific richness of the vascular flora of the National Park of 'Alta Murgia' (Apulia, Italy) has been originated by a long co-evolutionary process of biophysical and anthropic systems. Natural disturbances on the one hand and the anthropic on the other, as years go by, in their mutual interaction, have created suitable conditions for the coexistence of a high number of taxa. Following an ecological and floristic survey of grasslands of Alta Murgia, many species of great phyto-geographical value or, however, threatened by genetic erosion and/or extinction together with other plants traditionally employed by man as officinal and for food and non-food purposes, were recorded. The ecological conditions that allow the persistence of these plant communities must be searched in the delicate equilibrium established among the natural dynamics and the set of disturbance regime, for great part due to the traditional land use. The actual social and economic transformations of the area, without safeguarding programmes to be carried out according to sustainability criteria, can produce a serious biodiversity decline. Starting from the 'sustainable use' definition of the CBD, the present paper deals with some focal points to realize the sustainable management of the biodiversity of the Park of Alta Murgia.

AB One hundred and three natural populations of Medicago L. were collected in Spain, mainly from roadsides, non-irrigated or grazed lands. This germplasm was evaluated at Montpellier (France) with control cultivars and Spanish landraces under completely random block design, replicated four times, and observed for 64 qualitative or quantitative characters. Differences between natural populations and cultivated controls are highly significant, but gene flow occurs between wild and cultivated compartment and hybrid populations were identified. On the basis of multivariable analysis, the accessions were grouped into four clusters depending on their proximity with the cultivated pool to facilitate their management and ex situ conservation. The relationship between environment of the site of collection and phenotypic characteristics of the natural populations was also discussed. Different policies of conservation of these genetic resources are suggested to avoid their disappearance even when they disappeared from the other regions of the western Mediterranean. Spanish wild pool of alfalfa, also called 'Mielga', appears of great interest for the breeding of alfalfa because it contains a large diversity of characteristics (prostrate habit, rhizomes) linked to tolerance to grazing or drought environment. With the need for more sustainable systems in agriculture, the erosion of natural habitats and the necessity for rehabilitation of degraded ecosystems, the importance of this wild pool is really inestimable.

AB Historically, smelters have been a major source of metals and SO(2) released to the environment in Canada. The study of emissions in the environment around smelters is therefore a priority in evaluating policies in relation to sustainable development. This Special Issue is devoted to papers on various projects supported under three Canadian programmes on metals in the environment. Scientific questions addressed by these programmes include understanding how emitted metals impact the surface environment in different settings, estimating the smelter outputs of metals, distinguishing smelter-derived releases from geogenic contributions, and understanding the fate of current emissions of metals and metalloids and their accumulation during the twentieth century. The approach of the scientific team involved characterizing the spatio-temporal distribution of smelter-emitted metals in the plume and in various surficial media around selected Canadian smelters.
   This overview paper summarizes some of the findings discussed in the Special Issue, specifically that: (1) smelter-emitted metal-bearing solids have characteristics that allow their quantification and permit the evaluation of their contribution to the metal load of natural media; (2) delineation of smelter 'footprints' can be approached by mathematical estimation or by measurement of multi-element or isotope ratios; and (3) investigation of archival geological systems provides time series that reflect the point-source inputs.

AB An overview is presented of recent work on the environmental changes impacting on Australia and the policy responses of the State and Commonwealth governments, especially over the last ten years. This period has seen a remarkably stable phase of conservative government administration in Canberra and consistent resistance to a strong environmental policy agenda, both domestically and internationally. Attention is focused particularly on rural and regional Australia, rather than on urban areas. The paper discusses the role of environmental issues in recent elections and also details the results of relevant opinion polls charting changes in environmental attitudes. The problems posed by the federal system of administration are outlined as are recent analyses and counter-analyses of the state of the Australian environment. A more fundamental problem with liberal democracy and environmental values is also addressed.

DT Article
AB Argumentation is increasingly being used in educational discourse in the United Kingdom. Geographical education has recently started to engage with this field to explore its potential as a pedagogical tool to increase learners' capabilities to think both individually and collaboratively. This article outlines the theoretical background of argumentation, its relevance to thinking skills and real-world issues explored in geography, including themes relating to sustainability and global citizenship. it also presents recent developments in ICT which are facilitating the argumentation process in terms of both visualisation of the outcomes of argumentation - argument maps and supporting collaborations between several people both synchronously and asynchronously. The DUNES system is presented as one example of a computer supported argumentation visualisation (CSAV) software package. Some indications are given as to bow a more specifically geographical type of argument map (which combines concetual and spatial material) is starting to develop.

AB Purpose: This article describes early efforts of four community partnerships in Boston, El Paso, Houston, and Milwaukee to address governance and management structures in ways that promote the sustainability of innovative community-based long-term care system improvements. The four communities are grantees of the Community Partnerships for Older Adults Program, a national initiative of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation that fosters local partnerships to improve long-term care and supportive-services systems in order to meet the current and future needs of older adults. Design and Methods: We examined community partnership approaches to governance and management, as well as evidence of the partnerships' influence in their communities, by using the conceptual framework of the community health partnerships typology developed by Shannon M. Mitchell and Stephen Shortell. Results: Addressing governance and management issues was critical to the early evolution of community partnerships for older adults. Early partnership experiences, particularly with regard to local funders and media, provide evidence of emerging centrality (importance and influence in the community), which forecasts sustainability. Observation over a longer period is needed in order to see whether early successes will be sustained, particularly once original grant funding ends. Implications: Community partnerships for older adults can become influential positive forces but must invest in adequate governance and management structures early on.

ID SURGERY
AB To evaluate the effects of part-time occlusion therapy on types of intermittent exotropia and sustainability of converted types.
   Forty-four and 26 children with basic-type and convergence-insufficiency-type intermittent exotropia, respectively, were evaluated in this study. Upon initial examination, we obtained both distant and near deviating angles using prism cover tests, after correcting for refractive errors. We conducted occlusion of the nondeviating eye for 3 months at 3 h/day and assessed the changes in types of intermittent exotropia. We also observed the changes of deviating angles and sustainability of types after 3 months of cessation of part-time occlusion in patients who did not undergo surgery.
   Preocclusion deviating angles (mean +/- SD) were determined to be 27.1 +/- 7.46 prism diopters (PD) on distant measurements and 30.6 +/- 7.92 PD on near measurements. After 3 months of occlusion, the deviating angles were 25.9 +/- 9.10 PD on distant measurements and 21.4 +/- 11.00 PD on near measurements, corresponding to a significant reduction (p=0.005 and p < 0.001, respectively). Fourteen patients (32%) suffering from basic type of intermittent exotropia converted to the pseudodivergence excess type. In patients suffering from the basic type who exhibited no changes in type, 9 patients (20%) exhibited reductions on both near and distant angle measurements. Among the convergence insufficiency type of patients, 18 (69%) converted to basic type and 2 patients (7%) converted to the pseudodivergence excess type. In the 15 patients who did not undergo surgery, the converted types were maintained in 6 patients, though the other 9 patients showed regression to the prepatching types after cessation of patching for 3 months.
   Part-time occlusion therapy resulted in the conversion of the basic and convergence insufficiency types to pseudodivergence excess and basic types in more than half of the intermittent exotropes. Future studies on correlation between type conversion and surgical outcome would be necessary.

TI Hydrogeology of the Kabul basin (Afghanistan), part I: Aquifers and
   hydrology
SO GRUNDWASSER
LA German
DT Article
AB Shallow groundwater currently represents the main source for water supply in Kabul. Detailed information on the hydrogeology of the Kabul basin is therefore needed to improve the supply situation and to develop sustainable concepts of groundwater use. The basin is situated at the intersection of three major fault systems and comprises three major aquifers, all consisting of coarse sandy to gravely material originating from the surrounding mountains. The aquifers were deposited by several rivers draining the basin. Marl is the basal layer of the aquifers. Usually the aquifers are covered by loess loams which are an important feature in groundwater protection. The coarse aquifer material has high permeability. Deeper parts are affected by cementation of pore spaces, resulting in formation of semi-diagenetic conglomerates which decrease well yields. The main groundwater recharge occurs after the snowmelt from direct exfiltration from the rivers and from foothill infiltration. The high withdrawals of the last few years and a steadily rising population have led to a strong overexploitation of the groundwater resource as indicated by falling groundwater levels and deteriorating groundwater quality.

TI Building the green way
SO HARVARD BUSINESS REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB Just five or six years ago, the term "green building" evoked visions of barefoot, tiedyed, granola-munching denizens. There's been a large shift in perception.
   Of course, green buildings are still known for conserving natural resources by, for example, minimizing on-site grading, using alternative materials, and recycling construction waste. But people now see the financial advantages as well. Well-designed green buildings yield lower utility costs, greater employee productivity, less absenteeism, and stronger attraction and retention ofworkers han standard buildings do. Green materials, mechanical systems, and furnishings have become more widely available and considerably-often less expensive than they used to be cheaper than their standard counterparts. So-building green is no longer a pricey experiment; just about any company can do it on a standard budget by following the ten rules outlined by the author.
   Reliable building-rating systems like the U.S. Green Building Council's rigorous Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design,(LEED) program have done much to underscore the benefits of-green construction. LEED evaluates buildings and awards points in several areas, such as water efficiency and indoor environmental quality. Other rating programs include the UK's BREEAM (Building Research Establishment's Environmental Assessment Method) and Australia's Green Star.
   Green construction is not simply getting more respect; it is rapidly becoming a necessity as corporations push it fully into the mainstream over the next five to ten years. In fact, the author says, the owners of standard buildings face massive obsolescence. To avoid this problem, they should carry out green renovations.
   Corporations no longer have an excuse for eschewing environmental and economic sustainability. They have at their disposal tools proven to lower overhead costs, improve productivity, and strengthen the bottom line.

TI An evaluation of the Health Promoting Health Service Framework: the
   implementation of a settings based approach within the NHS in Scotland
SO HEALTH PROMOTION INTERNATIONAL
LA English
DT Article
DE health service settings; evaluation
ID PUBLIC-HEALTH; CAPACITY; PROJECT
AB In 1996 the Health Education Board for Scotland (now NHS Health Scotland) began a process of developing a 'settings'-based framework that would inform health promotion work across Scottish health services-the Health Promoting Health Service Framework (HPHS). It took the form of a flexible guidance document, attending to the foundations of integrated and sustainable health promotion practice via specific areas like partnership work, policy development and staff health. The project has subsequently been progressed over an extended period, comprising three phases: an initial development of the resource; piloting of the framework; and a wider assessment of implementation and initial impact. This paper reports on the latter phase. Within the context of various issues pertaining to the evaluation of a 'settings' approach and based on the use of case study methodology in nine HPHS pilot sites, this paper reports on the latter 2 year phase. This involved ongoing concern for understanding intervention processes and a growing interest in intervention outcomes and the paper reports on findings in each of these domains. In relation to outcomes, some positive gains in various indicators were detected though significant problems were experienced in this aspect. More significantly, the work was able to gain insights into what we call 'necessary conditions' of implementation. We theorize a range of 'contextual' factors (e.g. responsiveness to health improvement policy agendas) and project specific 'mechanisms' (e.g. providing skilled support) and present these as a nexus of conditions required for effective implementation of health promotion practice within explanatory models. Most significantly, we stress the relative frailty of any settings implementation strategy based simply on the uncoordinated dissemination of a tool or resource.

TI Trust, risk and health care reform
SO HEALTH RISK & SOCIETY
LA English
DT Article
DE trust; risk; rationality; interdisciplinarity; NHS; reform
AB Across the developed world, governments face severe challenges in health care reform as demand rises and resource constraints grow more stringent. In the UK, the current government is devoting considerable resources to welfare state reform and (arguably) achieving real improvements in services such as the NHS and education. Despite this, the reforms remain highly controversial and there is considerable concern about lack of trust in the new welfare policies. A decline in trust may undermine the public acceptability of the reforms and threaten the ability of government to gain electoral support for them. Recent work in sociology, political science and psychology indicates that rational deliberative and non-rational valued-based or affective factors contribute to trust in institutions. At the same time, theoretical arguments suggest an increasing need for public trust. Trust facilitates the co-ordination of complex enterprises under conditions of uncertainty, especially valuable at a time when rising demand and intensifying pressures for spending constraint provide a continuing impetus for reform. One possibility is that policies designed within a rational actor framework may erode the non-rational aspects of trust, so that the service improves but trust in it declines, with consequences for the political sustainability of reformed health care systems. Risk research in health care has a good opportunity to consider issues of institutional trust and to build inter-disciplinary links in doing so.

AB AVRDC-The World Vegetable Center was established in 1971 as a not-for-profit international agricultural research institute whose mission is to reduce malnutrition and poverty among the poor through vegetable research and development. Over the past 30 years, AVRDC has developed a vast array of international public goods. The Center plays an essential role in bringing international and interdisciplinary teams together to develop technologies, empower farmers, and address major vegetable-related issues in the developing world. In its unique role, AVRDC functions as a catalyst to 1) build international and interdisciplinary coalitions that engage in vegetable and nutrition issues; 2) generate and disseminate improved germplasm and technologies that address economic and nutritional needs of the poor; 3) collect, characterize, and conserve vegetable germplasm resources for worldwide use; and 4) provide globally accessible, user-friendly, science-based, appropriate technology. In enhancing and promoting vegetable production and consumption in developing world, AVRDC's research programs contribute to increased productivity of the vegetable sector, equity in economic development in favor of rural and urban poor, healthy and more diversified diets for low-income families, environmentally friendly and safe production of vegetables, and improved sustainability of cropping systems. Recent achievements at AVRDC that greatly impact tropical horticulture in the developing world include virus-resistant tomatoes raising farmers income, hybrid sweet pepper breaking the yield barrier in the tropics, flood-resistant chili peppers opening new market opportunities, broccoli varieties for monsoon season, pesticide-free eggplant and leafy vegetable production systems and fertilizer systems that protect the environment. Beyond vegetable crops, AVRDC is playing an important role in expanding and promoting research and development efforts for high value horticultural crops, including fruit, ornamentals, and medicinal plants through its new Global Horticulture Initiative. AVRDC believes that horticulture crop production provides jobs and is an engine for economic growth. The important role AVRDC-The World Vegetable Center plays in developing and promoting tropical horticultural crops is discussed in this paper.

AB Soil conservation is widely regarded a critical component of sustainable livelihood strategies for the hillsides of Honduras. However, neoliberal polices have reduced economic incentives for agricultural intensification. Recent studies indicate off-farm work opportunities address poverty in a way conservation and development efforts do not. Yet off-farm work may discourage poor farmers from practicing soil conservation. A middle ground is needed. This study indicates micro-credit can substitute for off-farm work and encourage soil conservation practice. Many regions throughout Honduras have had extensive contact with soil conservation programs and would benefit more from credit services than redundant technological extension.

TI Post-frontier forest change adjacent to Braulio Carrillo National Park,
   Costa Rica
SO HUMAN ECOLOGY

   zones; sustainable development; Costa Rica
ID LAND-COVER CHANGE; TRANSITION; DEFORESTATION; CONSEQUENCES
AB Effective biodiversity conservation in national parks depends to a large extent on adjacent forest cover. While deforestation and forest fragmentation as a result of colonization and agriculture have been widespread in neotropical countries over the past few decades, in some places agricultural intensification, wage labor, and rural to urban migration are becoming the most important emerging trends. Changes like this have resulted in forest recovery in other places, mostly in temperate zones, but there have been few studies of this phenomenon in the tropics. This paper presents a case study from a national park buffer zone in Costa Rica. An expansion of Braulio Carrillo National Park (BCNP) in 1986 forced the closing of a frontier that had been characterized by spontaneous colonization and widespread forest-to-pasture conversion. After that time, the Sarapiqui region surrounding the northern sector of BCNP underwent a dramatic social and economic transformation. Population more than doubled, new roads created easy access to a coastal port and the capital city (San Jose), industrial agriculture and ecotourism enterprises expanded, and population and urbanization along major highways increased. In spite of government reforestation and forest protection programs and changes in rural people's attitudes favoring forest conservation, we find that there has been only slight detectable forest recovery in satellite imagery and that forest fragmentation continued, even in remote rural areas near BCNP with stable or shrinking population. We attribute this to the consolidation of landholdings into large cattle ranches and smaller hobby ranches, driven by an inflow of capital from urban areas and developed countries. This pattern has important implications for the management of this and other national park buffer zones. We suggest that strategies focused only on sustainable land use inside buffer zones are unlikely to succeed when carried out in a context of certain macro-level changes. Conservation of endangered biological resources will only be possible if we broaden our thinking about national parks and adjacent lands in the tropics to address new land ownership and use patterns that are occurring as a result of globalization, urbanization, and expanding wage labor employment.

TI Changing the internal health and safety organization through

SO HUMAN FACTORS AND ERGONOMICS IN MANUFACTURING
LA English
DT Article
ID ERGONOMICS
AB Research from several countries indicates that the internal health and safety organization is marginalized in most companies, and it is difficult for the professionals to secure a proper role in health and safety on the companies' present agenda. The goal of a Danish project involving a network of I I companies was to search for a solution to this problem. The health and safety managers and safety representatives played the role of "change agents" for local projects aiming to develop the health and safety organization. The study showed that 3 of the 11 companies proved to be able to implement successful changes; 5 were partially successful; 3 were nonperformers. The more successful outcomes seem to depend on the abilities of change agents to handle a complex and unpredictable project. Based on these case studies, it has been possible to deduce some strategies change agents must follow to fulfill such a process. Such strategies require the ability to be able to identify opportunities for change, establish a sustainable problem definition, and build coalitions. An amoeba model is suggested as a metaphor for this type of development project. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ID SELF-HELP GROUPS; BREAST-CANCER; WOMEN; IDENTITY
AB This paper examines the process of indigenization within peer support groups for Haitian women living with the chronic physical impairment of lymphatic filariasis. Five support groups established in a coastal community were studied over a period of three years to understand the adaptation of the Western illness support group model to the local cultural milieu. Unlike most support groups in affluent settings, the Haitian women showed minimal interest in talking about illness-related issues. The groups developed a distinctly Haitian style characterized by emphasis on religion and spirituality, artistic and expressive components, and acquisition of practical skills that offer income-generating opportunities. Members directed the greatest energy toward developing microenterprise activities. This pattern of adaptation is discussed in terms of indigenous traditions of mutual aid in rural Haiti, the compelling material needs of families living in stark poverty, and the ongoing challenge of coping with political and economic insecurity. Results are framed within a theoretical discussion of contextual factors that lead self-help groups into social action beyond the groups' original purposes. The analysis also addresses the conditions needed for long-term sustainability of support groups, and the way in which fundamental needs shape group activity.

AB Since the early 1990's, "community forestry" has taken the spotlight in conservation and development initiatives in the Bolivian Amazon, particularly among indigenous peoples. This paper will examine the cases of two culturally related indigenous groups, the Siriono and Yuqui, who are both stakeholders in community forestry management projects. The first project, carried out among the Siriono by the NGO ( non-governmental organization) CIDDEBENI ( Centro de Investigacion y Documentacion para el Desarrollo del Beni), was funded by several international NGOs and governmental entities. It was small-scale and the staff had in-depth knowledge of the indigenous culture, practiced careful planning, engaged in participatory decision-making, and provided continuous monitoring and documentation for assessment. As a result, the project has contributed positively to the cultural continuity and integrity of the Siriono people and their economic development. The second project, targeted at the Yuqui and carried out by the USAID-funded forestry project BOLFOR ( Bolivia Sustainable Forest Management Project), was a minor part of this large-scale and complex project, and the staff was lacking in knowledge of the indigenous culture, carried out little planning, and provided virtually no monitoring or oversight. This paper compares and contrasts these two forestry projects and the management decisions that contributed to their relative success or failure. An analysis is provided that addresses planning and implementation issues that should be considered for similar projects in the future.

AB Many of Canada's Aboriginal peoples have adopted the language, concepts and procedures of environmental resource management in order to advance their needs, rights and interests in co-management. Drawing on the author's experiences in co-management, the advantages and disadvantages of this project for Canada, its Aboriginal peoples, and its landscapes are explored. Alternatives to the status quo, grounded in social, cultural and ecological sustainability, and modelled after the two-row wampum, are then considered. Both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal parties to co-management must critically examine current management policies and practices in order to develop innovative approaches that will create the space required for the meaningful and equitable inclusion of Aboriginal peoples in decisions taken in respect to their lands and resources.

AB In order to address the problem of realistic assessment of groundwater potential and its sustainability, it is vital to study the recharge processes and mechanism of groundwater flow in fractured hard rocks, where inhomogeneties and discontinuities have a dominant role to play. Wide variations in chloride, delta O-18 and C-14 concentrations of the studied groundwaters observed in space and time could only reflect the heterogeneous hydrogeological setting in the fractured granites of Hyderabad (India). This paper, based on the observed isotopic and environmental chloride variations of the groundwater system, puts forth two broad types of groundwaters involving various recharge processes and flow mechanisms in the studied granitic hard rock aquifers. Relatively high C-14 ages (1300 to similar to 6000 yr B.P.), delta O-18 content (-3.2 to -1.5 parts per thousand) and chloride concentration (< 100 mg/l) are the signatures that identified one broad set of groundwaters resulting from recharge through weathered zone and subsequent movement through extensive sheet joints. The second set of groundwaters possessed an age range Modern to similar to 1000 yr B.P., chloride in the range 100 to similar to 350 mg/l and delta O-18 from -3.2 to + 1.7 parts per thousand. The delta O-18 enrichment and chloride concentration, further helped in the segregation of the second set of groundwaters into three sub-sets characterized by different recharge processes and sources. Based on these processes and mechanisms, a conceptual hydrogeologic model has evolved suggesting that the fracture network is connected either to a distant recharge source or to a surface reservoir (evaporating water bodies) apart from overlying weathered zone, explaining various resultant groundwaters having varying C-14 ages, chloride and delta O-18 concentrations. The surface reservoir contribution to groundwater is evaluated to be significant (40 to 70%) in one subset of groundwaters. The conceptual hydrogeologic model, thus evolved, can aid in understanding the mechanism of groundwater flow as well as migration of contaminants to deep groundwater in other fractured granitic areas.

AB The water balance of the closed freshwater Lake Awassa was estimated using a spreadsheet hydrological model based on long-term monthly hydrometeorological data. The model uses monthly evaporation, river discharge and precipitation data as input. The net groundwater flux is obtained from model simulation as a residual of other water balance components. The result revealed that evaporation, precipitation, and runoff constitute 131, 106 and 83 x 10(6) m(3) of the annual water balance of the lake, respectively. The annual net groundwater outflow from the lake to adjacent basins is 58 x 10(6) m(3). The simulated and recorded lake levels fit well for much of the simulation period (1981-1999). However, for recent years, the simulated and recorded levels do not fit well. This may be explained in terms of the combined effects of land-use change and neotectonism, which have affected the long-term average water balance. With detailed long-term hydrogeological and meteorological data, investigation of the subsurface hydrodynamics, and including the effect of land-use change and tectonism on surface water and groundwater fluxes, the water balance model can be used efficiently for water management practice. The result of this study is expected to play a positive role in future sustainable use of water resources in the catchment.

AB Data from the Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) survey over the past 40 years have shown that the abundance of copepods fit many parts of the North Atlantic has declined, indicating geographical shifts in the Plankton communities. Because the CPR does not sample all zooplankton species with equal efficiency, these observations may give a biased view of the overall changes. Here, we compensate for CPR undersampling by using previously published species-specific correction factors derived from comparisons of catches made with WP-2 ring-nets and the CPR. Based oil such corrected data, the southern North Sea showed the highest concentrations of biomass, in contrast to maps based oil uncorrected data, in which the areas of highest biomass were in the northern North Sea. Trend analysis confirmed the previously reported general decrease of total biomass. There has also been a general decrease in the mean size of zooplankton over time in the northern North Sea. but this has not been observed elsewhere. The results indicate the importance of smaller zooplankton species in the ecology of the Northwest European shelf. The changes of community structure may have general implications for energy transfer efficiency to higher trophic levels, and for the sustainability of fisheries resources.

AB Interactions between grey seal, Atlantic salmon, and harvest controls on the salmon fishery in the Gulf of Bothnia, northern Baltic Sea, were investigated for the period 1999-2003. We assessed the effects of seal-induced catch losses (fish damaged or eaten by seals in the fishing gears) and harvest restrictions (delayed sequential opening of the fishery from south to north) on the Finnish coastal salmon catch and on escapement of salmon into the Tornionjoki River, the major breeding ground of the species in the Baltic Sea. Commercial logbook data on catches and seal-induced catch losses were used in a stochastic Monte Carlo analysis, indicating that mainly because of the stricter harvest controls enforced in 1996 and 1997, the average annual spawning run abundance that approached the Finnish coastal area increased by ca. 56700 fish between 2000 and 2002. However, these fish were caught increasingly in the northern Gulf of Bothnia (Management Areas, MAs, 3 and 4), and relatively few salmon escaped into the Tornionjoki River. The landings in MAs 3 and 4 increased by 57% and 144%, respectively, whereas in the southern Gulf of Bothnia (MA 1), landings decreased by 23%. Over the five years of the study, seal-induced catch losses in MA 1 ranged from 24% to 29% of the total catch, whereas in MAs 2, 3, and 4 it ranged from 3% to 16%. The analysis suggests, however, that in MA 1 the regulation-induced catch losses were even higher than seal-induced catch losses, indicating that the salmon fishery was being impacted by both major factors. To increase escapement into the river and potentially to increase the future wild salmon catch, the opening of the harvest in the northernmost MAs should be delayed. Seal-induced catch losses should be reduced by extensive introduction of seal-safe fishing gears and by sustainable control of the grey seal population.

TI Social marketing: an overview of approach and effects
SO INJURY PREVENTION
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper reviews the applicability of commercial and social marketing to teen driving safety. It draws on a wide range of information, including evaluation studies of specific programs as well as standards of practice within these two professions. Social marketing has been widely applied for more than three decades in the fields of public health, environmental protection, and political marketing with significant success. The paper attempts to distinguish between the practice of commercial marketing, whose goal is profit, and the practice of social marketing, whose goal is societal benefit. Issues of sustainability, segmentation, differences in behavioral characteristics, and cultural competence are discussed with specific examples drawn from the transportation safety literature. The paper suggests that social marketing represents a viable companion to control and education approaches to behavior change to promote teen driving safety.

   STRATEGY; INTERVENTIONS; DIRECTIONS; QUALITY
AB This paper examines the theoretical underpinning of the community based approach to health and safety programs. Drawing upon the literature, a theory is constructed by elucidating assumptions of community based programs. The theory is then put to test by analyzing the extent to which the assumptions are supported by empirical evidence and the extent to which the assumptions have been applied in community based injury prevention practice. Seven principles representing key assumptions of the community based approach to health and safety programs are identified. The analysis suggests that some of the principles may have important shortcomings. Programs overwhelmingly define geographical or geopolitical units as communities, which is problematic considering that these entities can be heterogeneous and characterized by a weak sense of community. This may yield insufficient community mobilization and inadequate program reach. At the same time, none of the principles identified as most plausible appears to be widely or fully applied in program practice. The implication is that many community based health and safety programs do not function at an optimum level, which could explain some of the difficulties in demonstrating effectiveness seen with many of these programs.

DE forest certification; developing countries; sustainable forest
   management
AB Certification has been developed as an instrument for promoting sustainable forest management. Although the initial focus of certification was on tropical forests, it rapidly shifted to encompass all forest types. Ten years after the first certification schemes were developed, most (91.8 percent) of the 271 million hectares of forests that have been certified are located in Europe and North America. Only 13 percent of certified forests are located in developing countries and only 5 percent of the certified forests are located in the tropics. Among the reasons for this disparity are: weak market demand for certified products in global markets; wide gaps between existing management standards and certification requirements; weak implementation of national forest legislation, policies and programs in developing countries; insufficient capacity to implement sustainable forest management at the forest management unit level and to develop standards and delivery mechanisms; and the high direct and indirect costs of obtaining certification in developing countries. Despite these challenges and constraints, many developing countries remain interested in pursuing certification. Several promising developments have recently emerged that may give further encouragement to developing countries' efforts, including supportive codes of forestry practice, stepwise approaches to certification and increasing interest in forest certification and certified products in the Asia-Pacific region.

DE forests; sustainable yield; landowners; forest plantations; small-scale
   forest plantations
AB Solomon Islands is recovering from a period of civil war that has contributed to a rate of harvesting of its natural forests that far exceeds the sustainable level of cut. This over-cutting means that within a decade the country faces a 15-year period during which it will be unable to produce commercial quantities of timber from its natural forests. As the forest industry is a major component of the economy this will have serious consequences. Plantations have the potential to bridge this resource gap. Because of the land tenure system it is difficult to establish large-scale commercial plantations. The AusAID funded Forestry Management Project and the Forestry Division of the Ministry of Forestry, Environment and Conservation have successfully encouraged individuals and families to plant high value trees. If the current planting rate of 1000 hectares per year can be maintained then this will ensure the survival of the forest industry.

AB When signing Agenda 21, several countries agreed to monitor the status of forests to ensure their sustainable use. For reporting on the change in spatial forest cover pattern on a regional scale, pattern metrics are widely used. These indices are not often thoroughly evaluated as to their sensitivity to remote sensing data characteristics. Hence, one would not know whether the change in the metric values was due to actual landscape pattern changes or to characteristic variation of multitemporal remote sensing data.
   The objective of this study is to empirically test an array of pattern metrics for the monitoring of spatial forest cover. Different user requirements are used as point of departure. This proved to be a straightforward method for selecting relevant pattern indices. We strongly encourage the systematic screening of these indices prior to use in order to get a deeper understanding of the results obtained by them. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE antibiotic guidelines; proper usage of antimicrobial drugs; proper
   animal treatment; present state of veterinary scientific knowledge;
   hygiene package
AB Antimicrobial drugs in livestock farming are not used for therapeutic purposes, only, but also to conceal deficiencies in animal husbandry and management. Use of antibiotic drugs should be restricted by specific regulations, since some veterinarians seem to have an interest in increasing their income by treatment of diseases instead of performing health management. The above-mentioned requirements have been fulfilled by 56 a (2) of German Pharmaceuticals Act, which regulates the usage and dispensary of pharmaceuticals according to the current standards of veterinary science. These current standards of veterinary science are described by common scientific positions and specific opinions of certain relevant committees. There is no single institutional committee available at present. Therefore, members of the German Federal Chamber of Veterinarians and members of the Committees of the German Federal States, which are responsible for the compliance with regulations and acts, defined a common position on current standards of veterinary science, concerning correct treatment with antibiotic drugs within a Working Group of the Federal States for Veterinary Pharmaceuticals (former ArgeVet, now AG TAM), the so-called "antibiotic guidelines". These antibiotic guidelines should help veterinary practitioners to use and prescribe those substances only, which are accurate for treatment of the diagnosed disease concerning the used class of antibiotic, amount, and duration of usage. The responsible authorities have to proof the prudent and proper use of antibiotic drugs in the range of their surveillance. The surveillance by the authorities is complicated, since the burden of proof of improper usage of antimicrobial drugs lies within the responsibility of the authorities. Prevention can primarily be conducted by informing the responsible veterinarians of the proper forms of treatment and by strict regulations for registration of pharmacologically active substances. Every additional label use and the usage of existing old registrations may undermine the surveillance of improper usage of pharmacologically active substances in livestock animals. The responsible authorities of the German Federal States, which may vary in their organization among the states, have to administrate the following duties: (1) Surveillance of manufacture and distribution of pharmaceuticals. (2) Inspection and control of proper usage of pharmaceuticals. Thus, the surveillance of distribution of veterinary pharmaceuticals has a broader range of requirements in comparison to surveillance of human pharmaceuticals. It is necessary to record and to control the amount of used drugs as well as their ways of distribution to perform a sufficient surveillance. The legal authorization was created by the 11(th) Amendment of the German Pharmaceuticals Act, but these specifications are still too imprecise to support the surveillance in the current process. Hence, the actual surveillance process is more focussed on usage and dispensary of pharmaceuticals and less focussed on manufacture and distribution. Therefore, the current surveillance with the aim to limit unnecessary usage of pharmacologically active substances according to the current legislation is limited. It is necessary to change legislation with regard to control of distribution of pharmaceuticals as well as integration of self-control of livestock owners for a sustainable increase of efficacy.

AB Conservation efforts are often aimed at one or a few species. However, habitat sustainability relies on ecological interactions among species, such as seed dispersal. Thus, a community-scale conservation strategy may be more valuable in some settings. We describe communities of primary (primates) and secondary (dung beetles) seed dispersers from 5 sites in the Brazilian Amazon. We estimate community biomass of these taxa and, using multivariate ordination, examine the potential for natural reforestation at each site, given the communities of seed dispersers present. Since disturbed habitat is increasingly common and increasingly the focus of conservation efforts, we also examine differences among seed disperser communities between primary forest and secondary growth at each site. Analyses of faunal biomass in different localities and habitats indicate that secondary growth receives nearly as much use by primates as primary forest; given the dominant groups of dung beetles in secondary growth, disturbed habitat should show a pattern of seed burial that is clumped and deep. Areas with high biomass of Alouatta spp. and the large nocturnal dung beetle species may have the greatest potential for natural reforestation of secondary growth particularly for large seeded species. The data suggest that knowledge of the biomass of primary and secondary dispersing fauna facilitates predictions for the likelihood of disturbed habitat to regenerate and comparisons of sites in broader geographical areas e.g., Neotropical vs. Paleotropical forests.

AB The crop livestock integrated farming system practiced in hilly regions of developing countries largely depends on the ecosystem as a whole. More especifically, the livestock component of the farming system relies heavily on natural resources such as forest, grazing and agricultural land for the supply of feed and fodder. The importance of animals as agents of nutrient recycling, sources of rural energy in terms of draft power and fuel, as well as being major contributors to the farm economy, has resulted in an increased population of ruminants in these regions, creating a threat to the sustainability and productivity of these land resources. This paper is an attempt to evaluate the livestock carrying capacity of land resources and to formulate the optimum herd size compatible with the differently resourced farm categories within the sub-watershed region of the mid-hills in Nepal. Our analysis reveals that the livestock carrying capacity of the land resources at the watershed level is 11696 Livestock Units (LU), whereas current stocking is 12985 LU, suggesting an overstocking of 1289 LU at the watershed level. Total feed supply from different sources is 12668 mt/yr whereas current Total Digestive Nutrient (TDN) demand is 14060 mt/yr, a negative balance of 1393 mt/yr. The excess livestock at the sub-watershed level directly implies excess livestock holding, producing a poor nutritional status for the farm household. Linear programming analysis reveals that the farmers of large, medium and small category farms can optimize their livestock holding by a combination of 3 LU buffaloes and 4 LU goats, 2 LU buffaloes and 4 LU goats and 1 LU buffaloes and 4.4 LU goats, thus giving maximum return to the farm family without exerting pressure on fragile natural resources.

AB Yar tsa Gumba, the local name for Cordyceps sinensis, is an entomophilus fungus in the order Hypocreales and family Scolecosporaceae, found primarily in alpine and subalpine regions, from 3200 to 4000 m asl. The fungus is parasitic on caterpillars, primarily those in the genus Hepialus. Studies on Cordyceps sinensis indicate that the fungus may improve liver function, reduce cholesterol, adjust protein metabolism, inhibit lung carcinoma and treat aging disorders. In the last five years, since it was found in parts of Garhwal and Kumaun Himalaya, massive exploitation has occurred, leading to a drastic decrease in wild populations. This paper presents results of an exploration carried out on the fungus at several important sites, the mode of trafficking and suggested policy initiative for its sustainable exploitation.

AB Rural household food insecurity and poverty are closely linked to soil degradation in Sub-Saharan Africa. However, causes, degradation processes, coping strategies and need for interventions may vary from one place to another. This study was conducted in Mbinga District, SW Tanzania, to investigate causes and biophysical processes of soil degradation; effects on livelihoods, coping strategies and entry points for interventions. Implications for sustainable production and rural livelihoods are discussed. Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA), household surveys using a short open-ended questionnaire and biophysical exploration were the research tools used. Soil fertility depletion resulting from continuous cropping and erosion losses is the main form of soil degradation. Maize yield was 57% lower in fertility-depleted farms than in productive farms. Soil pH, Ca2+, Mg2+ and CEC accounted for 79% of variations in maize yield. Organic soil fertility amelioration was a common strategy used by smallholders. Use of beneficial tree and shrub fallows is the most environmentally, economically and socially promising improvement that can be used to build on the existing strengths of farmers' knowledge and strategies. Subsidy for the right type of fertilizers, infrastructure improvement and education of farmers on proper use of fertilizers should significantly contribute to improved and sustainable production and livelihoods.

AB Ever since the Earth Summit was launched at Rio de Janeiro, research has been done on the problems of developing indices for the health of the environment and for its sustainable development. However, this research has concentrated more on national and regional levels than on local levels, more on spatial comparisons than on time series analysis, more on short-term than on long-time analysis, more on qualitative than on quantitative analysis. In contrast, therefore, this paper presents an indicator system procedure for measuring Beijing (the capital of China) environmental sustainability based on the Pressure-State-Response (PSR) philosophy, evaluates the trend of Beijing environmental sustainability index (BESI) quantitatively for 21 years, from 1983 to 2003, and suggests three great opportunities in the near future that are expected to provide some dependable information to policy makers. The results suggest that Beijing is still far from environmental sustainable development. The total trend was better in the 1980s than in the 1990s, and has improved slightly since 2000.

AB In 1999, the Chinese government initiated a massive conservation programme, the 'Grain-for-Green' programme, to reduce soil erosion and to improve the eco-environmental status in western China through the set-aside of sloping agricultural lands and their conversion to forest and pasture. The attitudes and perceptions of farmers towards Grain-for-Green are little known, but will eventually dictate the direction and, ultimately, the success of the project. This paper interprets surveys concerning attitudes towards environmental protection, in general, and the Grain-for-Green programme, in particular, in two small catchments in the Loess hilly area. Participatory Rural Assessment techniques are used as survey instruments and logistic regression analysis is used to analyze farmers' attitudes towards environmental conservation and Grain-for-Green. Most respondents are positive about environmental protection and Grain-for-Green in general. However, marked differences are evident between the two small catchments: the level of farmers' environmental protection consciousness in Anjiapo catchment is higher than that in Danangou catchment. Respondents in Anjiapo catchment expressed more support for the programme than respondents in Danangou catchment. Environmental care by farmers may not be sustainable should the programme come to an end. The results provide a useful insight into the interests and concerns of farmers, which might lead to a more positive attitude in officials in the future.

DE China; land use; cultivated land; supporting capacity; food security
AB In recent years, China's cultivated land has been shrinking, a change which has become one of the potential challenges to national sustainable development and global food security. In our research, we have predicted China's cultivated land resources for the next 50 years, based on scrutiny of systematic data and analyses of the loss of cultivated land. We have also designed an indicator of cultivated land equivalent per capita (CLEPC) to assess the capacity of cultivated land to support our population. The results show that China's cultivated land will decline to a minimum of 113.31 million ha between 2001-2010, while cultivated land per capita will decline from 0.101 ha to 0.083 ha. After 2010, the area of cultivated land will begin to increase slowly to 118.98 million ha in 2050. However, cultivated land per capita will still decline to 0.079 ha between 2010-2030; after 2030, it will start to increase and reach 0.085 ha in 2050. In contrast to the total area and per capita area of cultivated land, the CLEPC will remain at 0.101 ha between 2001-2010, and then increase to 0.156 ha in 2050. Overall, there will be increasing stress on China's cultivated land during the next two or three decades. Although the supporting capacity of cultivated land may not decline obviously with improvement in agricultural technology and infrastructure, China has to make great efforts to reduce the loss of cultivated land and to improve its productivity to ensure food security in the near future.

AB The provision of clean drinking water, sanitation and stormwater disposal has become a major challenge for the urban centres of the developing world. The number of cities with a population of more than 10 million has increased from one in 1950, to 16 in 2000, and is expected to increase to 21 by 2015. In 2000, 47.2% of the global population was urban, and this percentage is increasing steadily. The rapid rate of urbanization has far exceeded the management and financial capacities of all the levels of governments of all developing countries from about 1960. While more and more people have received access to water and sanitation in recent years, much more remains to be done. At the present rate, it is unlikely that the Millennium Development Goal of reducing by half the proportion of people without sustainable access to drinking water by 2015, can be achieved universally. The problems faced by the major urban centres of the developing world are analysed, and the opportunities and constraints they face are assessed.

ID MANAGEMENT
AB The world's population growth is dominated by urban growth, particularly in Asia and Africa. Urbanization is seen most dramatically as the growth of large urban agglomerations, which are mushrooming in all developing regions of the world. This demographic change is bigger than any other change that human history has recorded. Whereas in 1975, only 190 million people lived in cities with more than 5 million people, the figure had gone up to 394 million by the year 2000. The UN forecast tells that in 2015, over 600 million people are expected to have their home in a megacity. This paper summarises global demographic trends and prospects and relates them to the water sector challenges of large urban agglomerations in developing countries. Nine case cities are under particular focus. They are Dhaka, Jakarta, Bangkok, Riyadh, Singapore, Johannesburg, Istanbul, Sao Paulo and Mexico City. Whereas the approach and level of success is different in each case, no city can escape massive technical investment, institutional development and strong political will in managing their water and related environmental challenges in a sustainable way.

TI Water management in ArRiyadh
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB ArRiyadh is a good example of rapid transformation of a small city, with an area of less than 100 km(2) and a population of less than 400 000 in 1970. to a big city with an area of about 1600 km(2) with a population of 4.26 million in 2004. The population of ArRiyadh is expected to be more than 10 million by 2020. The rapid development of the city has lead to a major rise in demands on water and sanitation services. During the late 1970s until the mid-1990s, supply management practices were used to satisfy the rapid growth in water demands. With the financial support of about US$20 billion from the government, the growing domestic demands of more than 500 million m(3)/year have been satisfied. About 47% of the water supplied is groundwater pumped from local aquifers, and the remaining 43% comes front costly desalinated sea water from the Jubail plant on the Arabian Gulf coast, 466 km from the city. Sanitation services cover no more than about 35% of the city due to the rapid expansion of its area and the related high costs of infrastructure construction. The leakage from water networks, excess irrigation waterfront landscaping and seepage from septic tanks have contributed to a rise in the groundwater table, resulting in several negative impacts. A more effective water management approach has been experienced in the city since the establishment of the new Ministry of Water and Electricity in 2001 whose focus has shifted to water demand management and conservation. The results of such new approaches have been positive and promising in meeting the water challenges and in achieving sustainable developments under severe and conditions.

AB In an earlier article, "Ideas, artifacts and facilities: information as a common-pool resource", we examined the role of collective action in building robust knowledge commons and in circumventing trends of enclosure and privatisation of the intellectual public domain. Our analysis suggested that collective action and new institutional design play as large a part in shaping the collection, distribution, and preservation of scholarly information as do legal restrictions and market forces. The microbiological commons extends well beyond the boundaries of e-prints and other full-text research documents that are the focus of the open access movement. It includes the contents of scientific databases, research archives, and multimedia publications which all need to be seamlessly integrated. In addition, the global, biological commons is also comprised of social networks and social capital. The success of freely sharing microbiological data will require a complex blend of technology, scientific content, metadata standards, open source software packages, negotiated and respected intellectual property rights agreements, sustainability and preservation design mechanisms, evolving rules and institutions, and, ultimately, a firm commitment on the part of providers and users to the common good.

AB Soil organic carbon storage encompasses both soil productivity and environmental capabilities. The influence of fertilizer (nitrogen and phosphorus) levels (0 NP, 0.5 NP, 1.0 NP (recommended standard) or 1.5 NP) on total system productivity, sustainable yield index and soil organic carbon storage in Vertisols (Typic Haplustert) under groundnut and fallow-based cropping systems were examined in a field experiment over 6 years. The aim was to identify a system that provided an acceptable balance between total system productivity and soil organic carbon restoration. The experiment comprised two rainy season crops (groundnut or fallow) and five post-rainy season crops (wheat, mustard, chickpea, sunflower or summer groundnut), each post-rainy season crop with four levels of NP fertilizer. The total system productivity was 130% higher in the groundnut-based than in the fallow-based system and was in the order: groundnut-groundnut > groundnut-chickpea > groundnut-wheat > groundnut-mustard > groundnut-sunflower. The sustainable yield index was highest in the groundnut-groundnut system. The gross C input was relatively higher in the groundnut-based system but the C loss rate was greater. The amount of residue needed per ha per year to compensate for loss of soil organic carbon was estimated to be 4.3 t in the fallow-based and 7.6 t in the groundnut-based cropping system. Though the total system productivity was greater in groundnut groundnut and groundnut-chickpea systems, soil organic carbon declined. The groundnut-wheat system contributed more C, particularly root biomass C, than other systems, improved the restoration of soil organic carbon and maintained total system productivity. It was concluded that current fertilizer recommendations are adequate for maintaining yields in groundnut-based systems but the addition of crop residues at regular intervals along with fertilizer is necessary to maintain restoration of soil organic carbon.

AB 1. Plant virus diseases severely constrain agricultural production world-wide, especially in less developed countries. The use of resistant cultivars may put a selection pressure on the plant virus to evolve towards more aggressive types. We used a modelling approach to show the impact of resistance, expressed through different mechanisms, on selection for plant virus strains with a higher multiplication rate. Begomoviruses (Geminiviridae: Begomovirus) inducing leaf curl diseases on tomato were used as key examples.
   2. A model for the epidemiology of the plant-virus-vector system was combined with a model for the within-plant dynamics of the virus. Four types of resistance were defined, each expressing resistance through one or more model parameters. The evolutionary stable strategy (ESS) approach was used to study the effect of resistance on the evolution of within-plant virus multiplication rate.
   3. Resistance expressed through reduced virus acquisition by the vector, and resistance expressed through reduced inoculation of the plant, do not put a selection pressure on the virus to evolve towards a higher multiplication rate.
   4. Resistance expressed through reducing within-plant virus titre and symptom reducing resistance do put a selection pressure on the virus to evolve towards a higher multiplication rate.
   5. Synthesis and applications. We have shown how to disentangle different types of plant resistance. We have also shown that each type of resistance puts a different type of selection pressure on the virus. Virologists and plant breeders can use these results to develop methods to characterize the combination of resistance mechanisms in the cultivars they breed and, on the basis of this, determine whether the cultivar will put a selection pressure on the virus to evolve more harmful types. This new approach to plant resistance against virus diseases has been made possible by combining ecological insight in virus-vector-plant interactions with ESS calculations.

TI Fisheries exploitation pattern of narrow-barred Spanish mackerel,
   Scomberomorus commerson, in Oman and potential management options
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB A data base including length frequency distributions and catches of the Scomberomorus commerson in Oman according to fleet (gear/technique) and region has been established to carry out length cohort analyses, determine yield per recruit and simulate changes in fishing effort and/or increase in minimum length limit in catches. The analyse of data showed that: (i) The average fishing mortality rate is moderate (0.5-0.6), but acts in part on the juvenile fraction of the stock. The exploitation pattern differs, however, among fleets with some fleet components targeting largely immature kingfish and others largely the adult stock. (ii) An increase in total fishing effort would lead to long-term losses in total catch; the losses would be highest for fleets that target the larger specimens. A reduction of the effort would, in the long term, lead to an increase in yield and spawning stock biomass. (iii) An increase of minimum length limit in catches would, in the long term, lead to a substantial increase in yield and spawning stock biomass; the gain in catch would be largest for fleet components that target the adult fraction of the stock and (iv) an increase in minimum length limit in catches combined with an increased selectivity of the fisheries (i.e. favorising fleets targeting the adult fraction of the stock) would lead to the highest gain in sustainable catch. In this case, the sustainable catch could be increased by more than 50%. Therefore, this option represents the optimal management strategy obtained in the present study.

AB Recently, people pay more attention to overgrazing due to its extensive damaging effects on ecological systems. How to solve the remarkable problem is essentially an important topic. In this paper, setting the recovery period of plant population, we simulate the dynamics of rangeland grazing pattern with a mathematical model. Using the corresponding difference system determined by the model, we obtain the critical value of recovery period which is a ratio of the birth rate of grazer population during the grazing period to the sum of it and the death rate of grazer population during the recovery period. If the recovery period is above the critical value, the grazer population will become extinct; if the recovery period is below the critical value, we obtain the explicit expression of the positive periodic solution which is globally stable, i.e. two kinds of population are all persistent. Further, we find the maximum of grazer population's density when the density of grass population is not below a threshold. Our research demonstrates that properly timed grazing plays a key role in protecting grassland environment, or say, the recovery period of plant population is below the critical value; managed grazing is arguably the only natural process by which grassland can be improved on a sustainable basis. Controlled grazing can regenerate grassland, preserve healthy soil and improve livestock production simultaneously. Our results are valuable for rangeland grazing management in practice.

AB In this paper we investigate the optimal harvesting problems of a single species with Gompertz law of growth. Based on continuous harvesting models, we propose impulsive harvesting models with constant harvest or proportional harvest. By using the discrete dynamical systems determined by the stroboscopic map, we discuss existence, stability and global attractivity of positive periodic solutions, and obtain the maximum sustainable yield and the corresponding optimal population level. At last, we compare the maximum sustainable yield of impulsive harvest with that of continuous harvest, and point out that proportional harvest is superior to constant harvest.

To illustrate our main thesis we introduce two cases; first, Max Havelaar, a paradigmatic case of how business might function in an economy based upon solidarity and sustainability. Second, TINE, a Norwegian grocery corporation engaged in collusion in order to force a small competitor out of the market. On the one hand, in order to encourage market behaviour that integrates economic, societal and environmental values we find that transparent cooperation within a context of an organic worldview takes care of important intrinsic as well as instrumental values. On the other hand, we find evidence for asserting that cooperation based upon a mechanistic worldview, typically leads to group egotistical consequences undermining the long term common good.

AB This paper addresses questions of ethics in the professional practice of architecture. It begins by discussing possible relationships between ethics and aesthetics. It then theorises ethics within concepts of 'practice', and argues for the importance of the context in architecture where narrative can be used to learn and to integrate past and present experience. Narrative reflection also takes in the future, and in the case of architecture there is a positive but not yet well accepted move (particularly within the 'academy') to realise the imperative nature of architecture's responsibility with respect of global sustainability. Architects, more perhaps than other professions, use the faculty of imagination in their work, and this paper therefore maintains that architects as artists are uniquely qualified to exercise 'moral imagination' when it comes to situations where moral deliberation is needed. Pragmatism has given a new impetus to the importance of imagination in moral reflection, and I focus on John Dewey's categories of 'empathy' and 'dramatic rehearsal' as descriptors of moral imagination as applied in situations. I argue in conclusion firstly that empathy between end-users and architects is an essential but not always realised part of morality in architecture, and secondly that 'dramatic rehearsal', when extended more widely that a given situation, may lead architects to question the social, political and ecological contexts of their work and thus motivate them to prioritise the 'ethical' in all the choices they make.

DE energy saving; commercial building; Hong Kong
AB Along with the population and economic growth, and the associated expansion of the building stock, Hong Kong has shown a dramatic increase in energy consumption in recent years, particularly electricity use in commercial buildings. Over half of the electricity in Hong Kong is consumed by the commercial buildings, and heating, ventilation and air-conditioning(HVAC) is the largest end-user in such buildings. For the sake of environmental protection and sustainable development, some measures need take. In this study, the major factors influencing the electricity use of HVAC systems were studied with the building energy simulation program EnergyPlus, which include chiller efficiency, space cooling temperature, variable vs constant air flow, fan efficiency and lighting intensity. From the analysis of the simulation results, it can be found that great energy saving potential exists through improving the efficiency of using electricity in commercial buildings, especially the portion that is used for HVAC in such buildings, and a combination of desirable system parameters for energy efficiency of commercial building is proposed.

AB Townlet is the economic, cultural and political center within a limited rural area, so numeralization of these small towns provides an absolutely new means for their planning, constructing and management, and it is also an efficient way to ensure their sustainable development. With the support of COMGIS technology, an information system of pipeline network for townlet was introduced, which is based on SuperMap components whose development language is C#. After the character of the component and data organization were briefly introduced, some key technologies such as function modules of the system, logic architecture of the system and foundation of spatial database, were elaborated.

AB Urban land provides a suitable location for various economic activities which affect the development of surrounding areas. With rapid industrialization and urbanization, the contradictions in land-use become more noticeable. Urban administrators and decision-makers seek modern methods and technology to provide information support for urban growth. Recently, with the fast development of high-resolution sensor technology, more relevant data can be obtained, which is an advantage in studying the sustainable development of urban land-use. However, these data are only information sources and are a mixture of "information" and "noise". Processing, analysis and information extraction from remote sensing data is necessary to provide useful information. This paper extracts urban land-use information from a high-resolution image by using the multi-feature information of the image objects, and adopts an object-oriented image analysis approach and multi-scale image segmentation technology. A classification and extraction model is set up based on the multi-features of the image objects, in order to contribute to information for reasonable planning and effective management. This new image analysis approach offers a satisfactory solution for extracting information quickly and efficiently.

AB Aim. The research aimed to develop a sustainable and coordinated approach to facilitating the transition between diabetes services for adolescents. The objectives were to: (1) involve key diabetes health delivery stakeholders in expressing their concerns and issues about current service delivery and ways to improve same, and (2) reveal from the perspective of the adolescents living with Type 1 Diabetes their experiences surrounding the process of transition.
   Background. This paper presents research that sought to identify the major concerns and issues that stakeholders had about transition and to reveal the experience of transition for the adolescent with Type 1 Diabetes. Key representatives from seven public diabetes services in Adelaide, South Australia worked collaboratively to answer the objectives of this inquiry.
   Approach. Interview data were generated and analysed using a response focus framework provided by fourth generation evaluation research. In this study, the focus was on common concerns, claims and issues raised by health care professionals (n = 21) and adolescents (n = 10) aged between 15 and 18 years about transferring from children's to adult diabetes services.
   Findings. Data revealed education and dietetic advice was reactive rather than proactive and that the paediatric model of care is philosophically and practically different to the adult model of diabetes care. Three phases of transition were identified: preparation, formal transition and evaluation. Our findings indicated that these stages of transition were not being fully implemented in health units.
   Conclusion. The project findings have set the scene to establish a multidisciplinary working party to work collaboratively across agencies to develop effective transition pathways.
   Relevance to clinical practice. The role of diabetes nurse educators and dietitians in South Australia is under-used throughout the transition process. Diabetes nurse educators are in an ideal position to prepare, coordinate and evaluate transitional processes.

ID PEER; INFORMATION; TIME
AB This paper presents a model of microfinance lending to individuals that uses dynamic incentives, in the form of access to additional loans, to discourage borrowers from strategic default, or the unwillingness to repay a loan once a positive outcome is realized. We propose an improvement on contracts currently used by microfinance institutions (MFIs) by endogenizing the default penalty, while constraining the MFI to maintain sustainable lending operations. Furthermore, accounting for the risks that the poor face by including a negative economic shock, we show that under certain circumstances, the punishment for default need not be a lifetime without loans.

AB This study assessed the cost and effectiveness of a building-wide cockroach integrated pest management (IPM) program compared with bait alone treatment in public housing. In total, 12 buildings (66 apartments) were treated and monitored for cockroach infestations over 7 mo. The buildings were divided into two groups: bait treatment and IPM. Apartments in the bait alone group were treated with Maxforce FC Select (0.01% fipronil) during the first 12 wk and Maxforce Roach Killer Bait Gel (2.15% hydramethylnon) from 16 wk when necessary. For the IPM group, cockroaches were flushed and vacuumed at the beginning of the study; sticky traps were placed in all apartments to monitor and reduce cockroach numbers; educational materials were delivered to the residents; and Maxforce FC Select and Maxforce Roach Killer Bait Gel were applied to kill cockroaches. Two seminars were presented to the manger, and Community Service Program staff of the Gary Housing Authority to help gain tenant cooperation in the program. Effects of the treatments were monitored using sticky traps (six per apartment) at 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 29 wk after treatment. More treatments were applied during each monitoring visit when necessary. Those apartments with high levels of infestations (>= 12 cockroaches in six traps) before treatment were used to compare the IPM and bait only treatments. IPM resulted in significantly greater trap catch reduction than the bait treatment. The IPM (n = 12) and bait only treatment (n = 11) resulted in 100.0 and 94.6%, respectively, reduction in trap catch after 16 wk. At 29 wk, only one apartment in the IPM group had a high level (> 12 cockroaches) of cockroach infestation. In contrast, five apartments in the bait treatment group had high level infestations at 29 wk based on overnight trapping counts; thus, IPM is a more sustainable method of population reduction. Sanitation levels in the IPM group significantly improved at 29 wk (n = 11) compared with that at the beginning of the study. The sanitation levels in the bait treatment group, remained similar throughout the experiment (n = 9). The cumulative cost of IPM was significantly higher than that of the bait treatment. The median costs per apartment during 29 wk were $64.8 and $35.0 for the IPM and bait treatment, respectively. The median amount of bait used per apartment in the IPM and bait treatment was 45.0 and 50.0 g, respectively. The cost of the IPM group for the 29 wk service was similar to that of the bait treatment group. We expect that IPM will provide better control at similar cost compared with bait treatment beyond 29 wk.

DT Article
ID GOLD STANDARD
AB This article reassesses the importance of colonial status to investors before 1914 by means of multivariable regression analysis of the data available to contemporaries. We show that British colonies were able to borrow in London at significantly lower rates of interest than noncolonies precisely because of their colonial status, which mattered more than either gold standard adherence or the sustainability of fiscal policies. The "empire effect" was, on average, a discount of around 100 basis points, rising to around 175 basis points for the underdeveloped African and Asian colonies. Colonial status significantly reduced the default risk perceived by investors.

   global competitiveness; SWOT analysis; Analytic Hierarchy Process
AB The strategic importance of global competitiveness of the machine tool industry in Japan is steadily increasing, and therefore machine tool manufacturers require effective corporate strategy to achieve sustainable competitive advantages. Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) analysis is one of the most effective approaches used for analysing strategic management policy of an organization. However, the use of conventional SWOT analysis is based on the qualitative analysis and has no means of determining the importance of each SWOT factor. In this study, a newly structured SWOT analysis has been proposed for weighting and rating individual SWOT factors using the pairwise comparison matrices. As a result, effective industrial strategy planning for the machine tool industry can be carried out by applying the proposed method.

AB The essence of three case studies in relation to the global problem of surface and groundwater contamination by inorganic salts and biodegradation-resistant ("hard") nonionic surfactants (APEOs) is presented and the results analyzed as far as the long-term consequent water salt and APEO profiles are concerned. The main conclusion derived is that sustainable large-scale reuse/recycling and reclamation in semiarid zones requires a combined desalination-biological treatment of APEO-free sewage/wastewaters before their reuse. This should be done without delay in order to ensure the quality of the supplied water from the scarce resources and to avoid, most probably, an irreversible process of aquifer contamination in these zones.

AB Computer and information technologies have been used to support human activities towards sustainable development. Sustainable community activities are multi-disciplinary and multi-sectoral collaboration for solving environmental, economical and social problems in sustainable ways. However, the current supporting tools are independent and optimized to perform specific functions. This situation limits adaptability with respect to diversity and situational adaptation of sustainable community activities. The Web provides a foundation for supporting human activities and it helps users focus on the work they are trying to accomplish. This paper studies sustainable community activities and their relationships. Based on possible support to various activities, we propose a web-based support system for sustainable communities. It is hoped that the new system will satisfy the needs of sustainable communities.

ID SYSTEMS
AB Wastewater collection and treatment is quite important for sustainable management. It would be uneconomical and impractical to provide sewer systems and separate wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) for small communities. The decision process in wastewater planning is rather important in terms of comparing the alternatives considered. The two important points in the management of wastewater at rural areas not connected to a sewer system are to develop an optimized operation strategy and to make sure that the complete system is environmentally and economically sustainable. In some regions, package treatment could be an alternative solution. However, in cases where there is an existing large WWTP, a cluster system, where sewage generated by small communities could be transported via conveyors to a centralized WWTP, could be employed. In this study, the wastewater treatment and disposal problems in small communities were addressed and an alternative wastewater handling scenario was proposed. Additionally, three wastewater handling scenarios were compared. As a case study, Gebze villages were selected. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A system dynamics model based on the dynamic interactions among a number of system components is developed to estimate CO2 emissions from the cement industry in India. The CO2 emissions are projected to reach 396.89 million tonnes by the year 2020 if the existing cement making technological options are followed. Policy options of population growth stabilisation, energy conservation and structural management in cement manufacturing processes are incorporated for developing the CO2 mitigation scenarios. A 42% reduction in the CO2 emissions can be achieved in the year 2020 based on an integrated mitigation scenario. Indirect CO2 emissions from the transport of raw materials to the cement plants and finished product to market are also estimated. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID AGRICULTURAL-DEVELOPMENT; NITRATE; GROUNDWATER; INDICATORS
AB To ensure regional self-sufficiency and adequate rural livelihoods in the North China Plain (NCP), tremendous efforts were made over the last two decades by the Chinese government to raise the productivity of crops, despite increasing pressure on the land caused by a growing population. Emphasis was placed on high external input use, especially for wheat, maize and cotton, ignoring the particularities and limitations of the natural resource base. This study assesses the sustainability of current soil fertility management practices on the basis of selected location-specific indicators, such as fertilizer use, soil pH, soil organic matter content, levels of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) in the soil, and identifies determining factors of the yield and environmental impacts of inputs use. Data used for the analysis were gathered from soil tests, groundwater and chive plant tests, household surveys, and statistical yearbooks. Stepwise multiple regression analysis is applied to determine factors affecting the yields.
   The study revealed unbalanced use of nutrients. Organic fertilizers (manure, crop residues) and K are insufficiently applied, whereas N and P are considerably overused in comparison with recommended doses. The intensive cropping in the area using high-input technologies -particularly fertilizer- has resulted in a remarkable general enhancement of crop productivity and improvement of soil fertility over the years. The yield of wheat and maize has increased 173 and 180 kg ha(-1) annually from 1982 to 2000, respectively and soil fertility status also improved over the years and the values of the selected indicators are within the borderline for sustainability. Irrigation water, FYM application, and total labor used during the cultivation season (with the exception of cotton and chive) for production are the main factors determining the yields of four major crops under study, while popularly and overly used N did not appear to be a significant factor affecting the yield. Its overuse, however, leads to leaching of nitrate into groundwater and nitrate enrichment of vegetables. Of 20 groundwater samples, 16 showed nitrate levels between 55 and 180 mg l(-1), which exceeds recommendations for drinking water (<= 50 mg l(-1)), and 19 out of 20 chive plant samples had nitrate levels more than double the maximum permissible level of 700 mg kg(-1) which causes contamination of groundwater and vegetables.
   If the current methods of soil fertility management are continued, groundwater and food contamination will increase and jeopardize the sustainability of the current land use systems. Present soil fertility management practices at the farm level are not sustainable. However, there are possibilities to improve farmers' soil fertility Management practices, for instance, it is necessary to recommend soil and/or plant testing to adjust fertilizer and/or manure application rates to crops to reduce excessive nutrient input, and to adopt appropriate decision support systems for efficient and sustainable management of production resources.

DE consumption; growth; harvest; sustainability
AB In the United States we increasingly restrict wood production in the name of sustainability while going abroad for an ever larger share of the wood we consume, even though our own forest resources per capita are greater than the rest of the Earth. The unintended consequence is we transfer impacts of harvesting and consumption elsewhere. If we believe impacts of harvesting and consumption are primarily positive, we should embrace them locally. If we believe impacts are negative, we should take responsibility for them locally and mitigate them. Sustainable forest management requires scalable solutions across geopolitical units: states, regions, nations, and Earth. There are some simple measures of sustainability applicable across all these scales to establish sideboards for sustainable forest management.

DE biodiversity; indicators; sustainable forestry
AB Maintaining biodiversity is a primary goal of sustainable forestry. However, maintaining "life in all its forms" can be daunting to forest managers. "Biodiversity," as commonly defined, is simply too complex to measure or monitor. The only practical solution is to use indicators. In theory, good indicators are simple to measure and correlate with many other elements of biodiversity so they do not also have to be measured. All sustainable forestry programs use indicators; however, there is much confusion and frustration among forest managers and stakeholders about their usefulness. The primary limitation to selecting effective indicators has to do with process, not science. Here, we propose a framework for selecting biodiversity indictors that will better inform dedsionmakers and stakeholders.

TI PRAIRIE CROSSING CHARTER SCHOOL: COMFORT AS A PRINCIPAL COMPONENT OF
   HIGH PERFORMANCE SCHOOL DESIGN
SO JOURNAL OF GREEN BUILDING
LA English
DT Article
AB The design and construction of sustainable buildings has had an evolving motivation. Initially, sustainable design was guided almost wholly by a desire of a few to minimize the environmental footprint of our buildings. Yet as sustainable design became better understood, the economic benefits of sustainable strategies have become an increasing motivation for many owners. For some, the focus is on the returns provided by decreased maintenance and operation costs, while for others the increase in worker productivity-through decreased absenteeism, a reduction in errors, and overall gains in worker output-is beginning to drive the decision-making process. But when we are talking about an educational environment, we are not talking about workers producing, but instead are concerned about children learning. Yet the fundamental goal of each remains similar: by providing comfortable, healthy environments designers can remove the impediments to productivity or learning directly attributable to our built environment.
   If we think specifically about schools, careful consideration to comfort is even more important than in a commercial setting precisely because of the primary occupants. School-aged children have lower body masses and are, therefore, more susceptible to many of the factors addressed by the design: allergens being distributed or accumulated in a building, toxins being released by building materials, and unwanted changes in indoor air temperature. In addition, children are more susceptible to breaks in concentration caused by environmental factors like those named above as well as changes in noise levels or illumination. Such disruption directly affects students' ability to focus on and retain their lessons.
   So while there is a greater body of evidence focused on worker productivity in sustainable buildings, the most cost-effective green building strategies for schools should focus on maintaining the highest level of comfort for their primary occupants-children. By considering comfort, sustainable strategies can be employed that directly affect the learning of students. As registered architects and engineers, we are required to maintain basic human health and welfare in school design, but few of us use student comfort as an overriding design principle that crosses all facets of the project design.
   Prairie Crossing Charter School (PCCS), a new school in Grayslake, Illinois, was designed with just such a thought process. The school building is an addition to an existing campus and was programmed to include only classrooms (no offices, cafeteria, or gymnasium).
   The surrounding buildings include a historical one-room schoolhouse and a barn with grain silo set in a new housing development with styling modeled on traditional Midwest farmhouses. It is a community that values environmental protection and enhancement, a sense of place, and a sense of neighborhood. As such, they wanted their school to reflect those goals and aesthetics, while providing a premier learning environment for their children. The following outlines the specific goals identified as key to student comfort and the specific strategies used in pursuit of those goals.

TI FOUNDATIONS-THE BASE OF SUSTAINABLE RESIDENTIAL BUILDING DESIGN
SO JOURNAL OF GREEN BUILDING
LA English
DT Article
AB The foundation is perhaps a buildings most challenging envelope component from energy transport and hygrothermal perspectives. As such, the foundation literally provides the energy and materials basis on which the sustainability of the entire structure depends from a number of perspectives. The foundation can account for as much as 40% of the building envelope conduction loss and, more importantly, in unoccupied conditions, almost all of the latent load (or energy required for dehumidification). From a materials perspective, the foundation has to provide a durable interface between the surrounding ground and the building interior in the presence of bulk water soil gasses (such as radon, water vapor, and even, on occasion, hydrogen sulphide), frost, biotic activity, and pest infestation while simultaneously being the buildings structural basis. From an energy perspective, the foundation must insulate the interior from the surrounding soil and ambient environment, and provide an interior surface temperature producing comfortable conditions for the occupants while minimizing both sensible and latent thermal loads to the greatest possible extent.
   Achieving all these requirements in a cost-competitive residential housing market is difficult. Certainly national residential building codes such as the International Residential Code (IRC) and the International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) do provide a least common denominator basis for building adequate foundations, but they do not go nearly far enough fro m a sustainability perspective, particularly in light of twenty-first century energy prerogatives. It is reasonable to state that these codes are a generation or two behind what would be an appropriate building regulatory policy for the current times, namely, that residential buildings in particular should be built to a zero net energy standard (that is, no net energy importation across the property line for a given calendar year). The technology to accomplish this standard does exist and is being demonstrated by agencies such as the United States Department of Energy (DOE).
   It is in this context that the State of Minnesota recently undertook a major revision of the foundation rules in its state energy code. The revision was prompted by widespread failures of foundation systems across the state, largely as a consequence of biotic activity caused by condensation within foundation wall assemblies. An example of the condensation that can be produced by wall assemblies compliant with Minnesota Rules chapter 7672.0600 is shown in Figure 1.
   The energy code foundation rules revision was guided by the principle that the code rules must have an experimentally validated basis in the physics of building foundation beat and mass transport. The resultant rule as currently expressed in the public review draft (at the time of writing) has made significant progress in establishing a well-founded basis for constructing durable foundation systems that can fulfill the requirements of material and energy sustainability. Because the rule is centered on a set of generalized building envelope hygrothermal performance criteria, the rule is not limited to foundations in a cold climate, but is applicable to the entire envelope in all terrestrial climates.

TI TOWARDS A SUSTAINABLE CITY CENTRE: INTEGRATING ECOLOGICALLY SUSTAINABLE
   DEVELOPMENT (ESD) PRINCIPLES INTO URBAN RENEWAL
SO JOURNAL OF GREEN BUILDING
LA English
DT Article
DE urban principles for Ecologically Sustainable Development (ESD); energy
   consumption; global warming; density; solar orientation; eco-buildings;
   case study; Newcastle City Centre; the 'SolarCity' project
AB This paper reflects upon a wide range of strategies focused on increasing sustainability of urban design beyond and within the scope of individual buildings. By examining the case study of the Australian city of Newcastle, the paper provides a context for a general debate about the urban design of a sustainable city centre, and discusses bow urban design is affected (and can be expected to be even more affected in future) by the new paradigms of ecology.
   In this context, the author presents the case study of 'SolarCity', which is based on a vision for the revitalisation of Newcastle's city centre. It is an in-progress research and demonstration project, involving Australian and German architects, engineers and industry partners. It deals with cross-cutting issues in architecture and urban design and addresses the question: How to best cohesively integrate all aspects of energy systems, transport systems, waste and water management, climatisation, etc., into contemporary urban design and the environmental performance of eco-buildings?
   The 'SolarCity' project encapsulates a vision based on the belief that urban revitalisation can be achieved and facilitated through the use of sustainable urban design principles. Consequently, this paper addresses the fundamentals of urban sustainability, such as orientation to the sun, and general strategies for more compact communities. As we begin to fully understand the consequences of our dependency on fossil energy and the automobile, the cost of mobility, and ways to integrate sustainability systems into buildings, it becomes apparent that the common knowledge of aesthetics of urban composition is no longer sufficient.

TI GREEN BUILDING IN THE RUSSIAN CONTEXT: AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE
   ESTABLISHMENT OF A LEED (R)-BASED GREEN BUILDING RATING SYSTEM IN THE
   RUSSIAN FEDERATION
SO JOURNAL OF GREEN BUILDING
LA English
DT Article
AB Given the tremendous impact of buildings on the ecosystem, the Russian Federation (RF) is under pressure to become more ecologically sound in its building construction and operation practices. Under the same pressure, several other countries that have been less explicit about their environmental commitment than the RF have established green building rating systems (GBRSs) like LEED (R) of the US Green Building Council. This diagnostic pilot study investigated why there is no such system in the RF expecting that there are potent contextual impediments to it. The study was designed as a fluid interaction between archival ethnographic research and in-depth qualitative interviews. Its preliminary phase assessed the introduction and adaptation of LEED (R) in five non-US contexts. The primary investigation involved in-depth interviewing of representatives of five major stakeholder sectors in three bioregionally, socio-politically and economically different Russian cities: Moscow, St. Petersburg and Novosibirsk.
   The results suggest that prevalence of one-sided and short-sighted decision-making, lack of information, the cost of "green," inadequate regulatory system and all-prevailing fragmentation are the most acknowledged impediments to green building in the RE Impediments are perceived differently by the various industry sectors and vary with geographic location of the stakeholders. The results were translated into several adjustments of LEED (R) that counteract the conflicting paradigms and impeding forces of the context and capitalize on contextual assets laden in the Russian history, vernacular tradition and mentality to make the resulting GBRS viable in the Russian context.
   The study provides a comprehensive assessment of factors that influence the establishment of a GBRS in the RF captures tacit knowledge and contributes to the understanding of a cross-cultural adaptation of market mechanisms. In addition, it may provide insight into transition economies as a whole, by exposing the springboards and impediments to sustainable building practices that they share.

TI ENERGY AND WATER SUSTAINABILITY: THE ROLE OF URBAN CLIMATE CHANGE FROM
   METROPOLITAN INFRASTRUCTURE
SO JOURNAL OF GREEN BUILDING
LA English
DT Article
DE Urban Heat Island; electricity; water; metropolitan; infrastructure;
   urbanization; sustainability
AB As recently as 1950, 30% of the worlds population lived in urban areas. By the year 2030, 60% of the world population will live in cities. The science of sustainable development requires the ability to examine and understand the implications of broad and aggregate impacts. This is even more difficult in rapidly urbanizing regions globally where the pace of change itself becomes part of what has to be taken into account in engineering designs, modeling, planning, and policy development. Urbanization is quickly transitioning communities from native vegetation to man-made urban engineered infrastructure. Anthropogenic changes in the characteristics of the land surface can have a marked impact on the partitioning of energy at the surface. This is often manifested in microscale and mesoscale modifications to the thermal properties of the surface and atmosphere and can result in significant increases in temperatures in comparison to adjacent rural regions which, is known as the Urban Heat Island Effect (Urban Heat Island or UHI). The UHI is understood in theory, but its practical engineering and policy implications resist interpretation due to the variations in social economic and environmental conditions in a given region at a given time.
   The findings of this research indicate that the thermal modifications to the climate as result of urbanization have impacted the sustainability of the Phoenix, Arizona region. Overall HVAC electrical consumption for a representative 2, 000 ft(2) has increased from 7,888 kWh per year in the 1950's to over 8,873 kWh per year in the 1990's. This also impacts water supply in the and region as the research finds 6,550 gallons of water is consumed by household for HVAC electricity consumption.(5)

TI DETERMINING CONSTRUCTION DEBRIS RECYCLING DUMPSTER DENSITIES
SO JOURNAL OF GREEN BUILDING
LA English
DT Article
AB Solid waste generated by construction and demolition (C&D) projects account for a significant portion of solid waste generated and landfilled in the United States. The United States Green Building Council (USGBC) Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED (R)) credit system encourages recycling of C&D debris. Data from a new construction project adhering to LEED (R) guidelines is used to investigate dumpster densities for construction debris. These are conversion factors from waste collection volumes to waste masses useful for verification of recycling credit goals, estimating waste management needs and optimizing waste management costs. The proper estimation of waste material dumpster density is important in order to combine sustainability with cost effectiveness.
   The field data was generated from a 9700 m(2) (104,000 ft(2)) building under construction in Columbia, South Carolina with a precast concrete and brick veneer. The categories of waste investigated were general trash, masonry, wood steel and sheetrock. It was found that there are significant differences in many of the conversion factors for this project as compared to factors from other waste material recycling databases.

TI CASE STUDY VALIDATION OF THE CONTINUOUS VALUE ENHANCEMENT PROCESS
SO JOURNAL OF GREEN BUILDING
LA English
DT Article
DE sustainable development; constructability; value engineering
AB Sustainable building projects have levels of complexity over conventional building projects that challenge current project management tools at efficiently managing the rigors of sustainable projects. The Continuous Value Enhancement Process (CVEP) is a recently developed tool designed specifically for sustainable building projects. This project management tool enables project teams to systematically generate and evaluate project alternatives for meeting sustainable goals. The goal of this tool is to identify high performance solutions that increase levels of sustainability and improve project performance. CVEP was experimentally implemented and tested on four case study projects to evaluate its ability to support project management decision making in ways that elevate sustainability and project performance. Reported in this paper, the results show CVEP produced first cost and life cycle cost savings. In particular, the study confirms that CVEP has the capability to: 1.) Provide a systematic evaluation process, 2.) Collect high performance building solutions, and 3.) Be applicable to different project types. These results show that it is possible to employ targeted project management techniques, like CVEP to improve the cost-effective provision of sustainable buildings.

AB This article analyzes the environmental effects of resource consumption at a subnational level (by Cardiff, the capital city of Wales), using the Ecological Footprint as a measure of impact assessment. The article begins by providing a short critique of the Footprint methodology and the limitations of methods traditionally used to calculate national Footprint accounts. We then describe the Footprint methodology developed by the Stockholm Environment Institute to overcome some of these problems and used as the basis of the Reducing Wales' Ecological Footprint project, of which the Cardiff study has been a part. The main portion of this article focuses on presenting and discussing the Footprint results for Cardiff. The Ecological Footprint of household consumption in Cardiff will be presented using the international Classification of Individual Consumption According to Purpose (COICOP). Based on the results, we found that the areas of consumption that are a priority for Cardiff in terms of reducing resource use are food and drink, passenger transport (car and aviation), domestic fuel consumption, waste, and tourism. We also discuss how these findings have been presented to the Cardiff Council. We report on the initial reactions of policy officers to the Footprint results and how the Council plans to use them to influence policy decisions relating to sustainability. Finally, in the Conclusions section, we briefly explain the value of applying the Ecological Footprint at a subnational level and its value as an evidence-based tool for sustainability decision making.

   national accounts matrix including environmental accounts (NAMEA);
   sustainable resource use; total material requirement (TMR)
AB In a German case study, environmental input-output analyses (eIOA) combined with NAMEA-type tables were conducted for eleven selected environmental pressure variables. (NAMEA is an acronym for national accounts matrix including environmental accounts.) The analyses were conducted to derive the production-cycle-wide resource use and environmental impact potentials of final-demand product groups. The methodology permits identification and preliminary ranking of 10 product chains along which about two-thirds of German production-born environmental pressures arise. The most relevant product groups are construction work, food, motor vehicles, basic metals, and electricity. The ten product groups are characterized by both high resource requirements and high residual outputs (air emissions, wastes). The EU policy areas of integrated product policy and sustainable use of natural resources may address these product chains as a priority in order to identify and explore the possibility of reducing the environmental impacts from products throughout their life cycles and to decouple environmental impacts from resource use.

   (NOx); sulfur dioxide (SO2); consumption structural path analysis
ID ENERGY-REQUIREMENTS; SUSTAINABLE CONSUMPTION; INVENTORIES; EMISSIONS
AB A promising way to reduce environmental impacts of consumer expenditure is through the encouragement of more sustainable consumption patterns. Consumers cause environmental impacts both directly, such as by fuel use in personal cars, and indirectly, by paying for the production of consumables. With increased international trade, the indirect environmental impacts are difficult to determine because a portion of the emissions occurs in different geographical regions. Many previous studies have unrealistically assumed that imports are produced using domestic production technology. For countries with diverging technology and energy mixes the likely errors are significant. This study applies a methodology that explicitly includes technology differences to the case of Norwegian households. It is found that a significant portion of pollution is embodied in Norwegian household imports. Further, a disproportionately large amount of pollution is embodied in imports from developing countries. Overall, as in previous studies, we find that mobility and food are most important in terms of household environmental impacts. By analyzing the imports in more detail we find that for some sectors the majority of emissions occur in foreign regions; in particular, this is true for food, business services, clothing, chemicals, furniture, cars, agriculture, textiles, and most manufactured products.

ID CONSUMPTION
AB The 1990s policy trend of intervening at the specification level over a broad range of products has ended. Today's environmental product policies focus, rather, on a few arbitrary product groups. Selectiveness should serve absolute environmental impact reduction, which asks for a rational product-selection and target framework. The authors propose "life-cycle impact per consumer expenditure" as a key criterion. This criterion helps to connect macro environmental impact reduction aims with product innovation targets, even under continuous economic growth, consumption pattern shifts, and rebound threats. The authors analyze the Dutch economy as an exercise. This results in 44 product groups, labeled "Hyenas" by the authors, that need to improve their ratio score drastically between now and 2040. Some magnitudes of desired change are given. Finally, intervention processes at the Hyena group level along the lines of sustainable transition management are proposed. joint visioning, experimental portfolios, interaction between micro, meso, and macro change levels, and gradual pressure building are crucial elements in this concept of complex change management.

AB Environmental effects of economic activities are ultimately driven by consumption, via impacts of the production, use, and waste management phases of products and services ultimately consumed. Integrated product policy (IPP) addressing the life-cycle impacts of products forms an innovative new generation of environmental policy Yet this policy requires insight into the final consumption expenditures and related products that have the greatest life-cycle environmental impacts. This review article brings together the conclusions of 11 studies that analyze the life-cycle impacts of total societal consumption and the relative importance of different final consumption categories, This review addresses in general studies that were included in the project Environmental Impacts of Products (EIPRO) of the European Union (EU), which form the basis of this special issue. Unlike most studies done in the past 25 years on similar topics, the studies reviewed here covered a broad set of environmental impacts beyond just energy use or carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. The studies differed greatly in basic approach (extrapolating LCA data to impacts of consumption categories versus approaches based on environmentally extended input-output (EEIO) tables), geographical region, disaggregation of final demand, data inventory used, and method of impact assessment. Nevertheless, across all studies a limited number of priorities emerged. The three main priorities, housing, transport, and food, are responsible for 70% of the environmental impacts in most categories, although covering only 55% of the final expenditure in the 25 countries that currently make up the EU. At a more detailed level, priorities are car and most probably air travel within transport, meat and dairy within food, and building structures, heating, and (electrical) energy-using products within housing. Expenditures on clothing, communication, health care, and education are considerably less important. Given the very different approaches followed in each of the sources reviewed, this result hence must be regarded as extremely robust. Recommendations are given to harmonize and improve the methodological approaches of such analyses, for instance, with regard to modeling of imports, inclusion of capital goods, and making an explicit distinction between household and government expenditure.

AB The intention of this essay is to point out the key weaknesses of the resource-based view (RBV) and provide prescriptions for curing them. The authors begin with Gibbert's (this issue) question of whether the RBV is ready for generalization and concluded generalizability is an inappropriate goal for the RBV Furthermore, they believe that the RBV is simply not ready for generalization. They argue that the quest for generalizability is counterproductive when applied to the RBV Generalizability is not only the least relevant of the external validity criteria but also can only be assessed after valid operationalizations for constructs are developed across different contexts, industries, samples, and so on. Because they believe that RBV researchers have yet to achieve construct validity within their empirical testing, it appears to them that the RBV is simply not ready for generalizability. Finally, when they incorporate RBV developments that have occurred since Barney such as the knowledge-based view and dynamic capabilities, many arguments by Gibbert and others are rendered obsolete.

AB The oscillatory characteristics and dynamic structure of periodic flow in an oscillatory gas flow meter were studied experimentally and numerically. The flow oscillations were triggered by the Coanda effect and an universal correlation between Strouhal number and Reynolds number, Str = 1.09 x 10(-3) for Re-HD > 800, was deduced based on spectral analysis of the pressure fluctuations in the flow channel. Numerical Simulation indicated that the evolution of the flow patterns was classified into stages of induction and sustainable periodic oscillation. The transformation between the two stages was noticeably affected by the design of the feedback channels. The results further revealed that the development of the main vortex in the oscillating chamber and the small vortices at the entrance of the feedback channels concurrently modulate the mechanism of oscillation. The small vortices located at both entrances of the feedback channels play the role of a pair of modulating valves, which alternatively switch on and off the bypass flow through each feedback channel, thus reinforcing the periodic oscillation.

TI The neuronal, synaptic self: having values and making choices
SO JOURNAL OF MORAL EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Given that many in neuroscience believe all human experience will eventually be accounted for in terms of the activity of the brain, does the concept of moral or values education make sense? And, are we not headed for a singly deterministic notion of the self, devoid of even the possibility of making choices? One obvious objection is that this does not tally with our experience - we can espouse values and do make choices. But perhaps this is simply appearance and the language of values and choices belongs to a previous age and is no longer sustainable. Perhaps the way in which we encounter other selves and account for their actions as moral agents is simply outdated. We need to begin to address others, including the children we teach, as neuronal selves and account for their actions as neuronally determined. This paper will argue that espousing the notion that we are neuronal selves need not lead to such pessimistic reductionistic conclusions. If we can no longer believe in Cartesian dualism we do not have take a leap into materialism that threatens to reduce our being to that of robots. A neuroscience that recognises that we are multileveled psychosomatic neuronal selves can point the way out of this dilemma. Values in education then not only make sense: they are more pivotal than hitherto imagined.

AB Anemia and co-existing deficiencies of zinc, iron, iodine, and vitamin A occur among children in many developing countries including NE Thailand, probably contributing to impairments in growth, immune competence, and cognition. Sustainable strategies are urgently required to combat these deficiencies. We assessed the efficacy of a micronutrient-fortified seasoning powder served with a school lunch on reducing anemia and improving the micronutrient status of rural NE Thai children. Children (n = 569) aged 5.5-13.4y from 10 schools were randomly assigned to receive a seasoning powder either unfortified or fortified with zinc (5 mg), iron (5 mg), vitamin A (270 mu g), and iodine (50 mu g) (per serving) and incorporated into a school lunch prepared centrally and delivered 5 d/wk for 31 wk. Teachers monitored school lunch consumption. Baseline and final micronutrient status, hemoglobinopathies, and infection or inflammation were assessed from blood and urine samples. For the primary outcome, anemia (based on hemoglobin), no intervention effect was apparent (odds ratio: 1.02 95% CI: 0.69, 1.51) after adjustment for design strata. The odds of zinc (based on serum zinc) and urinary iodine deficiency in the fortified group were 0.63 (0.42, 0.94) and 0.52 (0.38, 0.71) times those in the unfortified group, respectively. Fortification had no effect on serum retinol (0.61: 0.25,1.51), ferritin (1.12: 0.43, 2.96), or mean red cell volume (1.16: 0.82, 1.64). Therefore, a micronutrient-fortified seasoning powder is a promising vehicle for improving zinc, iodine, and hemoglobin status, and its potential for incorporation into lunch programs in day care centers and schools in NE Thailand warrants investigation.

AB An insecticide resistance management (IRM) strategy was devised and evaluated for the management of cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera (Lep., Noctuidae) in cotton in on-farm research in Punjab state, India, in 2003-2004. The adoption of the IRM programme, based mainly on economic thresholds and on the use of selectively acting insecticides, resulted in significantly lower incidence of cotton bollworms and of homopteran pests in conjunction with a reduced use of insecticides. Beneficials (predatory bugs and spiders) tended to be more frequent. The number of insecticide sprays per season in IRM plots (9.5) was less than in non-IRM plots (14.5). Laboratory tests showed that the IRM strategy resulted in a significant decline (1 to 2.9-fold) in resistance of H. armigera larvae to cypermethrin, fenvalerate, endosulfan, methomyl, quinalphos and chlorpyriphos. A significant cotton yield increase of 28.7% (0.62 t/ha) was observed. The economic analysis showed a net return of $ 291.3/ha in IRM plots compared to non-IRM plots but the costs of advice and scouting are not included here. The results demonstrated the superiority of IRM strategy over the present farmer's practice (unnecessary use of insecticides, practically no monitoring), and thus help in reviving the confidence of traditional cotton growers in a more sustainable cotton cultivation.

AB Citrus growing in humid, tropical India is concentrated in east to northeast India. The region is well known for large-scale commercial cultivation of Citrus reticulata Blanco, cultivar 'Khasi,' mandarin. Extensive surveys were conducted covering as many as 108 orchards from 52 locations representing eight states, namely West Bengal, Sikkim, Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, Mizoram, Arunachal Pradesh, and Manipur. Expressed in milligrams per kilogram, the optimum values for available nutrients in soil were determined to be as: nitrogen (N) (220.8-240.6), phosphorus (P) (21.2-45.6), potassium (K) (252.2-300.8), calcium (Ca) (278.1-318.6), magnesium (Mg) (67.2-92.5), iron (Fe) (82.2-114.6), manganese (Mn) (21.4-32.8), copper (Cu) (0.82-2.62), and zinc (Zn) (2.18-4.22) using multivariate quadratic regression analysis. The corresponding leaf-nutrient values, expressed in percent, were: N (2.23-2.49), P (0.10-0.11), K (1.86-2.12), Ca (2.12-2.32), and Mg (0.28-0.38), and in ppm were Fe (148.2-179.8), Mn (72.2-84.8), Cu (10.4-18.6), and Zn (24.2-38.8). These reference values of soil and leaf analysis were later observed to be well within the range of values obtained for high-performance orchards (45-62 kg tree(-1)), confirming the hypothesis that soil fertility and leaf nutrient levels maintained under high yielding orchards could be used provisionally as nutrient diagnostics. Nutrient constraints in the form of N, P, Ca, Mg, Cu, and Zn were identified using these diagnostics, which deserve a place in a fertilizer program of mandarin orchards of the region to obtain sustainable optimum fruit yield.

AB Data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics three cross-sectional National Health Surveys, conducted in 1989-1990, 1995-1996 and 2000, were used to examine long-term population responses to the 1996 physical activity (PA) recommendations. Past 2-week recall of the number of times and total minutes spent walking for recreation or sport, and doing moderate and vigorous exercise, were averaged for 1 week to create a measure of 'sufficiently active': >= 5 weekly sessions of >= 150min/week of at least moderate-intensity activity. With the exception of adults aged > 60 years, from 1989 to 2000, there were increases in the prevalence of walking (+8%) and in moderate-intensity exercise (+4%), resulting in a significant decline (-6%) in the proportion of those reporting no leisure-time exercise. Participation in vigorous exercise remained unchanged. There was a 'population shift' in median minutes and sessions of walking from 1995 to 2000, but the prevalence of regular walking (>= 5 times and >= 150min/week) remained unchanged. A small but significant increase (+2%) in the proportion of adults who met the PA recommendations was noted mainly for men under 60 years and for women aged 45-59 years. The proportion meeting the PA recommendations declined significantly in the most socioeconomically disadvantaged area. These data provide evidence contrary to the observed declines in PA documented by the Active Australia surveillance in the late 1990s. The population may have responded to the 1996 concept of moderate-intensity exercise mainly by walking, but sustainable promotional efforts will be required to build on these gains in the forthcoming decades.

AB For high-velocity running or swimming, the relationship between velocity (v) and its sustainable duration (t) can be described by a hyperbolic relationship: (v-V-crit) . t = D', where V-crit is termed critical velocity, and D' is defined as a curvature constant of the hyperbolic curve. The purposes of this study were to examine whether the V-crit could be applied to evaluate short-distance breaststroke swimming performance and to evaluate the relative contribution of D' in short-distance swimming performance. Eleven male swimmers performed a series of time trials corresponding to 75, 100, and 150-m in an indoor 50-m swimming pool. The observed records were calculated into average velocities of each event to determine V-crit and D'. After the determination of V-crit and D', all subjects performed 50-m time trial on another day. A maximal anaerobic power test using cycle ergometer was also performed in the laboratory. The average velocity of the 50- m time trial significantly correlated with the obtained V-crit, but not with D'. D' was significantly correlated with the residual error, calculated from the regression analysis for the relationship between V-crit and the average velocities of 50- m time trial. A cluster analysis showed that most of the subjects were classified as V-crit dependency when performing 50- m time trial. Those results indicated that V-crit could be applied to evaluate short-distance swimming performance, and it determined around 80% of the short-distance breaststroke swimming performance.

AB Preannouncements are strategic marketing communications directed at market participants including investors, suppliers, distributors, and buyers. Most empirical literature focuses on antecedents influencing a firm's preannouncement behavior and on outcomes related to deleterious responses by competitors. This study differs and follows the large body of extant research that examines preannouncing behavior as a deliberate marketing communication process aimed at influencing market participants in the firm's favor. The authors develop and test a model of preannouncement behavior that affects the success of a new product launch through market anticipation, competitive equity, and new product development resources. The findings indicate that preannouncement behavior engenders new product success through its positive effect on market anticipation-a favorable industry-wide bias in advance of new product introduction-and emphasizes the use of preannouncements as business-to-business marketing communications aimed at influencing current and prospective supply chain partners in the firm's favor.

AB Many authors have reported that biopolymers can be formed from enzymatic crosslinking between dissimilar proteins. It was shown that these products have the advantage of possessing the unique properties of each contributing protein and, at the same time, have the potential for generating innovative products. In this present study, we examined separately the properties of microbial transglutaminase-modified proteins, specifically gelatin, whey, and whey protein isolate (WPI), as well as their enzymatically-combined products. The physical properties and molecular weight distribution of the gelatin biopolymers show that the products had higher melting points, viscosities, and molecular weight distributions, and the degree of crosslinking was enhanced by addition of even small amounts of the secondary protein. There is potential that these products from relatively inexpensive sustainable resources may be used as fillers or as coatings in leather processing. To that end, we carried out a filling experiment, using labeled proteins, and showed that the proteins were evenly distributed throughout the hide and, more importantly, were bound and not removed during the washing steps.

AB Objectives: This paper examines nursing staff's perspectives on the utility and sustainability of a clinical pathway for treating nursing home residents with pneumonia.
   Design: A qualitative (case study) design was used
   Setting: Data were collected from 6 nursing homes in Southern Ontario (5 from metro regions and 1 from a nonmetro region). Nursing homes were drawn from a larger randomized controlled trial of a clinical pathway for nursing home-acquired pneumonia conducted between 2001 and 2005. The clinical pathway was designed to assist in the identification, diagnosis, and management of pneumonia, including a decision tool for determining the appropriate location of treatment (hospital versus nursing home).
   Participants: A total of 7 focus groups and 1 one-on-one interview were conducted between February 2003 and May 2004. Interview data were analyzed using the template style, described by Miller and Crabtree, to identify key themes.
   Findings: Nurses strongly supported the idea of the clinical pathway and believed that providing pneumonia care in the nursing home was better for the resident. As a result of using the clinical pathway, nurses felt that pneumonia was being identified, diagnosed, and treated earlier, resulting in fewer hospitalizations. In addition to the benefits to resident care, the nurses felt that their skills and knowledge also improved. Nurses generally supported the implementation of the pathway although some concern was expressed about the additional responsibility and resources that would entail.
   Conclusions:The implementation of a clinical pathway for treating pneumonia in nursing homes and quick access to a backup clinician are desired by nurses who also believe it will result in better care and fewer hospitalizations of residents.

AB Objectives: This paper examines the utility and sustainability of a clinical pathway for treating nursing home residents with pneumonia from the perspective of nursing administrators and medical directors in Ontario, Canada. The discussion includes a comparison of the perspectives of the administrators and the nursing staff (reported in part I of this article).
   Design: A qualitative case study design was used.
   Setting: Data were collected from 6 nursing homes in Southern Ontario that were drawn from a larger randomized controlled trial of a clinical pathway to help identify, diagnose, and manage cases of nursing home-acquired pneumonia.
   Participants: Six interviews were conducted with nursing administrators and 2 with medical directors (1 per facility). Key themes were identified in the interview data using the template style of analysis described by Miller and Crabtree.
   Findings: Administrators were in favor of using a clinical pathway for identifying and treating pneumonia in nursing home residents. Participants thought that during the study residents with pneumonia received better and more timely care, and that nurses' clinical skills, knowledge, and confidence had improved. In comparison with views expressed by nurses and medical directors in the same facilities, nursing administrators tended to report less clinical training and staff support were required to successfully implement the pathway.
   Conclusions: Even though nurses and administrators strongly support the use of a pneumonia clinical pathway in nursing homes, implementation plans should be tailored to individual facilities and be informed by the perspectives of both administrators and staff.

SO JOURNAL OF TROPICAL PEDIATRICS

ID DEATHS
AB A needs assessment at Tansen Mission Hospital established gaps in knowledge, skills and attitudes of health professionals, contributing to the high neonatal mortality in Nepal. This study was designed to implement and evaluate the effectiveness of an educational program in Newborn Care, using best evidence teaching methods and content. Pre intervention, an audit of newborn care practices and documentation was performed using a structured checklist. Intervention consisted of four teaching sessions each involving short lectures and interactive skills stations. Post intervention, participant satisfaction, knowledge, competence and performance were evaluated. In 80 per cent of responses (n=30), participants evaluated the program as very good or excellent. Matched pair pre and post education MCQ scores compared knowledge, with significant improvement in all groups (nurses, doctors and community health workers). Competence was evaluated by an Objective Structured Clinical Examination with mean scores (+/- SD) ranging from 65 per cent (7.0) to 87 per cent (7.3). Performance was examined by pre and post-intervention audit of records. Significant changes in practice included a 100 per cent increase in measuring length and head circumference, charting percentiles and documentation of structured history and examination in the Newborn Care Notes. Administration of vitamin K at birth increased by 71 per cent, assessment of hypoglycaemia risk by 94 per cent and those at risk of hypoglycaemia having a blood sugar level measured increased by 58 per cent. These results led to consideration of appointment of a postgraduate educator. Even with limitations in educating and implementing change in a resource limited rural setting, a short, interactive education program can have positive educational outcomes and can change practice. Sustainability is dependant on staff employing continuing education.

AB Because the term "malaria control" specifies an anti-malaria activity rather than an outcome of that action, progress has been evaluated in terms of the effort expended. Plans that specify goals and time lines tend to lack irreversible endpoints. Anti-malaria interventions that are stimulated by economic considerations focus on sites in which the residents enjoy some employment advantage, while interventions based on humanitarian objectives serve the neediest residents of broad regions. Site-specific interventions are conducted by industrial or municipal agencies. while regional interventions are conducted by public agencies. Industry contributes an element of sustainability by injecting the possibility of gainful employment into the site. Efforts that distribute assets mainly to the richest-of-the-poor may fail to preserve lives that would otherwise have been preserved, while those that serve the poorest-of-the-poor may fail to create sustainable cycles of health and wealth. Progress in relieving the burden imposed by malaria requires economically motivated as well as humanitarian contributions, and both should specify realistically time-limited goals that ultimately permit deintensification.

AB The resource-based view (RBV) of the firm suggests that strategic deployment of capabilities allows strategic business units (SBUs) to exploit distinctive competencies and create sustainable competitive advantage. Following the RBV, we propose a new predictive methodology for deriving typologies of SBUs that accommodates heterogeneity among SBUs with respect to their strategic capabilities, how effectively they are employed, and performance. Statistically, we devise a constrained finite-mixture structural-equation procedure that simultaneously accounts for firm capabilities, performance outcomes, and the relationships between them. The procedure allows for a comprehensive modeling and grouping of entities, and simultaneously provides a diagnosis of the sources of heterogeneity via the flexibility of estimating a series of nested models. Managerially, our proposed methodology is grounded in the strategic type and RBV literature and can capture the effects of environmental and industry-specific factors. Using data obtained from 216 SBUs in the United States for illustration, the results show that our derived four mixed-type solution dominates the four-group, Prospectors-Analyzers-Defenders-Reactors classification as well as a number of other nested model solutions in terms of objective statistical fit criteria for this data set, suggesting a more contingency-driven strategic stance adopted by these SBUs. We conclude with a discussion of the theoretical and managerial benefits of an improved methodology for empirically deriving strategic typologies.

TI Israel and the origins of Iran's Arab option: Dissection of a strategy
   misunderstood
SO MIDDLE EAST JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB This article argues that Iran's "Arab option" - the Arab and pro-Palestinian tilt in Iran's foreign policy - did not emerge out of the ideological musings of Iran's Islamic revolutionaries, but out of Iran's new-found position of preeminence in the later years of the Shah's rule. The sustainability of Iran's regional leadership required Arab acceptance and support, which could only be won through a pro-Arab orientation in Iran's foreign policy.

TI The economic policies of Turkey's AKP government: Rabbits from a hat?
SO MIDDLE EAST JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB How can we account for the priority that Turkey's "Islam-sensitive" government has placed on adhering to the IMF's prescriptions for macroeconomic stability and fiscal restraint in lieu of its electoral promises to pursue a justice-oriented social agenda and aggressively tackle problems of poverty and unemployment? In this article this question is answered by analyzing the challenges posed by international factors (debt sustainability, pressures by the IMF and the EU), as well as domestic factors (the Justice and Development Party's (AKP) own unpreparedness, oppositional tactics by the secularist establishment) that have shaped the AKP government's economic policies.

TI The rise and fall of the Ebro water transfer
SO NATURAL RESOURCES JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB This article analyzes the Ebro inter-basin transfer, which was the main project of the Spanish National Hydrological Plan. The Ebro transfer was prompted by pervasive pressures, scarcity, and degradation of southeastern basins in Spain. The heated policy debate on the Ebro transfer highlights the difficulties of achieving a sustainable management of water resources because of the conflicting interests of stakeholders and regions. Alternatives to the Ebro transfer show that acceptable outcomes combine demand and supply measures. Nevertheless, implementation could be difficult, requiring compensation to farmers; otherwise, an excessive burden on farmers would be met by social opposition, leading to the failure of the measures.

   experiment

ID PLANT-COMMUNITIES; PRODUCTIVITY; DIVERSITY; DROUGHT
AB Human-driven ecosystem simplification has highlighted questions about how the number of species in an ecosystem influences its functioning. Although biodiversity is now known to affect ecosystem productivity(1-6), its effects on stability are debated(6-13). Here we present a long-term experimental field test of the diversity - stability hypothesis. During a decade of data collection in an experiment that directly controlled the number of perennial prairie species(4), growing-season climate varied considerably, causing year-to-year variation in abundances of plant species and in ecosystem productivity. We found that greater numbers of plant species led to greater temporal stability of ecosystem annual aboveground plant production. In particular, the decadal temporal stability of the ecosystem, whether measured with intervals of two, five or ten years, was significantly greater at higher plant diversity and tended to increase as plots matured. Ecosystem stability was also positively dependent on root mass, which is a measure of perenniating biomass. Temporal stability of the ecosystem increased with diversity, despite a lower temporal stability of individual species, because of both portfolio ( statistical averaging) and overyielding effects. However, we found no evidence of a covariance effect. Our results indicate that the reliable, efficient and sustainable supply of some foods ( for example, livestock fodder), biofuels and ecosystem services can be enhanced by the use of biodiversity.

AB The diversity of a degraded grassland community on the Chinese Inner Mongolia steppe dominated by Artemisia frigida (Asteraceae) subject to a range of grazing treatments (zero, and light, medium and heavy grazing) for 13 years was studied from July to August 2002. Under zero grazing, percentage total vegetation cover was significantly (P < 0.05) less than under light, medium, and heavy grazing. Although not dominant in any treatments, percentage cover of Carex duriuscula (Cyperaceae) was higher than other species in the zero, light, and medium grazed treatments. Its cover tended to decline as grazing intensity increased (P = 0.49). Aneurolepidium chinense (Poaceae) reasserted its dominant status in the zero grazed grassland; A. frigida remained dominant under light and medium grazing. Under heavy grazing, Potentilla acaulis (Rosaceae) was the dominant species and it provided the highest percentage cover. Zero and heavy grazing resulted in fewer (three-four) species contributing most of the total cover (cf. six seven species for light and medium grazing). This was reflected by indices of diversity and evenness, which were highest for light and medium grazing. The Simpson Dominance Index was highest for the zero and heavily grazed treatments, indicating that at the extremes of the grazing spectrum, single species tended to exclude potential co-dominants more effectively than at intermediate levels of grazing. Selective grazing was a key process. Grazing increased the proportion of unpalatable and grazing resistant species, and species that although palatable, were relatively inconspicuous. These findings are discussed in terms of their impact on the productivity and long sustainability of grazing. The need to develop a better understanding of underlying processes, and more sustainable forms of grazing management are highlighted.

AB A database was constructed comprising records from 2255 pasture phosphorus (P), potassium (K) and sulphur (S) field trials, of which 1799 included one or several rates of P. Subsets of this data were selected based on predetermined criteria to define the relationships between relative pasture production and available soil P (0-75 mm, Olsen P in mu g P cm(-3) soil)-the P production functions-for the major soil groups in New Zealand. These relationships, and their 95% confidence intervals, were defined using Bayesian statistics. For those soil groups for which there was sufficient data, the production functions were well defined and gave reasonably precise estimates of the relative pasture yield for a given Olsen P. For example, for the volcanic soils, the relative pasture production is most likely (P < 0.05) to be in the range 88-94% at Olsen P 25 and 98-100% at Olsen P 50. The shape of the production functions was similar for all soil groups-the relative pasture production increased with increasing Olsen P up to an asymptote-except the pumice soils and the podzols, which showed irregularities. The production function for the podzols was also flatter. There was good agreement between the empirically derived production functions and those generated from a dynamic P model. The Olsen P level required to achieve 97% maximum production was estimated for all soil groups. These ranged from 10 to 45 depending on soil group. The critical Olsen P levels were related to the soil anion storage capacity (ASC, a laboratory measure of P buffer capacity) and to soil volume weight (g cm(-3) of sieved and dried soil), although not strongly. The field measured P buffer capacity (Delta P-F)-the amount of soluble fertiliser P (kg P ha(-1)) required above maintenance to increase the Olsen P (0-75 mm) level by I unit-was estimated for selected trials. There was reasonable agreement between these estimates and those derived from the P model (Delta P-M), and these results indicated that Delta P decreases with increasing Olsen P. The results imply that factors other than those related to soil chemical properties affect the relationship between soil P and pasture production. The factors which determine the relationship between pasture production and soil P are defined and discussed. These were assigned to two categories: those factors which affect the ability of the soil to supply P for plant uptake and those that affect the ability of the plant to acquire soil P. It is concluded that further progress towards improving our ability to predict pasture responses to fertiliser P will depend on quantifying the latter effects. Based on these results and the development of a dynamic P model, an econometric P model was developed for New Zealand pastures which enables consultants to quantify the likely agronomic, financial and investment effects of any given fertiliser strategy on a given farm or block within a farm. This was not previously possible but is essential for the sustainable use of P fertilisers in pastoral farming.

AB Aerial surveys of Hector's dolphins were carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of the Banks Peninsula Marine Mammal Sanctuary. In summer, the proportion of sightings inside the 4 nautical mile offshore boundary of the sanctuary was 79%. This dropped to just over 35% in winter. These estimates were used in a population viability analysis to determine whether the sanctuary needs to be extended to reduce dolphin bycatch to sustainable levels. We followed the standard procedure for setting limits on marine mammal bycatch in the United States to calculate a bycatch limit of 1.6 or 2.8 dolphins per year (depending on whether the sanctuary population is included). If the offshore boundary was extended to 15 nautical miles, the sanctuary would need to be extended alongshore north and south by more than 30 nautical miles to reduce bycatch to 2.8, or north and south by 60 nautical miles to reduce bycatch to 1.6 dolphins per year.

TI Framing 'Till Eulenspiegel' (Strauss's 'Till Eulenspiegels Lustige

SO NINETEENTH CENTURY MUSIC

CY FEB 03, 2000

DE German early modernism; Till Eulenspiegel; Nietzsche; sonata
   deformation; antimetaphysical aesthetics
AB Strauss's Till Eulenspiegels lustige Streiche (1895) may be read as the composer's credo of a new, antimetaphysical musical modernism that resonated with aspects of Nietzschean philosophy. In the immediately preceding years Strauss had taken a decisive philosophical-aesthetic turn away from the metaphysical assertions of Schopenhauer and Wagner and toward a more individualistic, palpably material conception of music. As was recognized by some writers of that period, the provocations and unstoppable laughter apparent in the tone poem could be understood as brash dismissals of one "sacred" tenet of the institution of art music after another. The seemingly gemutlich wit represented by Till (a metaphorical stand-in for Strauss himself) masked a more subversive agenda: on the one hand, a mocking of the metaphysical pretensions that then underpinned the art-music enterprise; on the other, the proclaiming of a new aesthetic staging itself as exhilaratingly emancipated from the overly inflated "Spirit of Gravity" still dominating that cultural sector of the musical world. These subversions are perceptible not only in the piece's program but also in its local musical details and overall formal construction.
   Several larger issues are at stake in such considerations. Strauss's personal move away from the metaphysics of music provides one of the earliest, most urgent alarms from within the high-prestige cultural system that its fundamental axioms were now corroding away, no longer sustainable by authoritarian fiat, in a rapidly modernizing and secularizing world.
   In turn, this suggests that such a reframing of Strauss's (and others') projects could encourage historians to approach the separate subhistories of musical modernism with a more problematized complexity and nuance. Finally-as all commentators on Till Eulenspiegel have noted-a significant part of the piece's impact resides its flamboyant, high-technical compositional display (a leading sign of its "modernism"). From this perspective the requisite framing is grounded in our recognition of its brazenly confrontational dialogue with established musical styles and practices. Non-normative formal patterning and architectonic layout are substantial components of Strauss's (Till's) musical subversion. In the reading proposed here, Till Eulenspiegel is processed as a radicalized sonata-rondo deformation with telling hermeneutic and social connotations, some of whose essential clues are located in the piece's prologue and epilogue. I interweave this analytical interpretation with remarks about the concept of sonata (and sonata-rondo) deformations as applied to music of the late nineteenth century.

TI Seven fallacies in architectural culture
SO OPEN HOUSE INTERNATIONAL

DT Article
DE culture; typology; innovation; media; place
AB !As on architect and educator I worry about the intellectual and pragmatic challenges that currently bedevil architectural practice and pedagogy. There ore at least seven design fallacies that in various combinations permeate professional practice and studio culture at most schools of architecture. Some ore self-imposed and tractable; others ore less easily addressed because they ore externally driven by the medic, technology, globalization and capital. Some ore about form-making; others ore about social equity and environmental sustainability. All seven are deeply embedded in our architectural psyches. Changing them will not be easy, but change them we must if we wont to recuperate architecture and urbanism, as well as invigorate them as a more positive and progressive force in the world.

AB The author examines various cases of conservation policies in practice, and the implication of those practices in terms of the ecologies they support, showing, in the end, that the "nature" being preserved is not always the one intended. In doing this, insights are also gleaned to inform how we should do environmental sociology, and what lies in environmental sociology's future if we work toward this end. The author argues that environmental sociology needs to become more environmental: to be willing to understand sociobiophysical relationships in all their complexity, even in those cases that require a well-grounded understanding of ecosystem processes. Thus, although retaining focus on the historical subject, which shapes conceptions of and ultimately practices toward ecology, we must also begin to view this subject as also an ecological object. The implications of such an analytic move, in terms of what it means for environmental sociology's future, are then discussed.

AB Total factor productivity (TFP) is a central concept in the mainstream analysis of economic growth. Using aggregate production functions, economists estimate the shares of economic growth explained by increases in capital, labor, and (in some applications) natural resource inputs. The residual of unexplained growth is then ascribed to "disembodied" technological advance or TFP This article develops a radical ecological-economic critique of TFP analysis. The critique uses Marxist theory to synthesize relevant nonmainstream perspectives including ecological economics (especially Georgescu-Roegen's critique of the aggregate production function and Daly's rejection of the mainstream "circular flow" vision of the economy), neo-Schumpetarian criticisms of disembodied technological change, and the "identification" critique which shows that TFP estimates merely capture the accounting identity between income and value added. From a Marxist perspective, TFP theory's false dematerialization of production technology reflects capitalism's alienation of workers and communities from necessary conditions of production.

AB International labor environmentalism, a significant innovation in global politics, centers on the role of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions at the United Nations' Commission on Sustainable Development and other bodies. Unions face multiple challenges in international institutions, for example, from partnerships that privatize government functions and from disagreements within unions. Nonetheless, this article finds that environmentalism arising from the character of trade unions and the ideology of leaders has great potential.

TI Reducing asymmetries in intergenerational justice - Descent from
   modernity or space industrialization?
SO ORGANIZATION & ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE intergenerational justice; sustainable development; deep ecology; space
   industrialization
AB Normally, contractual conceptions of intergenerational justice regard the responsibility held by each generation as symmetrical. This article argues that the late modern society has created an asymmetry because of its unprecendented instrumental and destructive capacity. Historically unique risks such as thermonuclear destruction, global ecological deprivation, and resource depletion all point at this asymmetry and unequal distribution of responsibility between generations. Extending one contractual device used by John Rawls in line with what Brian Barry has suggested, this article analyzes the roots of the asymmetry and presents two political strategies to end it. The first strategy resembles the traditional deep ecological programme whereas the second holds an imaginative vision of a human future in space. Both strategies seek to reduce the influence present generations exercise on the level of opportunity available to future generations. The key normative argument is that intergenerational justice requires spatial and temporal limits on political action.

AB The centuries-old, self-organizing Muang Fai community irrigation institution in northern Thailand has high potential in illustrating exemplary practices in irrigation cost sharing. This paper examines the cost sharing structure of the Pongsak Muang Fai Irrigation System in Mae Hong Son Province and its relationship with the system water management and sustainability. Results show that this primitive and high cost system accepts costs of the weir, the entire length of main ditch, not only the individually related ditch sections, and the management as common costs that should be equally shared so that it can gather sizeable membership to support the system. The capacity of this small scale run-of-the-river irrigation system with no river flow limitation is a simple summation of all determined farm intake capacities. The maintenance cost of the system every year depends on how much water should be diverted and conveyed, hence the use of "relative" scale of each farm intake capacity as the basis for sharing cost in the wet season paddy farming. Such structure is directly related to the water management under which every intake shall be served with continuous supply without permitting mid-canal water check-up and the members prefer to take collective action to keep enough water supply without leaving any room for suspicion of unfair water distribution. The direct relationship makes the members understand the purpose of payment and be willing to share the costs which are transparently estimated in easily understood terms and clearly de-aggregated into categories.

AB We have identified and partially sequenced 8 ABC transporters from an EST dataset of Sarcoptes scabiei var. hominis, the causative agent of scabies. Analysis confirmed that most of the known ABC subfamilies are represented in the EST dataset including several members of the multidrug resistance protein subfamily (ABC-C). Although P-glycoprotein (ABC-B) sequences were not found in the EST dataset, a partial P-glycoprotein sequence was subsequently obtained using a degenerate PCR strategy and library screening. Thus a total of 9 potential S. scabiei ABC transporters representing the subfamilies A, B, C, E, F and H have been identified. lvermectin is currently used in the treatment of hyper-infested (crusted) scabies, and has also been identified as a potentially effective acaricide for mass treatment programmes in scabies-endemic communities. The observation of clinical and in vitro ivermectin resistance in 2 crusted scabies patients who received multiple treatments has raised serious concerns regarding the sustainability of such programmes. One possible mechanism for ivermectin resistance is through ABC transporters such as P-glycoprotein. This work forms an important foundation for further studies to elucidate the potential role of ABC transporters in ivermectin resistance of S. scabiei.

AB OBJECTIVE. Chronic lead poisoning and iron deficiency are concentrated in urban children from lower socioeconomic strata, and both impair neurocognitive development. Our study objective was to determine if iron fortification reduces blood lead levels in urban, lead-exposed, iron-deficient children in Bangalore, India.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS. A randomized, double-blind, controlled school-based feeding trial was done in 5- to 13-year-old iron-deficient children (n = 186). At baseline, a high prevalence of lead poisoning was found in the younger children. Subsequently, all 5- to 9-year-old children participating in the trial ( n = 134) were followed to determine if iron fortification would affect their blood lead levels.
   INTERVENTION. Children were dewormed and fed 6 days/week for 16 weeks either an iron-fortified rice meal (similar to 15 mg of iron per day as ferric pyrophosphate) or an identical control meal without added iron. Feeding was directly supervised and compliance monitored.
   OUTCOME MEASURES. Hemoglobin, serum ferritin, C-reactive protein, transferrin receptor, zinc protoporphyrin, and blood lead concentrations were measured. RESULTS. The prevalence of iron deficiency was significantly reduced in the iron group (from 70% to 28%) compared with the control group (76% to 55%). There was a significant decrease in median blood lead concentration in the iron group compared with the control group. The prevalence of blood lead levels >= 10 mu g/dL was significantly reduced in the iron group (from 65% to 29%) compared with the control group (68% to 55%).
   CONCLUSIONS. Our findings suggest providing iron in a fortified food to lead-exposed children may reduce chronic lead intoxication. Iron fortification may be an effective and sustainable strategy to accompany environmental lead abatement.

ID COVER
AB Landscape changes were traced over the 20 years from 1974 to 1995 in the upper Minjiang River basin, one of the most important forest regions in China, based on satellite image interpretation to provide basic data for local decision-making as well as sustainable landscape use and management. Results revealed that landscape from 1974 to 1995 changed at the regional scale as the area of forestland decreased, while cropland, shrubland, economic forest, grassland, and built-up land increased. Landscape changes mainly occurred in forestland, shrubland, grassland, economic forest, and built-up land. Moreover, the changes among forestland, shrubland, and grassland were the largest, influencing the whole characteristics of the changes in, the basin. Analysis of the changes between 1974 and 1995 in the study area indicated that landscape heterogeneity and fragmentation increased, whereas landscape connectivity decreased. There were multiple reasons for landscape changes. A principal component analysis (PCA) was used to quantitatively study driving forces of landscape changes. The PGA results showed that economic and population factors were the principal driving forces of landscape changes from 1974 to 1995 in the upper Minjiang River basin, and that PCA was a suitable method for investigating driving forces of landscape changes.

TI Planning for secondary expansion in sub-Saharan Africa - pathways
   towards sustainable financing
SO PERSPECTIVES IN EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Investment in secondary schooling in sub-Saharan Africa has been neglected over the last two decades. Emphasis on universalising primary schooling has shaped national policy and flows of international assistance to favour rapid expansion at the first level of schooling. Though there are many good reasons for this emphasis, this has resulted in very slow growth in participation above primary level in low enrolment countries with adverse consequences both for maintaining enrolment gains at primary level and for long-term economic growth. This article makes out a case for a new balance in resource allocation that could address development needs more comprehensively. It identifies critical issues for planners that include structural changes, more equitable access, and pathways towards more sustainable financing.

AB An experiment was conducted from 1997 to 2000 on an acid soil in Cameroon to assess the effectiveness of cultivating acid tolerant maize (Zea mays L.) cultivar and the use of organic and inorganic fertilizers as options for the management of soil acidity. The factors investigated were: phosphorus (0 and 60 kg ha(-1)), dolomitic lime (0 and 2 t ha(-1)), organic manure (no manure, 4 t ha(-1) poultry manure, and 4 t ha(-1) of leaves of Senna spectabilis), and maize cultivars (ATP-SR-Y - an acid soil-tolerant, and Tuxpe (n) over tildeo sequia - an acid susceptible). On acid soil, maize grain yield of ATP-SR-Y was 61% higher than the grain yield of Tuxpe (n) over tildeo sequia. Continuous maize cultivation on acid soil further increased soil acidity, which was manifested by a decrease in pH (0.23 unit), exchangeable Ca (31%) and Mg (36%) and by an increase in exchangeable Al (20%). Yearly application of 60 kg ha(-1) of P for 3 years increased soil acidity through increases in exchangeable Al (8%) and H (16%) and a decrease in exchangeable Ca (30%), Mg (11%) and pH (0.07 unit). Lime application increased grain yield of the tolerant (82%) and susceptible (208%) cultivars. The grain yield increases were associated with a mean decrease of 43% in exchangeable Al, and 51% in H, a mean increase of 0.27 unit in pH, 5% in CEC, 154% in exchangeable Ca, and 481% in Mg contents of the soil. Poultry manure was more efficient than leaves of Senna producing 38% higher grain yield. This yield was associated with increases in pH, Ca, Mg and P, and a decrease in Al. The highest mean grain yields were obtained with lime added to poultry manure (4.70 t ha(-1)) or leaves of Senna (4.72 t ha(-1)). Grain yield increase was more related to the decrease in exchangeable Al (r = -0.86 to -0.95, P < 0.01) and increase in Ca (r = 0.78-0.94, P < 0.01), than to pH (r = -0.57 (non-significant) to -0.58 (P < 0.05)). Exchangeable Al was the main factor determining pH (r = -0.88 to -0.92, P < 0.01). The yield advantage of the acid tolerant cultivar was evident even after correcting for soil acidity. Acid soil-tolerant cultivars are capable of bringing unproductive acid soils into cultivation on the short run. The integration of soil amendments together with acid soil-tolerant cultivar offers a sustainable and comprehensive strategy for the management of acid soils in the tropics.

ID FALLOW PERIOD; SOIL; SYSTEMS; WEEDS; MANAGEMENT; DYNAMICS; FIELDS
AB In northern Laos, upland rice is grown as a subsistence crop under rainfed conditions with no fertilizer inputs. It has traditionally been grown under slash-and-burn systems with long fallows, which restore soil fertility and reduce insect and weed pressure. However, increasing population density and government policies aimed at reducing the area under slash-and-burn have reduced fallows to as little as two or three years between rice crops. In this paper the impact of intensifying upland rice cultivation and rainfall on upland rice productivity was evaluated using yield and rainfall data from Luang Prabang province from 1992 to 2004. In addition, an experiment was conducted in 2004 to evaluate the effect of upland rice cropping intensification on soil nitrogen (N) and phosphate (P) availability and root pests (Tetraneura nigriabdominalis-root aphids and Meloidogyne graminicola Golden & Birchfield-nematodes). Rice yields were associated with total rainfall from June through August, corresponding to mid-tillering through flowering growth stages of upland rice. Increased cropping intensity resulted in a significant reduction of upland rice yields with higher rice yields being associated with longer fallows. Furthermore, when rice was annually cropped in the same field without fallows, rice yields rapidly declined. A study conducted in 2004 indicated that increasing cropping intensity reduced the soil N and P availability and increased root aphid infection of rice. The long-term productivity of upland rice can not be sustained with increased cropping intensity using the current management practices. Therefore, improved crop and resource management technologies are necessary for sustainable production.

AB This study evaluated institutional sustainability of the Early Risers "Skills for Success" conduct problems prevention program. In a previous early-stage effectiveness trial Early Risers had been successfully implemented by a nonprofit community agency with guidance, supervision, technical assistance and fiscal support/oversight provided by program developers. The current advanced-stage effectiveness trial applied a randomized, control group design to determine whether this community agency could replicate earlier positive findings with a new cohort of participants, but with less direct involvement of program developers. An intent-to-intervene strategy was used to compare children randomly assigned to Early Risers or a no-intervention comparison group. Compared to results obtained in an early-stage effectiveness trial, program attendance rates were much lower and only one positive outcome was replicated. Failure to replicate program effects was not attributed to poor program implementation, because data collected pertaining to exposure, adherence and quality of delivery were acceptable, and a participation analysis showed that families who attended at higher levels did benefit. It was difficulties that the community agency experienced in engaging families in program components at recommended levels that primarily accounted for the results. Possible organizational barriers that impeded sustainability included unreliable transportation, poor collaboration between the agency and the local public school system, high staff turnover, agency downsizing, and fiduciary responsibility and accountability. It was concluded that both program developers and program providers need to be proactive in planning for sustainability.

AB Ala-screening mutagenesis studies on Arg1, Pro2, Arg3, Phe4 and Thr54 of Naja naja atra (Taiwan cobra) chymotrypsin inhibitor showed that inhibitory potency and gross conformation of the mutants were not significantly different from those of wild-type inhibitor. Nevertheless, the R1A mutant had an appreciable decrease in the structural stability underlying thermal unfolding and urea-induced denaturation. Alternatively, deleting the first three residues at the N-terminus caused a reduction in structural stability as well as inhibitory potency. In sharp contrast to wild-type and other mutated inhibitors, R1A mutant and truncated mutant completely lost their inhibitory activity when the inhibitors were incubated with chymotrypsin for periods of up to 3 h. The loss of activity correlated with chymotryptic cleavage of inhibitors as evidenced by SDA-PAGE. Taken together, these results reflect that the globally structural rigidity of N. naja atra chymotrypsin inhibitor functionally affects the sustainable period in inhibiting chymotrypsin activity, and that the intact N-terminus might contribute to this event.

TI Toward sustainable consumption: Researching voluntary simplifiers
SO PSYCHOLOGY & MARKETING
LA English
DT Article
ID SELECT PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONS; SIMPLICITY LIFE-STYLES; SOCIETAL
   CONSEQUENCES; CONSUMER; BEHAVIOR
AB This article examines and extends the notion of voluntary simplifiers (VS). VS are individuals who have freely chosen a frugal, anticonsumer lifestyle that features low resource use and environmental impact. The article will begin by reviewing empirical work with VS and their mainstream counterparts, non-voluntary simplifiers (NVS). It will go on to identify and locate within this literature an intermediate group: beginner voluntary simplifiers (BVS). BVS may support some aspects of sustainability (such as buying fair-trade coffee or recycling domestic waste) without either embracing a complete lifestyle change like VS, or completely dismissing ethical or environmental features of products and services they consume, like NVS. Insight into the complex decision-making processes of BVS is crucial for the understanding of the concept of voluntary simplification and is therefore important for the advancement of sustainable consumption.

AB Biomass can provide a sustainable and renewable source of transportation fuels and industrial chemicals that may significantly reduce our dependence upon petroleum. The agricultural sector has made significant progress in developing these bio-based fuels and chemicals. Technologies from the agricultural sector may be combined with recent technical improvements that have made wood-based bioconversion more feasible. The bioconversion platform has the ability to serve as the basis for full-fledged wood-based biorefining operations, generating value-added bioproducts as well as fuel and energy for the forest sector.

AB Companies have historically invested in large research and development departments to drive innovation and provide sustainable growth. This model, however, is eroding due to a number of factors. What is emerging is a more open model, where companies recognize that not all good ideas will come from inside the organization and not all good ideas created within the organization can be successfully marketed internally. To date, Open Innovation concepts have been regarded as relevant primarily to 'high-technology' industries, with examples that include Lucent, 3Com, IBM, Intel and Millenium Pharmaceuticals. In this article, we identify organizations in industries outside 'high technology' that are early adopters of the concept. Our findings demonstrate that many Open Innovation concepts are already in use in a wide range of industries. We document practices that appear to assist organizations adopting these concepts, and discover that Open Innovation is not ipso facto a recipe for outsourcing R&D. We conclude that Open Innovation has utility as a paradigm for industrial innovation beyond high tech to more traditional and mature industries.

AB A debate is currently ongoing in the UK regarding the need to collect and report data at the regional level. One specific area of this debate is the extent to which region-specific economic and environmental data are required to carry out analyses of devolved sustainability policy issues. This paper uses the Jersey economy as a case study to assess the added precision from using good-quality region-specific data compared with adjusted national UK data. It is found that, due to differences in polluting technology between Jersey and the UK, estimates based on national emissions intensities produce results that are misleading in terms of both absolute pollution levels and the relative contribution of different activities to total emissions in the economy. While Jersey may be regarded as atypical in many ways relative to other UK regions, it is argued that, the results show that regional environmental accounts must reflect differences in polluting technology in different locations. Moreover, accounting for differences in polluting technology is even more crucial in light of current policy interest in tracing the actual resource use and pollution generation in any one region's or country's imports to measure the global impact, or ecological footprint, of economic activity.

AB Cotton production is the number one crop enterprise in Georgia in terms of revenue generation. However, due to continuous deterioration of soil quality with conventional tillage and chemical fertilizer application, the economic viability and sustainability of cotton production in Georgia are questionable. Residue management systems (RMSs) comprising winter cover crops were analyzed as an alternative to the existing system, which consists of conventional tillage and chemical fertilizer using yield benefit, net revenue, carbon sequestration, and yield efficiency criteria. Four different RMSs were examined for profitability and input efficiency. Four RMSs encompassing tillage versus no-till and chemical versus organic sources of plant nutrients were compared for their yield and net return differences. No-till and poultry litter with a cover crop was the only system with a positive return and crop yield based on the results from experimental data. Limited results from the experimental field were reinforced using a simulation study. When cotton yield is simulated with an alternative level of organic matter and nitrogen application, production function shows efficiency in input application at the higher level of organic matter. Regression results based on an erosion productivity impact calculator/environmental policy integrated climate (EPIC) simulation indicated that, in the long term, a no-till and poultry litter system may have promise in the region. The results from simulation confirm the results from the experimental study. This study reflected a need to change the cotton management system from the 200-year-old practice of employing intensively cultivated conventional tillage and chemical fertilizers to a new renewable resource-based system where residue management and organic sources of nutrients would be the key components.

AB Theory predicts that the voluntary or community sector will contribute a range of services that are not delivered by the state or private sectors. This paper examines the changing contributions of the community waste sector in the UK to reflect upon these claims. A rosy picture of the community waste sector is presented from research on the sector in 2002, with a growing number of organisations carrying out a range of services, drawing on multiple and diverse sources of funding. More recent evidence, and information drawn from outside the sector, however, suggests that regulation, competition, and changes to funding regimes are putting the sector under considerable pressure, such that it is likely to change, and that some parts of it will contract. In terms of the claims from theory, the paper finds evidence that the community sector can and has been innovative in the services it provides and the way that it provides them, though similar innovations may emerge from the private and public sectors. The sparse evidence on participation and recycling rates in kerbside and civic amenity sites are equivocal on whether the sector provides enhanced communication as theory would predict. Overall, the paper highlights the difficulty in achieving direct comparisons between the waste sectors without specific focused research for this purpose. It concludes that the challenge for European, national and local government is to influence the necessarily constructed waste markets in a way which will enhance rather than discourage service providers to innovate in the waste material collected, and to communicate effectively with the public whom they serve. Such policies promise to encourage the effective delivery of sustainable waste services from all three - public, private and community - sectors. (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB We develop a simple mechanism to explain why resource windfalls are likely to lower income levels in the long run. Most mineral-producing countries, in particular, fail to maintain incentives for savings and investment after positive resource shocks. Our analysis focuses on this savings-investment transmission channel through which resource rents affect welfare, and develops an Overlapping-Generations (OLG) model with features from endogenous growth theory to study the mechanism. In this model, savings adjust downwards to income from natural resources, investments adjust to savings, and subsequently the level of overall productivity falls. Resource affluence has two counteracting effects on income. In the short term, resource wealth augments income, but in the long-term, it decreases income through a crowding-out effect on knowledge creation. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The penetration of sustainable technologies in electricity generation is low until now in Greece. However, the recent adoption of legislative rules towards the effective operation of liberalized markets, as well as the increased impact of climate change on the electricity sector towards the period 2008-2012, bring out these technologies as key means for establishing conditions of security, stability and environmental protection. The objective of this paper is to put on the map the sustainable technologies for electricity generation in Greece through the formulation of a collective interactive supportive framework, using an existing multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method to elaborate more realistic and transparent outcomes. The approach was implemented under the umbrella of the national Foresight Programme, to assist policy making for sustainable electricity generation technologies. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB At the beginning of the 21 st century, the Alps are in an unprecedented situation where the capability of intercultural cooperation may have a strong influence on the future. European integration, improved accessibility of the valleys, the impact of new communication technologies, the rapidly increasint importance of global markets and a decreasing symbolic importance of the Alps all together lead to a 1( shrinking) of this exceptional mountain range situated in the middle of important European cities, urge to consider a larger context and open up a variety of new perspectives. Will it be possible to re-invent a specifically Alpine development model despite all infernal differences, actively relating to the rich multicultural environment and taking care of the delicate natural and cultural heritage? Or will the Alps fall apart in separate backyards of the large cities? The article analyses the role of the Alpine Convention and explores the cooperation interests of different actors. It proposes to conceive the Alps as a laboratory for European cooperation and calls for a systematic joining of forces between regional, national and European decision-making levels in the spirit of subsidiarity.

AB Forest ecosystems provide a variety of services and forest ecosystem management (FEM) is an effective approach to maximize the services. Because of the complexity of forest ecosystems, the applications of FEM can be facilitated with decision support systems (DSS) that recognize and incorporate ecological and socio-economic variables. With the rapid development of computation and information technologies, DSS have been advanced in many ways. Traditional forest management within a forestry unit in China is planned on a yearly basis. The planning itself remains primarily a verbal concept as there are no quantitative decision-support tools available to translate the concept into forest management actions. For the purposes of FEM at the management level, a forest management DFF, FORESTAR((R)), has been developed under a framework of geographic information system (GIS) and forest models. The paper explained the intelligent modeling mechanisms and demonstrated how the applications of FEM can be strengthened with the applications of FORESTAR((R)).

AB Six forestry scientific and technological projects being actualized in China were the implementations of ecological construction and security, development of forestry biological technique and fine variety cultivation, protection and utilization of forest biological germplasm resources, development of forestry bio-industry and digital forestry, and construction of forestry innovation ability. Among them, digital forestry was an effective measure to improve the ability of forestry innovation, to realize resources sharing, and to develop sustainable forestry. Spatial database of digital forestry should be constructed according to the criteria and index system of forest sustainable management. Based on analyzing the status and advances of China's digital forestry construction, a database framework of digital forestry towards sustainable forestry development was studied and established preparatorily. The database was divided into four layers as theory layer, system layer, status layer, and parameter layer. It was concluded that during the process of digital forestry platform construction, the relative social, economic, and politic data should be considered and collected, which meant that the database should represent not only the current forestry development, but also the social, politic, and economic situations. Constructing China's digital forestry information platform under full utilization of idea and index system for sustainable forest management was urgent and important.

ID CHINA; AREA
AB Based on the spatial information techniques such as RS, GIS, and GPS, the forest landscape patterns in the Helan Mountain, western China, were studied. The Landsat 5 TM data were used to classify the forest landscapes through RS digital cartography, and then, the landscape characteristics and landscape pattern were analyzed quantificationally. Furthermore, through spatial data collection and spatial analysis of the main disturbances in this area, the cause of landscape formation was studied. The results showed that the total 1177 forest landscape patches could be classified into 21 landscape types, and the forest landscape in the Helan Mountain was island pattern, which was encircled by deserta as matrix. The values of landscape diversity index and landscape fragmentation index were 2.61 and 0.43, respectively. In this area, the landscape pattern was clearly formed and continuously changed in response to geological processes, climate, activities of organisms, forest fire, desertification, human activities and so on. This landscape pattern had an obviously negative effect on the stability and ecosystem services of forests. So, scientific landscape planning and protection should be adopted to improve the sustainability of forest management in this area.

AB Based on temporal data collected from 36 re-measured plots, transition probabilities of trees from a diameter class to a higher class were analyzed for the broad-leaved-Korean pine forest in the Changbai Mountains. It was found that the transition probabilities were related not only to diameter size but also to the total basal area of trees with the diameter class. This paper demonstrates the development of a density-dependent matrix model, DM2, and a series of simulations with it for forest stands with different conditions under different harvest schemes. After validations with independent field data, this model proved a suitable tool for optimization analysis of harvest schemes on computers. The optimum harvest scheme(s) can be determined by referring to stand growth, total timbers harvested, and size diversity changes over time. Three user-friendly interfaces were built with a forest management decision support system FORESTAR((R)) for easy operations of DM2 by forest managers. This paper also summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of DM2.

AB Management-level forest resource data in China were obtained with a combination of two forest inventories. However, inconsistencies in the spatial attributes of forest data vary between the two inventory types and between two inventories of the same type. The inconsistencies make it inconvenient for long-term forest management planning with digital technologies.
   Ecological Land Types (ELTs) and Ecological Land Type Phases (ELTPs) have been mapped in selected forestry regions in northeast China, where important forest industries are located. The boundaries of ELTs are determined by geomorphic conditions, which are quantified by Digital Elevation Models (DEM); ELTPs are classified by overlaying ELTs with forest vegetation data layers that are obtained with both remotely sensed and ground data. The ELTPs represent the divisions of land in terms of both natural and human-induced forest conditions, and therefore they are reliable units for forest inventories and management.
   This paper introduces a case study for digitally determining forest inventory units in Benxi City, Liaoning Province, northeast China. The general objective of the study was to explain how a compatible forest inventory system should be designed and why the compatible forest inventory system was significant to digital forestry in China.

AB Forests in the Changbai Mountains are important timber sources for economic development of the society and provide ecological services in northeast China. In order to strengthen forest resource management, this paper analyzed management-induced changes in forest structure, tree species composition and forest landscape pattern from 1987 to 2000 for Baihe Forestry Bureau in Jilin Province based on digitized forest parcel maps and forest survey data. The results suggested that the area of Mature, High-Stocking, and Close-Canopy Forests decreased by 31.4%, 55.9% and 10.7% respectively; volume of Mixed Forest, the native forest vegetation type, decreased by 17.8%; the number of patches increased tremendously but the mean patch density decreased sharply for Mature, High-Stocking, Close-Canopy, and Mixed Forests. All the changes in forest structure, species composition, and landscape pattern indicated severe degradations going on with the forests in Baihe Forestry Bureau. Because of the effect of degradation to forest services, restoring forest resources and protecting biodiversity has become urgently important. The strategies of sustainable forest management need to be worked out and implemented.

AB The water quality of a river at any point reflects several major influences including but are not limited to climatic conditions and anthropogenic inputs. Assessing these influences is essential for managing land and water resources within a particular river catchment. The objectives of this study were to identify the causes of increasing or decreasing trends in the concentrations of various water quality parameters in the Abou Ali River in North Lebanon and to account for the consequential variations both annual and seasonal (low/high flow). The assessment was conducted at the end of the dry season in October 2002 and 2003 and the end of the wet season in March 2003 and 2004. Results established that dissolved oxygen levels were consistently higher at the end of the wet season. The concentrations of biochemical oxygen demand, ammonia nitrogen and ortho-phosphates did not exhibit a clear seasonal or annual variation. While the levels of total dissolved solids and nitrate nitrogen exhibited a decreasing trend in urban catchments, an increasing trend was observed in rural, agricultural and forested areas. The findings of this study reinforce the notion that management of point and non-point sources should be integrated as the combination of both sources connected with land use results in deleterious effects on water quality. The lack of good quality water hinders economic development and the potential for long term sustainability. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Striped weakfish (Cynoscion guatucupa) and whitemouth croaker (Micropogonias furnieri) are important commercial and recreational species found in abundance along the South American Atlantic coast. In recent years otolith chemical composition has been used as a tool for identifying fish stocks for several species. The chemical composition of C. guatucupa and M. furnieri otoliths was determined by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) in samples from coastal sites (Partido de La Costa, Mar del Plata and San Blas Bay). Significant differences in the ratios of Mg/Ca, Mn/Ca and Sr/Ca for C. guatucupa otoliths and Cd/Ca, Cu/Ca, Mg/Ca, Sr/Ca and Zn/Ca for M. furnieri otoliths suggest the existence of two different fish stocks, one originating in the north (including Samborombon Bay and Partido de La Costa fisheries) and another originating in the south (including "El Rincon" and San BIAS fisheries). These results agree with previous studies on the same species using different methodologies. These stocks may be separated by an oceanographic barrier, the "Frente El Rincon". Otolith chemical composition has not been previously used in South America for identifying fish stocks and may be a simple, quick and useful tool for the sustainable exploitation and management of commercial species.

AB This paper presents a bio-economic analysis of the hand-line and gillnet coastal fisheries off Pernambuco State, north-eastern Brazil, in order to define management measures to support the decision-making process available to fisheries managers to reduce uncertainties about the sustainable development of the fisheries. The objective of applying a bio-economic model was to reproduce the biological and economic conditions in which the fisheries occur. This was done by carrying out projections and simulations, starting from the current situation and going forward into the future with the purpose of analysing the behaviour of the fishery under different conditions, particularly different management measures. Six scenarios are presented, defined by different management regimes: Scenario 1: increase in catchability; Scenario 2: reduction in fuel price; Scenario 3: closed season; Scenario 4: reduction in the number of active boats; Scenario 5: reduction of catches of juveniles; and Scenario 6: joint implementation of biological, economic and technical management strategies. Management events were always introduced in the fifth year of the simulation, with the exception of Scenario 1, in which the event was introduced in the first year. For each of the five scenarios, a deterministic simulation was carried out with a Beverton-Holt model of the stock-recruitment relationship. Simulations were carried forward through a 30-year period. The best management strategy, in biological and economic terms, seems to be the joint application of several management measures that satisfy the claims of stakeholders, and permit a biological and economic equilibrium between the activity and the efforts to rebuild stocks.

The analysis is mostly based on data from the Czech Survey on Social Conditions of Households (2001; 27,000 respondents); Eurostat data provide a benchmark for making international comparisons. The poverty rate in the Czech Republic is among the lowest in Europe. On the other hand, material deprivation, as well as concentration of poverty within specific population groups, is high, with the unemployed facing the highest risk of poverty. Social policy measures in effect reinforce this pattern: while the benefit system is highly redistributive and effectively eliminates income poverty among households of employed persons and among pensioners, incomes of persons outside paid employment are protected less effectively. Labour market policy measures are insufficient in scope and inadequate in targeting groups which are facing the highest risk of labour market exclusion and poverty. We argue that although this practice is effective at present, it is not sustainable in the long term.

AB New multimodel simulations of Bronze Age Mesopotamian settlement system dynamics, using advanced object-based simulation frameworks, are addressing fine-scale interaction of natural processes (crop growth, hydrology, etc.) and social processes (kinship-driven behaviors, farming and herding practices, etc.) on a daily basis across multi-enerational model runs. Key components of these simulations are representations of initial settlement populations that are demographically and socially plausible, and detailed models of social mechanisms that can produce and maintain realistic textures of social structure and dynamics over time. The simulation engine has broad applicability and is also being used to address modern problems such as agroeconomic sustainability in Southeast Asia. This article describes the simulation framework and presents results of initial studies, highlighting some social system representations.

AB Indoor air pollution (IAP) from household use of biomass and coal is a leading environmental health risk in many developing nations. Much of the initial research on household energy technology overlooked the complex interactions of technological, behavioral, economic, and infrastructural factors that determine the success of environmental health interventions. Consequently, despite enormous interest in reducing the large and inequitable risks associated with household energy use in international development and global health, there is limited empirical research to form the basis for design and delivery of effective interventions. We used data from four poor provinces in China (Gansu, Guizhou, Inner Mongolia, and Shaanxi) to examine the linkages among technology, user knowledge and behavior, and access and infrastructure in exposure to IAP from household energy use. We conclude that broad health risk education is insufficient for successful risk mitigation when exposure behaviors are closely linked to day-to-day activities of households such as cooking and heating, or have other welfare implications, and hence cannot be simply stopped. Rather, there should be emphasis on the economic and infrastructure determinants of access to technology, as well as the details of behaviors that affect exposure. Better understanding of technology-behavior interface would also allow designing technological interventions that account for, and are robust to, behavioral factors or to provide individuals and households with alternative behaviors. Based on the analysis, we present technological and behavioral interventions for these four Chinese provinces. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB There is now clear evidence for a prolonged increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations and enrichment of the biosphere with N. Understanding the fate of C in the plant-soil system under different CO2 and N regimes is therefore of considerable importance in predicting the environmental effects of climate change and in predicting the sustainability of ecosystems. Swards of Lolium perenne were grown from seed in a Eutric Cambisol at either ambient (ca. 350 mu mol mol(-1)) or elevated (700 mu mol mol(-1)) atmospheric pCO(2) and subjected to two inorganic N fertilizer regimes (no added N and 70 kg N ha(-1) month(-1)). After germination, soil solution concentrations of dissolved organic C (DOC), dissolved inorganic N (DIN), dissolved organic N (DON), phenolics and H+ were measured at five depths down the soil profile over 3 months. The exploration of soil layers down the soil profile by roots caused transient increases in soil solution DOC, DON and phenolic concentrations, which then subsequently returned to lower quasi-stable concentrations. In general, the addition of N tended to increase DOC and DON concentrations while exposure to elevated pCO(2) had the opposite effect. These treatment effects, however, gradually diminished over the duration of the experiment from the top of the soil profile downwards. The ambient PCO2 plus added N regime was the only treatment to maintain a notable difference in soil solution solute concentration, relative to other treatments. This effect on soil solution chemistry appeared to be largely indirect resulting from increased plant growth and a decrease in soil moisture content. Our results show that although plant growth responses to elevated PCO2 are critically dependent upon N availability, the organic chemistry of the soil solution is relatively insensitive to changes in plant growth once the plants have become established.

AB Biological nitrogen fixation plays a key role in agriculture sustainability, and assessment of rhizobial diversity contributes to worldwide knowledge of biodiversity of soil microorganisms, to the usefulness of rhizobial collections and to the establishment of long-term strategies aimed at increasing contributions of legume-fixed N to agriculture. Although in recent decades the use of molecular techniques has contributed greatly to enhancing knowledge of rhizobial diversity, concerns remain over simple issues such as the effects of sampling on estimates of diversity. In this study, rhizobia were isolated from nodules of plants grown under field conditions, in pots containing soil, or in Leonard jars receiving a 10(-2) or a 10(-4) serially-diluted soil inoculum, using one exotic (soybean, Glycine max) and one indigenous (common bean, Phaseolus vulgaris) legume species. The experiments were performed using an oxisol with a high population (10(5) cells g(-1) soil) of both soybean rhizobia, composed of naturalized strains introduced in inoculants and of indigenous common-bean rhizobia. BOX-PCR was used to evaluate strain diversity, while RFLP-PCR of the ITS (internally transcribed spacer) region with five restriction enzymes aimed at discriminating rhizobial species. In both analyses the genetic diversity of common-bean rhizobia was greater than that of soybean. For the common bean, diversity was greatly enhanced at the 10(-4) dilution, while for the soybean dilution decreased diversity. Qualitative differences were also observed, as the DNA profiles differed for each treatment in both host plants. Differences obtained can be attributed to dissimilarity in the history of the introduction of both the host plant and the rhizobia (exotic vs. indigenous), to host-plant specificity, rhizobial competitiveness, and population structure, including ease with which some types are released from microcolonies in soil. Therefore, sampling method should be considered both in the interpretation and comparison of the results obtained in different studies, and in the setting of the goals of any study, e.g. selection of competitive strains, or collection of a larger spectrum of rhizobia. Furthermore, effects of sampling should be investigated for each symbiosis. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study was conducted with sugar beet in greenhouse and field at two soil type with different organic matter (containing 2.4 and 15.9% OM, referred as the low- and high-OM soil) conditions in order to investigate seed inoculation of sugar beet, with five N-2-fixing and two phosphate solubilizing bacteria in comparison to control and mineral fertilizers (N and P) application. Three bacterial strains dissolved P; all bacterial strains fixed N-2 and significantly increased growth of sugar beet. In the greenhouse, inoculations with PGPR increased sugar beet root weight by 2.8-46.7% depending on the species. Leaf, root and sugar yield were increased by the bacterial inoculation by 15.5-20.8, 12.3-16.1, and 9.8-14.7%, respectively, in the experiment of low- and high-OM soil. Plant growth responses were variable and dependent on the inoculants strain, soil organic matter content, growing stage, harvest date and growth parameter evaluated. The effect of PGPR was greater at early growth stages than at the later. Effective Bacillus species, such as OSU-142, RC07 and M-13, Paenibacillus polymyxa RC05, Pseudomonas putida RC06 and Rhodobacter capsulatus RC04 may be used in organic and sustainable agriculture.

AB Under semi-arid Mediterranean conditions, limited moisture is the main constraint to rainfed cropping with wheat (Triticum aestivum), barley (Hordeum vulgare), and food and forage legumes. With increasing land-use pressure, moisture-conserving fallowing is being replaced by continuous cropping, which is considered an unsustainable practice. Thus, a long-term trial with durum wheat (T turgidum var. durum) was established in 1983 at Tel Hadya, Aleppo, Syria (mean annual rainfall 330 mm) to assess alternative rotation options to fallow and continuous cropping. Nitrogen (N) and grazing/residue management were secondary factors. Soil aggregation, infiltration, hydraulic conductivity, and total soil organic matter and component fractions (fulvic and humic acids and polysaccharides) were determined at the end of 12 years. Some rotations, e.g., medic (Medicago sativa) and vetch (Vicia faba), significantly increased soil organic matter (12.5-13.8 g kg(-1) versus 10.9-11 g kg(-1) for continuous wheat and wheat/fallow). All measurements, or indices, indicated parallel trends with increasing organic matter, e.g., coefficients of macro-structure, micro-aggregation, and water-stable aggregates, and decreasing dispersion. Similarly, legume rotations had higher infiltration rates (16.2-21.8 cm h(-1) versus 13.9-14.4 cm h(-1) with continuous wheat and wheat/fallow) and hydraulic conductivity rates (8.7-12.4 cm h(-1) versus 6.2-7.4 cm h(-1) with continuous wheat and wheat/fallow). We conclude that cereal/legume rotations, in addition to being biologically and economically attractive, also enhance soil quality and thus promote soil use sustainability in fragile semi-arid areas as in the Mediterranean zone.

AB The objective was to establish a minimum soil quality dataset for a long-term tillage, residue management and rotation trial for wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and maize (Zea mays L.) production systems. Based on this soil quality evaluation, sustainable management practices could be selected for transferring technologies to farmers in the region. A long-term experiment was conducted with 16 different crop management practices varying in: (1) rotation (continuous maize or wheat and both phases of the rotation of maize and wheat), (2) tillage (conventional and zero) and (3) crop residue management (full retention or removal for fodder). Superior soil quality was considered to represent the maintenance of high productivity without significant soil or environmental degradation. The pertinent, minimum soil quality data set included the following physical indicators: time-to-pond, aggregate stability, permanent wilting point, and topsoil penetration resistance. Chemical indicators were: soil C, N, K and Zn concentrations, measured in the 0-5 cm topsoil and C, N concentration in 5-20 cm. Multivariate analysis grouped the treatments into clusters: (1) zero tillage with retention of residue, (2) zero tillage with residue removal and (3) conventional tillage. Zero tillage combined with crop residue retention improved chemical and physical conditions of the soil. In contrast, zero tillage with removal of residues, led to high accumulation of Mn in the topsoil, low aggregate stability, high penetration resistance, surface slaking resulting in low time-to-pond values and high runoff. Finally, soil quality under conventional tillage was intermediate (irrespective of residue management), especially reflected in the physical status of the soil. The results provide a strong justification to promote zero tillage technology combined with appropriate residue management to farmers in the volcanic highlands of Central Mexico and other similar regions. The minimum data set and associated tools for careful monitoring and observation, will be essential for evaluating soil quality in farmer's fields. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Soil quality indicators (SQIs) can be used to evaluate sustainability of land use and soil management practices in agroecosystems. The objective of this study was to identify appropriate SQI from factor analysis (FA) of five treatments: no-till corn (Zee mays) without manure (NT), no-till corn with manure (NTM), no-till corn-soybean (Glycine max) rotation (NTR), conventional tillage corn (CT), and meadow (M) in Coshocton, Ohio. Soil properties were grouped into five factors (eigenvalues > 1) for the 0-10 cm depth as: (Factor 1) water transmission, (Factor 2) soil aeration, (Factor 3) soil pore connection 1, (Factor 4) soil texture and (Factor 5) moisture status. Factor 2 was the most dominant, with soil organic carbon (SOC) the most dominant measured soil attribute contributing to this factor. For the 10-20 cm depth, factors identified were: (Factor 6) soil aggregation, (Factor 7) soil pore connection 2, (Factor 8) soil macropore, and (Factor 9) plant production. At 1020 cm depth, Factor 6 was most dominant with SOC the most dominant measured soil attribute. Management x sample and slope position x sample interactions were significant among some factors for both depths. Overall, SOC was the most dominant measured soil attribute as a SQI for both depths. Other key soil attributes were field water capacity, air-filled porosity, pH and soil bulk density for the 0-10 cm depth, and total N and mean weight diameter of aggregates for the 10-20 depth. Therefore, SOC could play an important role for monitoring soil quality. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Effects of shelter belts on fence-line pacing of deer and associated

AB Sustainable land use for deer farming requires the maintenance of good soil and water quality, which can be adversely affected by fence-line pacing. This study tested the hypothesis that the absence or presence of shelter belts (one or two) in paddocks decreases fence-line pacing and associated soil and water quality impacts. Soils near the fence line and in the rest of the paddock, in paddocks containing zero, one or two shelter belts, were sampled for bulk density and macroporosity (pores > 30 mu m diameter). Large intact samples (1 x 0.2 x 0.1 m(3)) were used to generate overland flow via rainfall simulation. The flow was tested for nutrients [phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) fractions], suspended sediment (SS), and the faecal indicator bacteria, Escherichia coli. Results showed that bulk density, void volume, SS, particulate P and total P were affected by location (fence line or rest of paddock) but, along with all other measurements except E. coli, were not affected by the number of shelter belts. Thus, the inclusion of shelter had no effect on the concentration of contaminant lost in overland flow or any soil physical or hydrological parameter, but decreased the run-off of E. coli. The lack of contrast between the location of soils can be partly attributed to the soil type (Brown, NZ soil classification, USDA Taxonomy: Typic Fragiudalf), which when compared with past studies was less erosive and lost less P into solution. Other factors may have been different management or the lesser impact of weaners compared with older hinds and stags on soil properties. Although only E. coli concentrations were decreased by the inclusion of shelter, factors such as improved production and animal welfare weigh heavily in favour of installing and maintaining shelter on deer farms. However, the environmental benefit of shelter should be tested in other farms where factors such as slope, soil, climate and farm management may increase the contrast with no shelter.

AB Unethical practices and corruption issues have become one of the greatest challenges to Africans and their leaders, threatening to undermine economic growth, democratic stability and sustenance, and general developmental efforts. Against this background, this paper examines corruption perception in Africa using indicators of Transparency international as benchmark. The costs of corruption to the continent's progress were highlighted. The paper also focuses on Botswana's efforts to fight corruption through its Directorate on Corruption and Economic Crime (DCEC). The factors that have aided the qualified successes of the anti-corruption efforts as well as lessons that may be learnt by other African countries are discussed.

ID MODEL
AB In the large inland extensions of the Spanish Mediterranean, dry-farming is predominant and the main crops are olive, vine and almond. These species represent an agricultural activity that is fundamental to the continued inhabitation of these regions. The aim of this work is to determine the chances this agriculture has of continuing by following criteria of sustainability. Having chosen goals of an economic, social and environmental nature, almost-ideal cropping plans are obtained using the Compromise Programming. Moreover, given the important role played by water availability in this type of agriculture, the study is completed by determining the impact that an irrigation-water pricing policy would have, as outlined in the European Water Framework Directive. The study leads to the conclusion that, increasing mechanization may be the most straightforward strategy to ensure the sustainability of farms in Spanish dry-lands, and specially if the current trend of increasing irrigation-water prices is consolidated.

AB Nitrogen is often a limiting nutrient, therefore the sustainability of food crops, forages and green manure legumes is mainly associated with their ability to establish symbiotic associations with stem and root-nodulating N-2-fixing rhizobia. The selection, identification and maintenance of elite strains for each host are critical. Decades of research in Brazil resulted in a list of strains officially recommended for several legumes, but their genetic diversity is poorly known. This study aimed at gaining a better understanding of phylogenetic relationships of 68 rhizobial strains recommended for 64 legumes, based on the sequencing of the 16S rRNA genes. The strains were isolated from a wide range of legumes, including all three subfamilies and 17 tribes. Nine main phylogenetic branches were defined, seven of them related to the rhizobial species: Bradyrhizobium japonicum, B. elkanii, Rhizobium tropici, R. leguminosarum, Sinorhizobium meliloti/S fredii, Mesorhizobium ciceri/M. loti, and Azorhizobium caulinodans. However, some strains differed by up to 35 nucleotides from the type strains, which suggests that they may represent new species. Two other clusters included bacteria showing similarity with the genera Methylobacterium and Burkholderia, and amplification with primers for nifH and/or nodC regions was achieved with these strains. Host specificity of several strains was very low, as they were capable of nodulating legumes of different tribes and subfamilies. Furthermore, host specificity was not related to 16S rRNA, therefore evolution of ribosomal and symbiotic genes may have been diverse. Finally, the great diversity observed in this study emphasizes that tropics are an important reservoir of N-2-fixation genes. (c) 2006 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB Sustainable natural resource use requires that multiple actors reassess their situation in a systemic perspective. This can be conceptualised as a social learning process between actors from rural communities and the experts from outside organisations. A specifically designed workshop oriented towards a systemic view of natural resource use and the enhancement of mutual learning between local and external actors, provided the background for evaluating the potentials and constraints of intensified social learning processes. Case studies in rural communities in India, Bolivia, Peru and Mali showed that changes in the narratives of the participants of the workshop followed a similar temporal sequence relatively independently from their specific contexts. Social learning processes were found to be more likely to be successful if they 1) opened new space for communicative action, allowing for an intersubjective re-definition of the present situation, 2) contributed to rebalance the relationships between social capital and social, emotional and cognitive competencies within and between local and external actors.

AB New technologies often give rise to previously unknown ethical problems, and it often takes many years to fully integrate them in society. We propose a new form of technology assessment that will focus on the ethical implications of new technologies; ethical technology assessment (eTA). Ethical technology assessment will serve as a tool for identifying adverse effects of new technologies at an early stage. It should be undertaken in dialogue with technology developers and have the form of a continuous dialogue rather than a single evaluation at a specific point in time. eTA can be conducted on the basis of a check-list that refers to nine crucial ethical aspects of technology; (1) Dissemination and use of information, (2) Control, influence and power, (3) Impact on social contact patterns, (4) Privacy, (5) Sustainability, (6) Human reproduction, (7) Gender, minorities and justice, (8) International relations, and (9) Impact on human values. Ethical technology assessments should not be committed to any particular moral theory. Instead they should be open to different perspectives and solutions. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In spite of the emphasis in public policy and the professional literature on developing inclusive programs for students with disabilities over the past 30 years, surprisingly little progress has been made in this regard in school districts across the United States. One approach to change that is currently being used with some success in general education and that has shown promise for developing more inclusive schools is comprehensive school reform (CSR). This article provides a brief description of an approach to CSR that has been used to develop programs that support a diverse range of students, including students with disabilities in general education classrooms. Preliminary research on this approach to school change suggests that CSR has the potential to provide teachers and administrators with a framework to develop successful, sustainable inclusive programs.

AB OBJECTIVE In Uganda, formal and informal private practitioners (PPs) provide most case management for childhood illness. This paper describes the impact of negotiation sessions, an intervention to improve the quality of PPs' case management of childhood diarrhoea, acute respiratory infection and malaria in a rural district in Uganda.
   METHOD Negotiation sessions targeted PPs working at private clinics and drug shops. The aim was to improve key practices extracted from the national Integrated Management of Childhood Illness Guidelines, and to measure the PPs' performance before and after the intervention.
   RESULTS Post-intervention the quality of case management for childhood diarrhoea, acute respiratory infection and malaria was generally better, although certain practices appeared resistant to change. We discovered various types of PPs who were mostly unregistered by the district authorities.
   CONCLUSIONS Results suggest the importance of maintaining ongoing monitoring and support to PPs to understand barriers to change and to encourage more practice improvement. Modifications to the intervention are needed to take it to scale and render it more sustainable. Getting local organizations and professional associations more involved could make it easier to establish and maintain contact with PPs. The government needs to simplify registration procedures and reduce associated fees to encourage PPs to register and thus be included in a large-scale intervention. Future interventions need to measure the impact on improving childhood case management at the community/household level.

AB This paper deals with wastewater management in Harare, in the Lake Chivero catchment area of Zimbabwe. It aims at developing a sustainable system for managing water and nutrients and is based on the literature and a water quality monitoring Study conducted from June 2000 to December 2001. This study has shown serious water pollution problems due to urbanisation in the catchment. A 1 three-step strategic approach' 10 urban (waste)water management was used as a basis for formulating solutions. The short-term Solutions include reduction of wastewater volume in industries and households, reducing wastewater flows by 24% and total phosphorus by 5%. The medium-term solutions involve treating wastewater to high standards, resource recovery and reuse, and controlling upstream sources of pollution, and thus would reduce the lake total nitrogen and total phosphorus levels to about 0.4 and 0.07 mg/L, respectively. A long-term solution was suggested based on pollution prevention and direct reuse, treatment at onsite and decentralised levels followed by reuse, and minimal disposal of the remaining effluents combined with the stimulation of the self-purification capacity of the receiving rivers. it was concluded that it is feasible to reduce pollution levels in the catchment by applying these phased developments.

   systems approach
AB The governments of the Aral Sea Basin countries, in cooperation with international, organizations (UNESCO and World Bank) came up with a "water vision" for the region until 2025. The landlocked Aral Sea has been suffering from an imbalance in water evaporation, and, water inflow from its two main sources - Amu Darya and Syr Darya rivers, when the planners in the former Soviet Union from the 1960s diverted the river waters for irrigation. The irrigated area has increased from the 1960s by two-thirds to 7 million hectares and the population by three-fold to 50 million in the basin countries, Consequently the inflow to the Aral Sea from these two rivers decreased from 55 km(3) in 1960 to a few km(3). during the 1980s and 1990s. This has resulted in one of the worst man-made ecological disasters of the century. In this paper, we examine different scenarios to achieve the vision goals and whether it is indeed feasible. Using IWMI basin-oriented water accounting principles, we have shown that significant amount of water is being wasted in the region. Our analysis concludes that though not all the vision goals are likely to be met over the next 25 years, the inflow into the Aral Sea can be increased to over 26, km(3) through better management and use of water resources.

AB San Antonio Bay is located on the coast of Texas between Galveston Bay and Corpus Christi Bay and is the primary bay in the Guadalupe Estuary. Three rivers feed San Antonio Bay from two river basins, including the Blanco and Guadalupe Rivers in the Guadalupe River Basin and the San Antonio River in the San Antonio River Basin. The Canyon Reservoir regulates the flow of fresh water in the middle and lower reaches of the Guadalupe River These inflows are a primary regulator of salinity and, thus,,the productivity of commercially important estuarine species. Increasing demand for water has prompted plans for an increased diversion of 49.3 million m(3) (40, 000 acre-feet) from the reservoir An additional amount of 61.6 million m(3) (50,000 acre-feet) from the mouth of the river is to be pumped back to, San Antonio to relieve over-pumping of the Edwards Aquifer. Because the Guadalupe River Basin contributes 58.1 percent of the freshwater inflow to the estuary, it is not known what the impact of these actions will have on the ecological integrity of the San Antonio Bay. Water resource management in the San Antonio Basin consists of decision making under risk and uncertainty related to randomness in the critical parameters such as the salinity in the bay, biological productivity, and total flow into the bay. The aim of this study is to investigate the trade-offs between the competing objectives of maximizing biological,productivity in the bay and minimizing flow using Stochastic Compromise Programming (SCP). The SCP model solves a multi-objective function subject to constraints that must be maintained at three different Prescribed levels of probability providing a global set of solutions for the water resource management problem under input uncertainty. The SCP model provides information on the trade-offs among the objective function value, tolerance values of the constraint at the prescribed levels of probability, which could be valuable to policy makers in risk assessment. Solutions were found using three distance functions. Model outputs may suggest the minimum amount of freshwater needed to maximize biological productivity of the bay at specified risk level for assessing the impact of upcoming diversion program. Results indicate that current flows in the Guadalupe River are of sufficient volume to satisfy harvest requirements.

AB An integrated population, economic, and water resource model was developed to address sustainable development questions for Botswana. Traditionally, water resources planning models have considered the implications of different assumptions of population and economic growth on the sustainability of existing water resources supply; however this model extends that capability to consider feedbacks from one model component to. another For example, the model has the unique capability to examine implications of changing water-related diarrhea incidence on the health of the HIV/AIDS population. Investments in water supply and sanitation or in HIV/AIDS medication impact the health and productivity of the population. The water model uses a physically-based hydrologic rainfall-runoff model with surface and groundwater components to produce monthly runoff and groundwater recharge at the watershed scale. Botswana is divided into socioeconomic regions, and the water resources infrastructure is characterized by virtual reservoirs in each. The demographic sub-model is a standard multi-cohort model that forecasts the population by age, sex, rural or urban residence, education level, and HIV/AIDS, health, economic, and water conservation scenarios, whose output is probabilistic in nature. The three model components are described, with particular emphasis on the model linkages and the water sub-component, and results are shown for a variety of scenarios.

AB Irrigation management is among the key factors for the sustainability of irrigated agriculture. In Turkey, irrigation management is becoming increasingly important due to the scarcity of water resources and degrading environmental conditions. In this paper, we compiled a large data set that compromise of water supply, crop types, crop water requirement, and irrigated and command areas that are SHW-operated (State Hydraulic Works) and transferred irrigation schemes (the schemes transferred from SHW to non-profit organizations, i.e., water users' associations) for the five years (1996 to 2000). This data set was used to calculate two irrigation performance indicators: Irrigation ratio (IR) and relative water supply (RWS). ANOVA test results indicated that the differences in the IR and RWS among the years were statistically not significant, whereas a statistically significant difference was found between the SHW-operated and transferred irrigation schemes. The average values of the irrigation ratios for the transferred irrigation schemes were always higher than that of the SHW-operated schemes, but the opposite was true for the RWS. This suggest that the transfer of the SHW-operated schemes to the water use associations must be initiated and encouraged, in addition to the set up of legal procedures for participatory irrigation management, in order to cope with the possible operation and maintenance (O&M) problems of irrigation schemes.

AB Integrating human knowledge with modeling tools, an intelligent decision support system (DSS) is developed to assist decision makers during different phases of flood management. The DSS is developed as a virtual planning tool and can address both engineering and non-engineering issues related to flood management. Different models (hydrodynamic, forecasting, and economic) that are part of the DSS share data and communicate with each other by providing feedback. The DSS is able to assist in: selecting suitable flood damage reduction options (using an expert system approach); forecasting floods (using artificial neural networks approach); modeling the operation of flood control structures; and describing the impacts (area flooded and damage) of floods in time and space. The proposed DSS is implemented for the Red River Basin in Manitoba, Canada. The results from the test application of DSS for 1997 flood in the Red River Basin are very promising. The DSS is able to predict the peak flows with 2% error and reveals that with revised operating rules the contribution of Assiniboine River to the flooding of Winnipeg city can be significantly reduced. The decision support environment allows a number of "what-if" type questions to be asked and answered, thus, multiple decisions can be tried without having to deal with the real life consequences.

TI Managing surface water contamination in Nagoya, Japan: An integrated

ID QUALITY; RISK
AB The water quality of rivers in Japan has received greater attention in recent years due to a number of factors, including human-induced land subsidence and an increase in water demand. Surface waters are adversely affected by high frequency, low level risks (such as the continuous release of hazardous substances) and less frequent, high impact risks (such as the release of chemicals due to natural disasters or industrial accidents). This paper puts forth an integrated Water Basin Management (WBM) decision framework to study the latter: these relatively infrequent, but often catastrophic hazards, are less well-studied than the more familiar high frequency, low level risks. The six main components of this WBM decision framework involve (a) determining possible threats to surface waters; (b) identifying surface waters most at risk to contamination; (c) identifying weaknesses (gaps) in current monitoring systems; (d) using accident analysis to determine proactive WBM; (e) analyzing the temporal-spatial impact of policies on water basins, (f) designing new policies and approaches for integrated WBM. Japan's recently published Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (PRTR) is used to develop a WBM decision framework for managing surface water contamination in Nagoya, Japan. Participatory surface water management is emphasized in order to achieve a holistic and sustainable WBM decision making process.

TI Asymmetric information on the provision of irrigation through a public
   infrastructure: The case of the Peninsula of Santa Elena, Ecuador
SO WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT

DT Article

   costly access
AB This paper analyzes the problem of irrigation provision through a public infrastructure in an environment of Asymmetric Information (AI) in a dry area of Ecuador. Due to mismanagement of information and bad definition of goals by the government, a massive interest in acquiring communal lands started in the Peninsula of Santa Elena (PSE) after the government announced the construction plan of a large public irrigation system. During this process, information asymmetries regarding the potential of the irrigation system always prevailed in favor of land buyers. After eight years of functioning of the irrigation system, less than 20 percent of its capacity is in use. This leads to a situation in which the operation and maintenance of the canals is not appropriate, thus endangering sustainability of agriculture itself. This paper starts from the hypothesis that AI has an important impact over the observed pattern of land use and therefore irrigation in the PSE. Under the condition of AI for public goods with costly access, a test was conducted to determine which of the characteristics for an optimal allocation fits in the case of the PSE. Farmer's marginal cost of access to irrigation in connection with the concentration of the property of land by new landholders is considered the relevant informational variable. The most important result of this paper is that the presence of AI induces a scenario in which new landholders demand a smaller quantity of irrigation because of the high marginal costs of farming on big farm plots. A second important result suggests that subsidies to new landowners through the provision of irrigation appear to increase inequality with respect to peasant-commoners.

AB Changes in summer irrigated cropland acreage and related water use are estimated from satellite remote sensing and ancillary data in semi-arid Southeastern Turkey where traditionally dry agricultural lands are being rapidly transformed into irrigated fields with the help of water from the Euphrates-Tigris Rivers. An image classification methodology based on thresholding of Landsat NDVI images from the peak summer period reveals that the total area of summer irrigated crops has increased three-fold (from 35,000 ha to over 100,000) in the Harran Plain between 1993 and 2002. Coupled analysis of annual irrigated crop area from remote sensing and potential evapotranspiration based estimates of irrigation water requirements for cotton indicate a corresponding increase in agricultural water use from about 370 million cubic meters to over one billion cubic meters, a volume in accordance with the state estimates. These estimates have important implications for understanding the rapid changes in current agricultural withdrawals in Southeastern Turkey and form a quantitative basis for exploring the changes in future water demands in the region. For example, expansion of irrigated lands have led to a steady decrease in potential evaporation due to increased roughness and decreased humidity deficit in the Harran Plain. Assuming that the changes in future evaporation conditions will be of similar nature, water use for irrigation is expected to decrease over 40 percent in future irrigation sites. Incorporating this decrease in overall planning of the irrigation projects currently under construction should lead to improved management, and by extension, sustainability of water resources in the region.

AB It is an axiom in ecology that knowing the sheer number of individuals in a population is of very little help if the objective is to understand future and past changes in population size. Yet, this is exactly how migratory European ducks are monitored, many of which are important quarry species in several countries. We argue that present monitoring is insufficient to address objectives of wise use and sustainability such as those emphasised in recent management directives and multilateral international agreements. The two main problems are the almost total lack of reliable data on recruitment and mortality. We advocate a pan-European monitoring system based on undisputed scientific principles; i.e. a long-term, coordinated and standardised scheme that produces data about vital rates of duck populations as well as about harvest size. Data from such a scheme can be used by game biologists to produce predictive tools, thus providing a functional basis for management decisions for adaptive harvesting and conservation alike.

ID DIVERSITY
AB Mexico's wildlife has been impacted by human land use changes and socioeconomic and political factors since before the Spanish conquest in 1521. Presently, it has been estimated that more than 60% of the land area has been severely degraded. Mexico ranks in the top 3 countries in biodiversity, is a plant and faunal dispersal corridor, and is a crucial element in the conservation and management of North American wildlife. Wildlife management prerogatives and regulatory powers reside in the federal government with states relegated a minimum role. The continuous shifting of federal agencies responsible for wildlife management with the concomitant lack of adequate federal funding has not permitted the establishment of a robust wildlife program. In addition, wildlife conservation has been further impacted by a failure to establish landowner incentives, power struggles over user rights, resistance to change, and lack of trust and experience in protecting and managing Mexico's wildlife. We believe future strategies for wildlife programs must take into account Mexico's highly diversified mosaic of ecosystems, cultures, socioeconomic levels, and land tenure and political systems. The private sector, along with communal properties, in cooperation with federal and municipal governments, nongovernmental organizations, corporations, and international agencies may have the greatest potential of sustainable management of Mexico's wildlife. The present federal wildlife management strategy is an initial positive effort because it promotes participatory wildlife conservation by key stakeholders. We identify the aspects of this strategy that we believe will be needed to establish a sustainable program to manage Mexico's wildlife.

AB Background: The main goal of the Essential Trauma Care (EsTC) project is to promote affordable and sustainable improvements in trauma care, on the ground in individual countries and their health care facilities. This has been occurring in several countries, including Ghana.
   Results: The EsTC project has helped to solidify previously haphazard interactions between stakeholders from different sectors. It has allowed trauma care clinicians to interact more effectively with other groups, such as the Ministry of Health and the WHO country office. It has allowed the clinicians and other stakeholders to more effectively lobby government for increased attention to trauma care services. These interactions have led to a high-profile stakeholders meeting, the Road Safety and Essential Trauma Care Workshop, which has represented the highest level of attention to trauma care in the country thus far. This meeting has generated a set of policy recommendations, which has been presented to Parliament for study, and, it is hoped, adoption.
   Conclusions: To convert these recommendations to solid, sustainable action in improving care for the injured, we need to continue to engage in advocacy and to work with Parliament, the Ministry of Health, and other stakeholders, as well as to confront the deeper problems of Ghana's brain drain, civil strife, and poverty.

AB The publication Guidelines for Essential Trauma Care offers an opportunity to improve trauma care services in an affordable and sustainable fashion, primarily through improved organization and planning. The publication will be useful, however, only if it actually catalyzes improvements in trauma care in health care facilities in individual countries, especially those low- and middle-income countries with the greatest needs. There is much that can be done to make this happen on the part of the partners that created these recommendations, including IATSIC (international Association for Trauma Surgery and Intensive Care); ISS-SIC (International Society of Surgery-Societe Internationale de Chirurgie); and WHO (World Health Organization). This includes such activities as organizing multi-sectoral stakeholders' meetings to adapt the Essential Trauma Care (EsTC) criteria to local needs; conducting trauma care needs assessments to identify priorities for low-cost improvements; having surgical colleges and societies throughout the world endorse the Guidelines; lobbying ministries of health to incorporate the EsTC recommendations into health policy; and seeking to integrate the EsTC recommendations into the 2-year action plans of WHO country offices. In all of these activities, surgeons and others who care for the injured can play a pivotal role, especially working collaboratively with their own ministries of health and WHO country offices.

AB Background: We sought to identify affordable and sustainable methods to strengthen trauma care capabilities globally, especially in developing countries, using the Guidelines for Essential Trauma Care. These guidelines were created by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Society of Surgery and provide recommendations on elements of trauma care that should be in place at the range of health facilities globally.
   Methods: The guidelines were used as a basis for needs assessments in 4 countries selected to represent the world's range of geographic and economic conditions: Mexico (middle income; Latin America); Vietnam (low income; east Asia); India (low income; south Asia); and Ghana (low income; Africa). One hundred sites were assessed, including rural clinics (n = 51), small hospitals (n = 34), and large hospitals (n = 15). Site visits utilized direct inspection and interviews with administrative and clinical staff.
   Results: Resources were partly adequate or adequate at most large hospitals, but there were gaps that could be improved, especially in low-income settings, such as shortages of airway equipment, chest tubes, and trauma-related medications; and prolonged periods where critical equipment (e.g., X-ray, laboratory) were unavailable while awaiting repairs. Rural clinics everywhere had difficulties with basic supplies for resuscitation even though some received significant trauma volumes. In all settings, there was a dearth of administrative functions to assure quality trauma care, including trauma registries, trauma-related quality improvement programs, and regular in-service training.
   Conclusions: This study identified several low-cost ways in which to strengthen trauma care globally. It also has demonstrated the usefulness of the Guidelines for Essential Trauma Care in providing an internationally applicable, standardized template by which to assess trauma care capabilities.

   optimal-stocking model
ID MORPHOEDAPHIC INDEX; FISH YIELDS; MACROPHYTES; CRUSTACEA
AB The fanning of Chinese mitten crab, a quality aquatic product in China and neighbouring Asian countries, has been developing rapidly in China since last decade. It reached a total yield of 3.4 X 10(5) tonnes in 2002. Due to the successive over-stocking year after year, many lakes in the mid-lower Yangtze Basin, the main farming area, are under deterioration, leading to a reduction of crab yield and quality, and, subsequently, a loss of fanning profits. Aiming at a normal development of crab culture and the sustainable use of lakes, an annual investigation dealing with lake environmental factors in relation to stocked crab populations was carried out at 20 farms in 4 lakes. The results show that the submersed macrophyte biomass (B-Mac) is the key factor affecting annual crab yield (CY). Using the ratio of Secchi depth to mean depth (Z(SD)/Z(M)), an easily measured parameter closely correlated to BMac, as driving variable, 10 regression models of maximal crab yields were generated (r(2) ranging 0.49-0.81). Based on the theory of MSY (Maximum Sustainable Yield), in combination with body-weight (BW) and recapture rate (RR) of adult crabs, a general optimal stocking model was eventually formulated. All models are simple and easy to operate. Comments on their applications and prospects are given in brief. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The site in question lies in a highly industrial area of East London where widespread and varied contamination is present in many areas as a result of historical and current activities. This is further compounded by the high sensitivity of the underlying groundwater (inner groundwater protection zone) and the proximity of the River Lea, which lies along the eastern boundary of the site.
   The site encompasses an area of approximately 0.3 ha. Site investigation undertaken between June and August 2002 confirmed the presence of 3 to 4 m of highly contaminated Made Ground, with groundwater present in the underlying River Terrace Deposits at 2.5 to 3 m below ground level. Soil chemical analyses indicate highly elevated soil concentrations of heavy metals and organics. Groundwater contaminants comprise both inorganics and organics.
   Based on the findings of the ground investigations, it was considered that the most economically and environmentally sustainable remediation solution for the site was the use of an Active Containment System (ACS) in the form of a cut-off wall extending into the deep impermeable clays of the Lambeth Group. Active sections, placed at upstream and downstream locations, comprise activated clay to immobilise and absorb both organic and inorganic pollutants in groundwater whilst maintaining a permeability similar to the site geology to limit impacts on the local hydrogeological regime. A Remediation Method Statement for the site was submitted to the Environment Agency in October 2003.
   This article outlines the background to the site and the reasoning behind the use of an ACS. In addition, it describes the details, constraints and general procedures required for the installation and design of such a system. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE erosion; GIS; Jamni River; soil; universal soil loss equation; watershed
AB The present study uses the universal soil loss equation (USLE) developed by the United States Department of Agriculture, Agriculture Research Service, to predict soil erosion from a watershed. The land cover/landuse data at village level is collected from the Revenue Department, and detailed soil data from the All India Soil and Landuse Survey, New Delhi, are used in USLE for determining soil erosion rate. MapInfo Professional Version 5.5 GIS Software has been used as a platform for spatial data analysis required in the USLE. The potential soil loss has been estimated and mapped. Maps covering each parameter were integrated to generate a composite map of erosion intensity based on advanced GIS functionality. The map is expected to assist in the identification of priority areas of the basin and would thus help in future planning of a watershed and its sustainable development.

AB We examined production and consumption patterns of freshwater, a critical ecosystem service, for selected cities in China and the United States. Ecosystem production of freshwater varies with precipitation and evapotranspiration rates, which are affected by climate, topography, vegetation cover, and soil characteristics. Urban demand for freshwater is spatially distributed due to the location of cities, the variation in the per-capita usage, and the variation in urban population size. To link the spatially heterogeneous patterns of cities and ecosystem service production rates we calculated heterogeneous ecological footprints (HEF) of the land area required to provide urban freshwater needs. We asked, what determines urban freshwater footprint area in cities of the United States and China? Are the same factors operating in the same fashion in both countries? Our results show the strong interaction between population size and local resource production in determining footprint. These results suggest extending the I=PAT identity to include a term describing local ecosystem service productivity in the determination of human impact. By using the ecological footprint methodology in this manner, we can address questions concerning the relationship between social and ecological systems and identify urban-scale constraints to the sustainable withdrawal of a particular ecosystem service.

AB In this paper, we conceptualize the difference among risk, uncertainty and ignorance and focus on a theoretical analysis of "modeling relation" applied to self-modifying systems within the framework of post-normal science. We provide an overview of the concept of risk and uncertainty elaborating on the work of F. Knight. We extend R. Rosen's theory of "modeling relation" originally aimed in natural science to the issue of science for governance. Knight's analysis of risk and uncertainty can be used to generate a list of various types of uncertainty involved in every stage to model self-modifying systems. Such a list is relevant for gaining insight into the issue of science for governance. It is important for those attempting to model sustainability, especially in the field of ecological economics, to be aware of the theoretical difference between models and similes for self-modifying systems.

AB This study reports results from a double-bounded dichotomous choice contingent valuation method (DC-CVM) and choice experiment (CE) study that aimed to examine Macao residents' preferences for alternative solid waste management policy changes in Macao. An empirical comparison of the welfare measures derived from the double-bounded DC-CVM and CE is conducted. There is no significant difference found between the values derived from the two methods. The results suggest that both double-bounded DC-CVM and CE can be successfully implemented for environmental valuation in Macao. This paper could provide the basis for further development of useful ideas on sustainable management of solid waste in Macao. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID ECOSYSTEMS; ENVIRONMENT; DYNAMICS; IMPACTS
AB A static bioeconomic model of a marine reserve allowing asymmetric density dependent migration between the reserve and the fishable area is introduced. This opens for habitat or ecosystem differences allowing different fish densities within and outside a reserve, not described in earlier studies. Four management scenarios are studied; (a) maximum harvest, (b) maximum current profit, (c) open access and (d) maximum sustainable yield (MSY) in the reserve. These are all analysed within the Induced Sustainable Yield Function (ISYF), giving the relationship between the fish abundance inside the reserve and the harvesting taking place outside. A numerical analysis shows that management focused on ensuring MSY within the reserve under the assumption of symmetric migration may be negative from an economic point of view, when the area outside the reserve is detrimental compared to the reserve. Furthermore, choice of management option may also have negative consequences for long run resource use if it is incorrectly assumed that density dependent migration is symmetric. The analysis also shows that the optimal area to close, either a more or a less attractive ecosystem for the resource in question, may differ depending on the management goal. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

TI A waste input-output life-cycle cost analysis of the recycling of

SO ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS

DE LCC; LCA; electric appliances; recycling; Design for Disassembly
AB However excellent a product may be environmentally, it would not come into wide use in the economy to realize its environmental load reducing potential unless it is also economically affordable. Life-cycle costing (LCC) is a tool to assess the cost of a product over its entire life cycle, and can be regarded as an economic counterpart of LCA. A combined use of LCA and LCC would be imperative for assessing the sustainability of a product or product systems in the economy. This paper presents a new methodology of LCC which gives the cost and price counterpart of the hybrid LCA tool (Waste Input-Output, WIO) that was developed by Nakamura and Kondo (2002) [Nakamura, S., Kondo, Y., 2002. Input-output analysis of waste management. Journal of Industrial Ecology 6 (1), 39-63.1]for LCA of waste management. Building upon the preceding LCA study by Kondo and Nakamura (2004) [Kondo, Y., Nakamura, S., 2004. Evaluating alternative life-cycle strategies for electrical appliances by the waste input-output model. International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment 9 (4), 236-246.], the applicability of the methodology is illustrated by a case study of electric appliances under alternative end-of-life scenarios: landfilling, intensive recycling that is consistent with the Japanese law on the recycling of appliances, and an advanced form of intensive recycling augmented by Design for Disassembly (DfD). Application of the proposed LCC methodology indicates that while the life-cycle cost is the highest under intensive recycling and the lowest under landfilling, the cost of recycling can be reduced by appropriate implementation of MD. The possible introduction of a carbon tax is also found to significantly reduce the cost disadvantage of recycling against landfilling. Given the high level of environmental load associated with landfilling and the possible introduction of carbon taxes, Design for Environment or EcoDesign emerges as a strategy of vital importance to achieve the sustainability of appliances.

AB A series of semi-interpenetrating, polymer network (semi-IPN), hydrogel beads, composed of calcium alginate (Ca-alginate) and poly(N-isoproplyacrylamide) (PNIPAAM), were prepared for a pH/temperature-sensitive drug delivery study. The equilibrium swelling showed the independent pH- and thermo- responsive nature of the developed materials. At pH=2.1, the release amount of indomethacin incorporated into these beads was about 10% within 400 min, while this value approached to 95% at pH=7.4. The release rate of the drug was higher at 37 degrees C than at 25 degrees C and increased slightly with increasing PNIPAAM content. These results suggest that the Ca-alginate/PNIPAAM beads have the potential to be used as an effective pH/temperature sustainable delivery system of bioactive agents.

AB Estimates of the global extent of irrigation-induced soil salinity vary, but there is widespread agreement that the twin menaces of waterlogging and salinisation represent serious threats to the sustainability of irrigated agriculture in many and and semi-arid regions. In certain circumstances, the conventional drainage solution may be questionable due to economic and/or environmental limitations and "dry drainage" has been postulated as an alternative. It involves the allocation of areas of fallow land, which operate as evaporative sinks drawing a stable flux of water and salt from irrigated areas. An evaluation of the merit of this approach requires answers to three key questions: (i) What is the limiting crop intensity? (ii) What is the limiting watertable depth? (iii) what is the long-term impact of salt accumulation in the drainage sink area? A simulation model was developed to investigate these questions for a dry-drainage system with a wheat-cotton cropping pattern using published data for the Lower Indus Basin in Pakistan, where shallow saline watertables, intensive irrigation, high evaporative demand and natural dry drainage exist. The simulation results showed that dry drainage could satisfy the necessary water and salt balance when the cropped area and sink area were approximately equal and watertable depth was around 1.5 m. The long-term impact of salt accumulation on the performance of the system was also considered. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Higher yields and reduced pesticide impacts are needed to mitigate the effects of agricultural intensification. A 2-year farm-scale evaluation of 81 commercial fields in Arizona show that use of transgenic Bacillus thuringiensis (Et) cotton reduced insecticide use, whereas transgenic cotton with Bt protein and herbicide resistance (BtHr) did not affect herbicide use. Transgenic cotton had higher yield than nontransgenic cotton for any given number of insecticide applications. However, nontransgenic, Bt and BtHr cotton had similar yields overall, largely because higher insecticide use with nontransgenic cotton improved control of key pests. Unlike Bt and BtHr cotton, insecticides reduced the diversity of nontarget insects. Several other agronomic and ecological factors also affected biodiversity. Nevertheless, pairwise comparisons of diversity of nontarget insects in cotton fields with diversity in adjacent noncultivated sites revealed similar effects of cultivation of transgenic and nontransgenic cotton on biodiversity. The results indicate that impacts of agricultural intensification can be reduced when replacement of broad-spectrum insecticides by narrow-spectrum Bt crops does not reduce control of pests not affected by Bt crops.

AB Despite general agreement that global climate change is taking place there is less consensus about the consequences and impacts that may arise. The possibility of greater climatic variability, with changes in the incidence of particular types of events, requires multidisciplinary research so that associated impacts can be considered when devising environmental management strategies. Past hydrological events investigated using palaeoenvironmental techniques, over time periods longer than the period of continuous records, are a possible source of information to complement monitored records. Six international research groups (GLOCOPH Commission of INQUA, Water Sustainability Commission of IGU, LUCIFS in IGBP-PAGES, Geomorphic Challenges for the 21st Century Commission of IGU, International Commission on Continental Erosion of IAHS, and Fluvial Archives Group [FLAG] associated with INQUA and IGU) have each contributed results from their specific time and spatial scales in integrated research collaboration. Relevant research conclusions have been combined and a research project under-taken which is the subject of four later papers. A provisional protocol for use of past hydrological events in order to understand global change is proposed and adapted in the final paper, to take account of other papers included and contributions to the discussions.

AB Ecosystems often exhibit transitions between multiple dynamic regimes (or steady states), such as the conversion of oligotrophic to eutrophic conditions and associated aquatic ecological communities, due to natural (or increasingly) anthropogenic disturbances. As ecosystems experience perturbations of varying regularity and intensity, they may either remain within the state space neighborhood of the current regime or neighborhood of a regime with different characteristics. An increasingly integral aspect of many ecological, economic, and social decisions is their impact on the sustainability of particular dynamic regimes of ecosystems. Sustainability entails a human preference for one particular regime versus another, and the persistence of that regime with regard to the human and natural perturbations exacted on the system.
   Information theory has significantly advanced our ability to quantify the organizational complexity inherent in systems despite imperfect observations or 'signals' from the source system. Fisher Information is one of several measures developed under the theme of estimation theory. Fisher Information can be described in three ways: as a measure of the degree to which a parameter (or state of a system) can be estimated; as a measure of the relative amount of information that exists between different states of a system; as a measure of the disorder or chaos of a system. Fisher Information maybe a useful measure to identify the degree to which a system is at risk of "flipping" into a different dynamic regime. We developed a Fisher Information index for dynamic systems in a periodic steady state and applied it to a simple, two species Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model. Changes in the carrying capacity (size) of the system resulted in different stable steady states establishing themselves, each with a characteristic Fisher information. By repeatedly calculating Fisher information over time, transitions or "flips" between steady states were identified with changes in Fisher information. We then examined data collected from four ecological systems (of increasingly large spatial and temporal scale) that have demonstrated regime transitions: the Bering Strait/Pacific Ocean food web; the western Africa savanna; the Florida (USA) pine-oak system; the global climate system. These datasets are noisy and reflect several to many cycles that are out of phase, which complicates the identification of both dynamic regimes and transitions. If transition phases between regimes can be detected early enough, human activity suspected of contributing to regime changes can be altered (or continued if the resultant steady state is desirable, such as in ecosystem restoration efforts).
