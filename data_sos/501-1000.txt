AB The aim of this article is to study how policy learning has led to new understandings of ways to support renewable energies, based on experience in the wind power sector. Drawing on analysis of the literature and informed by field-work in the wind power sector in Denmark, France and the UK, it explores the extent to which policy learning over the medium term has brought us closer to models that integrate economic, environmental and societal desiderata into renewables policy in a manner congruent with the sustainable development aspirations espoused by the European Union and its constituent states. It contributes to policy theory development by arguing in favour of a new policy paradigm that reaches beyond measures to increase production capacity per se to embrace both the institutional dynamics of innovation processes and the fostering of societal engagement in implementation processes.

DE embodied energy; photovoltaic system; energy payback time
AB In this paper the energy payback time and CO2 emissions of photovoltaic (PV) system have been analyzed. The embodied energy for production of PV module based on single crystal silicon, as well as for the manufacturing of other system components have been computed at macro- and micro-level assuming irradiation of 800-1200 W/m(2) in different climatic zones in India for inclined surface. The energy payback time with and without balance-of-system for open field and rooftop has been evaluated. It is found that the embodied energy at micro-level is significantly higher than embodied energy at macro-level. The effect of insolation, overall efficiency, lifetime of PV system on energy pay back time and CO2 emissions have been studied with and without balance of system. A 1.2kW(p) PV system of SIEMENS for mudhouse at IIT, Delhi based on macro- and micro-level has been evaluated. The CO2 mitigation potential, the importance and role of PV system for sustainable development are also highlighted. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Renewable energy CDM (RE-CDM) projects encourage cost-effective GHG mitigation and enhanced sustainable development opportunities for the host countries. CERs from CDM projects include the value of the former benefits (i.e., "climate change benefits"), whereas the second can be given value through the issuing and trading of tradable green certificates (TGCs). Countries could agree to trade these TGCs, leading to additional revenues for the investors in renewable energy projects and, therefore, further encouraging the deployment of CDM projects, currently facing significant barriers. However, the design of a combination of CDM projects and TGC schemes raises several conflicting issues and leads to trade-offs. This paper analyses these issues, identifies the alternatives that may exist to link TGC schemes with RE-CDM projects and analyses the impacts of those options on different variables and actors.

ID ENERGY; CLASSIFICATION; INFORMATION
AB India being a developing country has witnessed a rapidly growing energy needs owing to fast industrialization. Sustainable and qualitative growth for developing economics and habitat requires increased energy input from various resources while maintaining balance in the ecosystem during exploitation. Paper discusses state of the resource potentials, achievements and various issues related to the power generation in India. The growing concern over environmental degradation caused by fossil fuel based systems, opposition to large hydropower projects on grounds of displacement of land and population, environmental problems with nuclear fuel based systems and the ever-rising shortage of power highlights the need for tapping alternate energy sources for power generation. Amongst the alternate sources utilization of hydropower on a smaller scale (small, mini and micro hydropower) has become the thrust area for sustainable growth in the power sector. Hydropower is an economical and environmentally clean source of renewable energy abundantly available in hilly regions of India. Hydropower stations have an inherent ability for instantaneous starting, stopping, load variations, etc., and help in improving the reliability of power system.
   Huge hydropower potential in India, yet to be explored is located at inaccessible mountainous region. However, development of this potential is challenging due to difficult and inaccessible terrain profile. Paper presents application of remote sensing data for identification and selection of probable site for hydropower projects. The algorithm for identification and assessment of water resources and its perennial is developed in Visual Basic (VB) platform and it is successfully applied for IRS-1D, LISS III Geo-coded False Color Composite (FCC) satellite image for plain as well as hilly and mountainous regions. Classification of satellite image in to different objects is modeled as the task of clustering based on the intensity of R-G-B values of pixels. Results obtained are presented and compared with the Survey of India Toposheets (53K/2, 53K/3 and 53J/16). Use of Remote sensing data provides a scientific method of hydropower identification and assessment. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The reform of the Russian electricity industry represents one of the largest and most technically complex post-Soviet era industrial restructurings. This paper presents the framework, status, and perspectives for the Russian electricity sector liberalisation. Uncertainties regarding the effective implementation of the reform are specifically examined. Ultimately the critical analysis of the reform questions the feasibility and adequacy of the recommended measures in the specific Russian context. Current theories fail to answer a fundamental issue, namely how to promote investment in an obsolete electrical infrastructure and, more generally, whether a pure free market model is compatible with physical constraints posed by the electricity sector. A careless deregulation of the Russian electricity system could hinder the country's stable and sustainable development, as its economy and the population's service have traditionally been closely linked to the electricity industry.

DE ITER; nuclear energy; sustainability
AB Deregulation and new environmental requirements combined with the growing scarcity of fossil resources and the increasing world energy demand lead to a renewal of the debate on tomorrow's energies. Specifically, nuclear energy, which has undeniable assets, faces new constraints. On the one hand, nuclear energy is very competitive and harmless to greenhouse effect. From this point, it seems to be an ideal candidate to reach future objectives of sustainability, availability and acceptability. On the other hand, its technology of production - based on fission - remains imperfect and generates risks for environment and health. In this respect, it is less desirable. Therefore, world researchers turn today towards another type of nuclear technique, fusion, on which the project ITER is founded. This worldwide project is interesting for our analysis because, as a technological revolution, it takes into consideration all the global challenges of nuclear energy for the future, and particularly its capacity to meet the increasing energy needs of developing countries. It is the example par excellence of a successful international scientific collaboration oriented towards very long-run energy ends that involve huge technological, economic and political stakes. Focusing on this project, we thus have to reconsider the future place of nuclear energy in a more and more demanding world.

AB Exergy analysis is important for all energy resource utilization since it is part of energy analysis. In recent years, exergy analysis has been widely used in the design and performance evaluation of thermal systems. In this study, an exergy assessment and modeling of geothermal power plants is presented. A comprehensive case study is conducted in the Kizildere Geothermal Power Plant (KGPP) in Denizli, Turkey. Using the plant data, an evaluation of the KGPP performance, energy and exergy efficiencies, and exergy destructions in each component of the plant as well as in the whole plant are quantified and illustrated using an exergy flow diagram. In addition, a parametric study on the effect of varying reference state properties on the exergy efficiencies of the KGPP is conducted to find the optimum performance and operating conditions.

AB This article seeks to link the domains of corporate governance, investment policies, competitive asymmetries, and sustainable capabilities. Conditions such as concentrated ownership, lengthy tenures, and profound business expertise give some family-controlled business (FCB) owners the discretion, incentive, knowledge, and ultimately, the resources to invest deeply in the future of the firm. These long-term investments accrue from particular governance conditions and engender competitive asymmetries-organizational qualities that are hard for other firms to copy, and thus, if tied to the value chain, create capabilities that are sustainable. Investments in staff and training, e.g., create tacit knowledge and preserve it within the firm. Investments in enduring relationships with partners enhance access to resources and free firms to focus on core competencies. And devotion to a compelling mission dedicates most of these investments to a core competency. When such investments are farsighted, orchestrated, and ongoing, capabilities will tend to evolve in a cumulative trajectory, making them doubly hard to imitate and thereby extending competitive advantage. Arguments are supported by making reference to the literature on corporate governance and agency theory and to emerging research on FCBs.

AB Miscanthus x Giganteus is an excellent candidate for energy cultivation. Here we report, for the first time, the results of the pyrolysis of Miscanthus x Giganteus straw or pellets both in tubular reactor (3-6 g) and in rotary kiln (10-30 g). At 400-600 degrees C the fractions obtained from both reactors are: solid 16-25 (wt.%); liquids 25-40; water 15-20 and gases 15-50. GC-MS analyses of pyrolysis liquids reveal the occurrence of phenolic derivatives and ethanol from lignin, furanic and linear oxygenated compounds from cellulose and hemicellulose. Finally the chars produced by the pyrolysis of M x G pellets in rotary kiln present good calorific values close to 29,000 J/g. Additionally, activated carbons with a BET surface area as high as 800-900 m(2)/g are produced from pellets. These results indicate that chars have a good potential either for energy production, e.g. briquetting, or as adsorbents precursors.

AB The Glasgow Sustainable Urban Drainage System (SUDS) Management Project satisfies the first phase of the Glasgow Surface Water Management Project. This is Glasgow City Council's contribution to the Transformation of Rural and Urban Spatial Structure (TRUST) project, one of the European Union's (EU) interregional (INTERREG IIIB) funded research projects. The remit of this EU project comprises also other representative regions in Europe. The project shows also how SUDS can contribute to the overall catchment dynamics of cities such as Glasgow, ultimately relieving stress on the current predominantly combined sewer system. Fifty-seven sites within 46 areas of Glasgow were identified for investigation. A detailed soil chemistry analysis, a preliminary SUDS feasibility assessment and a desk study relating to historical planning issues that may be relevant for subsequent future development and regeneration options were undertaken. Detailed design and management guidelines were then drafted for selected representative demonstration areas (Belvidere Hospital and Celtic FC Stadium Areas) of high public and property developers interest, and education value. A combination of infiltration trenches or swales with ponds or underground storage were the most likely SUDS options for the majority of the demonstration areas. Soil contamination issues were considered when selecting SUDS because heavy metals such as lead and zinc can cause environmental health problems.

AB Sustainable development requires the management and preservation of water resources indispensable for all human activities. When groundwater constitutes the main water resource, vulnerability maps therefore are an important tool for identifying zones of high pollution risk and taking preventive measures in potential pollution sites. The vulnerability assessment for the Eocene aquifer in the Moroccan basin of Oum Er-Rabia is based on the DRASTIC method that uses seven parameters summarizing climatic, geological, and hydrogeological conditions controlling the seepage of pollutant substances to groundwater. Vulnerability maps were produced by using GIS techniques and applying the "generic" and "agricultural" models according to the DRASTIC charter. Resulting maps revealed that the aquifer is highly vulnerable in the western part of the basin and areas being under high contamination risk are more extensive when the "agricultural" model was applied.

AB The increase in damage due to natural disasters is directly related to the number of people who live and work in hazardous areas and continuously accumulate assets. Therefore, land use planning authorities have to manage effectively the establishment and development of settlements in flood-prone areas in order to avoid the further increase of vulnerable assets. Germany faced major destruction during the flood in August 2002 in the Elbe and Danube catchments, and many changes have been suggested in the existing German water and planning regulations. This article presents some findings of a "Lessons Learned'' study that was carried out in the aftermath of the flood and discusses the following topics: 1) the establishment of comprehensive hazard maps and flood protection concepts, 2) the harmonization of regulations of flood protection at the federal level, 3) the communication of the flood hazard and awareness strategies, and 4) how damage potential can be minimized through measures of area precaution such as resettlement and risk-adapted land use. Although attempts towards a coordinated and harmonized creation of flood hazard maps and concepts have been made, there is still no uniform strategy at all planning levels and for all states (Laender) of the Federal Republic of Germany. The development and communication of possible mitigation strategies for "unthinkable extreme events'' beyond the common safety level of a 100-year flood are needed. In order to establish a sustainable and integrated flood risk management, interdisciplinary and catchment-based approaches are needed.

DE urban parks; environmental practices; water; Mediterranean cities;

ID SUSTAINABILITY; POLITICS
AB In a context of increasing urban sprawl and water scarcity common to other Mediterranean cities, this article focuses on the urban parks in the Region of Barcelona (Catalonia, Spain) to examine how these parks are distributed in this region and to assess whether their design and management follow criteria adapted to Mediterranean environmental conditions, especially in what concerns water use. In order to evaluate the environmental performance of these parks, we selected four factors possibly influencing the adoption of park management practices at the local scale: urban density, population size of the municipality, municipal income per capita, and political orientation of the city council. After determining the location and area of urban parks in the region, we correlated these four explanatory factors with several management tasks extracted from two different samples of parks (one of 315 parks and another of 125 parks) and a survey of 86 city councils. Results show that, in general, urban parks were more frequent in large, dense, and left/green municipalities but that environmentally sound practices were more common in small and low-density municipalities. We conclude that changes in certain practices (especially the substitution of high water demanding species) could improve significantly the environmental performance of public spaces in large urban areas with Mediterranean climates. Our observations may be pertinent for other cities interested in the provision of environmental public goods such as parks that necessitate water for irrigation.

AB In urban ecosystems, the ecological system has become completely unbalanced; this, in turn, has led to an increase in well-known problems such as air pollution, ground pollution, and water pollution. This imbalance has also led to the growth and spread of pathogens harmful to man, animals, and plants. Urban sustainability indicators, both global and local, also "indicate'' the percentage of population, but these refer only to the human population, not the animal population. Cities need good waste, water, and air management, effective traffic planning, and good zoning of businesses, crafts, and services; over and above these activities, cities also need for planning to take into account the existence of pets (dogs, cats, and etc.) and nonpet animals (insects, birds, mice, etc.). Cities tend to be designed around humans and "on a human scale,'' without taking into account the fact that a huge animal population is living side by side with people. That explains why overcrowding tends to go hand in hand with urbanization; all these populations, including humans, need to adapt to new spaces and often need to drastically change their behavior. This is a fact that must be included when drafting sustainable city plans. The supposed strategy is that of "integrated-participatory'' control of the interactions between the environment and animals in the cities. Strategy will focus on the development of integrated approaches and tools for environment and animal management in the context of urban settings. This will require such specific methods as ecological balance sheets and ecoplans for the planning, management, and control of the interrelation among environment, animal, and public health. The objective is to develop a better understanding of urban biodiversity and of urban ecosystem functioning, in order to understand and minimize the negative impacts of human activities on them. The research will focus on assessing and forecasting changes in urban biodiversity, structure, function, and dynamics of urban ecosystems, with relationships among society, economy, biodiversity, and habitats.

AB An assessment of the impact of an illustrative portfolio of policy instruments that address different sustainability concerns in the global energy system in areas of climate change, air pollution and introduction of renewable-energy resources is conducted. The effects of a policy set containing three instruments, implemented either individually or in combination, were examined. The policy instruments under examination in this work include: Cap-and-Trade policies imposing a CO2 emission reduction target on the global energy system, a renewable portfolio standard that forces a minimum share of renewable electricity generation, and the internalisation of external costs of power generation associated with local pollution. Implementation of these policy instruments significantly changes the structure and environmental performance of the energy sector, and particularly the structure of the electric-generation sector. The positive effects are amplified when the policy instruments are simultaneously applied, illustrating the potential for synergies between these energy-policy domains. The analysis has been conducted with the multi-regional, energy-system (G) under bar lobal (M) under bar ARKAL (M) under bar odel (GMM), a "bottom-up" partial-equilibrium model that provides a detailed representation of energy technologies and endogenizes technology learning.

AB Information on solar radiation is a critical issue in several environmental domains. The means for accessing information suffer from severe drawbacks. The SoDa project was launched (2000-2003, IST program of the European Commission) to bring solutions by an efficient use of information and communication technologies. Integration of information sources of different natures was realized by the SoDa Intelligent System. Surveys of users demonstrated that large gains in terms of efficiency, costs, etc. were expected by engineers, companies, agencies and research institutes. The SoDa Service was created in 2003. During the past three years, it has undergone several improvements, including works on the user interface and on the presentation of the services, all aiming at consolidating it with respect to access by users. Promotion efforts were made in the media, including TV. The use of the SoDa Service is increasing from year to year: in 2003, 10,000 requests were satisfied, in 2004, 17,000 requests and 27,000 in 2005. This article presents the lessons learned from the past years and the perspectives of the SoDa Service. We discuss the sustainability of the SoDa Service, the technologies used and the approach to customers, in the perspective of building a 13213 merchant site. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

ID PRECAUTIONARY PRINCIPLE; WASTE; IMPACTS
AB Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) have relevant positive and negative impacts on environmental sustainability on various levels: First-order effects such as increasing electronic waste streams; second-order effects such as improved energy-efficiency of production; third-order effects such as a product-to-service shift in consumption or rebound effects in transport. In the simulation study described in this article, all known relevant effects on all three levels were modeled using a System Dynamics approach in combination with scenario techniques and expert consultations. The prospective study for the European Union with a time-horizon until 2020 revealed great potential for ICT-supported energy management and for a structural change towards a less material-intensive economy, but strong rebound effects in the transport sector whenever ICT applications lead to time or cost savings for transport.

TI Facing South? British environmental movement organisations and the
   challenge of globalisation
SO ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS
LA English
DT Article
AB Environmental movement organisations in Britain have responded differently to globalisation. WWF, Friends of the Earth (FoE) and Greenpeace all have transnational origins, affiliations and aspirations, but whereas WWF and FoE have broadened their agenda to embrace the concerns of the global South with sustainable development and social justice, Greenpeace appears little changed. Explanations are sought in their forms of engagement with other, more powerful actors and with local supporters. Whereas Greenpeace has mainly worked alone on strictly environmental issues, WWF has engaged partners in government and corporations and joined campaign coalitions on global issues. FoE has eschewed corporate partnerships, but has played a leading role in campaign coalitions within and beyond the environmental movement, including the emergent global justice movement. Attentive to the concerns of its local groups and prominent in FoE International, FoE is uniquely exposed to grassroots pressures and influences from the South.

AB Interest in selenium pollution and remediation technology has escalated during the past two decades. Although not known to be essential for plants, selenium is essential but could be toxic for humans and animals, depending on its concentration. A major selenium controversy in the 1980's emerged in California when the general public and scientific community became aware of selenium's potential as an environmental contaminant. After extensive research on several strategies to reduce loads of mobile Se for entering the agricultural ecosystem a plant-based technology, defined as 'phytoremediation' received increasing recognition, as a low-cost environmentally friendly approach for managing soluble Se in the soil and water environment. Successful long-term field remediation of Se by plants is, however, dependent upon acceptance and widespread use by growers, who are also concerned about potential commercial value from using the plant-based technology. Obtaining products with economic value from plants used in the cleanup of soil would certainly be an additional benefit to phytoremediation, which could help sustain its long-term use.

AB Phytoextraction is a promising tool to extract metals from contaminated soils and Brassica napus L. seems to be a possible candidate species for this purpose.
   To select accessions with the ability to accumulate cadmium, hydroponically grown 21 day old seedlings of 77 B. napus L. accessions were exposed to 0.2 mu M CdSO4 for an additional 10 days. The effects of Cd on several parameters were quantified i.e.; shoot Cd concentration ([Cd](shoot)). total amount of Cd in shoots (Total Cd) and the shoot to root Cd concentration ratio (S/R ratio). Though generally natural variation was low for [Cd](shoot), Total Cd and S/R ratio, a number of accessions could be selected. Our results indicated that Total Cd and S/R ratio are independent parameters for Cd accumulation and translocation. The selected varieties were then tested in field experiments on two locations nearby metal smelters. The two locations differed in extractable soil Cd, Zn, Ca concentration and pH levels. On both locations B. napus L. accessions showed significant differences in [Cd](shoot) and Total Cd. Furthermore we found significant correlations between Cd and Zn accumulation in shoots. There were site-specific effects with respect to Cd accumulation in the B. napus L. accessions, however, two accessions seem to perform equally well on both sites. The results of the field experiment suggest that certain B. napus L. accessions are suitable for phytoextraction of moderately heavy metal contaminated soils. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB It has been claimed that good environmental performance can improve firms' economic performance. However, because of e.g. data limitations, the methods applied in most previous quantitative empirical studies on effects of environmental performance on economic performance of firms suffer from several shortcomings. We discuss these shortcomings and conclude that previously applied methods are unsatisfactory as support for a conclusion that it pays for firms to be green. Then we illustrate the consequences of these shortcomings by performing several regression analyses of the effect of environmental performance on economic performance using a panel data set of Norwegian plants. A pooled regression where observable firm characteristics like e.g. size or industry are controlled for, confirms a positive effect of environmental performance on economic performance. However, the estimated positive effect could be due to omitted unobserved variables like management or technology. When the regression model controls for unobserved plant heterogeneity, the effect is generally no longer statistically significant. Hence, although greener plants tend to perform economically better, the analysis provides little support for the claim that it is because they are greener. These empirical findings further indicate that a conclusion that it pays to be green is premature.

AB Following disasters, governments often clamor to quickly reduce risk, rebuild communities and restore permanence. The pressure to urgently address complex, difficult decisions can result in reactive policies that may increase long-term vulnerability of affected populations. Sri Lanka in the aftermath of the 26 December 2004 tsunami represents such an example: a hastily designed coastal buffer zone policy has incited massive relocation of affected populations and resulted in social, economic and environmental problems that threaten the well-being of poor coastal communities. We review the impacts of this policy from its inception, days after the tsunami hit the island, until its revision, approximately 10 months following the disaster. We then apply a framework to conceptualize the components of vulnerability within Sri Lanka's coastal, human-environment system and to identify where post-disaster policies should focus to reduce vulnerability of coastal populations more effectively. From this analysis, it is apparent that the buffer zone policy gave disproportionate attention to reducing exposure to future tsunamis and, subsequently, did not address the critical social, economic and institutional factors that influenced sensitivity to the hazard. Post-disaster policies aimed at sustainable re-development should be informed by an analysis of the components of vulnerability that comprise a system and how these can be most effectively influenced during the separate short-term and long-term phases of rebuilding.

AB Embodied greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and their structure of inducement by the supply-chain networks of 480 goods and services in the United States are analyzed for 44 GHGs. Producing a dollar of a product or service generates an average of 0.36 kg of CO2 equivalent GHGs onsite, increasing to 0.83 kg when supply-chain-induced emissions are taken into account. Services produce less than 5% of total U. S. GHG emissions directly, and their direct GHG emission intensities per dollar output are much less (0.04 kg CO2 equiv/$) than those of physical products, even when supply-chain-induced emissions are included (0.47 kg CO2 equiv/$). When both supply-chain effects and the volume of household expenditures are taken into account, however, household consumption of services excluding electric utilities and transportation services proves to be responsible for 37.6% of total industrial GHG emissions in the United States, almost twice the amount due to household consumption of electric utility and transportation services. Given the current structure of GHG emissions, a shift to a service-oriented economy is shown to entail a decrease in GHG emission intensity per unit GDP but an increase, by necessity, in overall GHG emissions in absolute terms. The results are discussed in the context of U. S. climate change policy.

AB The focus in environmental research is shifting from emission abatement to critical process analysis, including assessment of resource consumption. The exergy theory offers a thermodynamic methodology to account for the consumption of natural resources. However, exergy data on mineral resources available in the literature are inadequate to apply to exergetic life cycle analysis, due to incompleteness, inconsistencies, and a dated thermochemical basis. An uncertainty assessment of the data has to be performed as well. In this work, three recent thermochemical databases were applied to evaluate the chemical exergy of 85 elements and 73 minerals, 21 of which had not yet been quantified in the literature. The process required the choice of a new reference species for aluminum. Muscovite was selected, giving rise to a chemical exergy of 809.4 kJ/mol for aluminum. The theory proved to be robust for the exergy of chemical elements, as exergy values differing by 1.2% on average from most recent literature were found. On the contrary, the exergy values for minerals differed by factors up to 14 from literature values, due to the application of recent thermochemical values and consistently selected reference species. The consistent dataset of this work will enable straightforward resource intake evaluation through an exergetic life cycle assessment.

ID ACID FERMENTATION
AB In this study, the feasibility of waste lime as a potential cation source in phosphate crystallization process was investigated using laboratory scale upflow reactors, adopting sequencing batch type configuration. This research focused on its successful application in a novel sludge treatment process, which is comprised of a high performance fermenter (operating conditions: 55 degrees C and pH 9) followed by a crystallization reactor. In the struvite precipitation test using synthetic wastewater, considerable nutrient removal (about 60%) in the form of ammonia and phosphate was observed within 0.5 - I hr of retention time, and only small amounts (< 5%) of ammonia stripping occurred naturally due to the alkaline (pH 9) characteristic of the feed substrate. By replacing the synthetic wastewater with the fermentation effluent, the optimal dosage of magnesium salt for struvite precipitation was 0.86 g Mg g(-1) P, similar to the mass ratio of the struvite. The optimal dosage of waste lime was 0.3 g l(-1), resulting in 80% of NH4-N and 41% of PO4-P removal, at about 3 hrs of retention time. Microscopic analysis showed that amorphous crystals were mainly observed in the settled solids with waste lime addition whereas prism-like crystals were found in the system with magnesium salt added. Mass balance analysis in full-scale model plants (Q=158,880 m(3)d(-1)) based on the present experimental results revealed that nutrient recycle loading from side stream to main liquid stream would be significantly reduced. The results of the experiment reveal that reuse of industrial waste lime in a nutrient recovery system has the various advantages such as higher economical benefits and sustainable treatment of the industrial waste.

AB This study examined the application of a Self Recovering Sustainable Layer (SRSL) as a landfill final cover. Low-conductivity layers in landfill covers are known to have problems associated with cracking as a result of the differential settlement or climatic changes. A SRSL is defined as a layer with chemical properties that reduces the increased hydraulic conductivity resulting from cracking by forming low-conductivity precipitates of chemicals contained in the layer. In this study, the formation of precipitates was confirmed using a batch test, spectroscopic analysis and mineralogical speciation tests. The possibility of secondary contamination due to the chemicals used for recovery was evaluated using a leaching test. A laboratory conductivity test was performed on a single layer composed of each chemical as well as on a 2-layer system. The recovery performance of the SRSL was estimated by developing artificial cracks in the specimens and observing the change in hydraulic conductivity as a function of time. In the laboratory conductivity test, the hydraulic conductivity of a 2-layer system as well as those of the individual layers that comprise the 2-layer system was estimated. In addition sodium ash was found to enhance the reduction in conductivity. A significant increase in conductivity was observed after the cracks developed but this was reduced with time, which indicated that the SRSL has a proper recovering performance. In conclusion, a SRSL can be used as a landfill final cover that could maintain low-conductivity even after the serious damages due to settlement.

DE global justice; ecological justice; political theory; sustainability
AB 'Global and ecological justice' (or some variant) is a very popular catchphrase in policy documents, treaties, publications by think-tanks, NGOs and other bodies. I argue that it represents an informal combination of four distinct and sometimes conflicting ideas: global justice, protection of the ecology, sustainability and sustainable growth. To solve the practical, conceptual and logical complications thus caused, a more precise interpretation of global justice and ecological justice is suggested, on the basis of which it is also possible to rank the two and re-interpret the further goals of sustainability and growth.

AB Conceptual and methodological changes in ecology have the potential to alter significantly the way we view the world. A result of embracing a dynamic model ('the flux of nature', and 'disturbance regimes') has been to make ecological restoration projects a viable alternative, whereas under 'equilibrium ecology' (climax communities/nature-knows-best) restoration was considered destructive interference. The logic of sustainability strategies within the context of dynamic forces promises a greater compatibility with anthropogenic activity. Unhappily, environmental restoration turns out to be paradoxical under the current identification of wilderness with wildness where wildness is, at least, a necessary condition for the possession of natural value. The solution to the paradox is to separate wilderness from wildness both conceptually and ontologically by enlarging the domain of wildness to include certain human activities.

ID ROTATION
AB In agricultural research conducted in dry areas, crop-yield water use efficiency (WUE) is a measure used to evaluate the impacts of various agronomic factors on crop productivity. Agronomic management factors include supplemental irrigation (SI) and crop-rotation systems, which are used to increase the sustainability of crop production systems. A study of lentil (Lens culinaris Medikus) was conducted in split-plot experiments in randomized complete blocks, where planning date (PD) were assigned to main-plots and SI to sub-plots. Lentil was grown in rotation with durum wheat (i.e., lentil was grown 1 year and durum wheat the next, on the same plot of land) over a period of 4 years (1996/1997-1999/2000) at the research station of the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA), at Tel Hadya, Syria. Spatial variability in the field trials and correlations between the plot errors arising over time were studied to examine their effects on the significance and precision of the estimates of the effects of PD and SI on yields (of both seed and total biomass) and WUE. The analyses revealed the presence of significant linear soil-fertility trends within the fields and strongly autocorrelated plot errors. When these trends were accounted for in the analysis of yield and WUE data, the estimates of the treatment effects had greater levels of significance and precision than when the trends were ignored. It is recommended that in agronomic field trials, such as lentil variety evaluation trials, one should identify the most appropriate spatial and temporal covariance structures and use these to draw statistical inferences about the effects of agronomic input factors.

AB China's Eleventh Five-Year Plan, which sets the directions for national development for the 2006 to 2010 period, has been described as a revolutionary plan. This paper examines the Plan's goal to build a "harmonious socialist society" by enabling disadvantaged groups and less developed regions to share the fruits of economic growth. It first describes the Plan's main principles and major quantitative targets for the five-year period. In the second half of the paper, the author argues that the emphasis on "common prosperity" can be explained by the rise in inequality over more than two decades, by a new political administration that seeks to establish its own path while endorsing ideas from past regimes, and by President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao's more open and consultative style of leadership.

TI The evolution of business-state interaction in Russia: From state
   capture to business capture?
SO EUROPE-ASIA STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
ID INCENTIVES
AB This article discusses two basic strategies of Russian companies - isolation from, and close cooperation with the state. The author analyses several ways in which companies realise these strategies, drawing analogies with the 'exit' and 'voice' strategies suggested by A. Hirschman. It is shown that under the conditions of a weak state these strategies lead either to an expansion of the shadow economy or to 'state capture'. Both the privatisation of the state and the lack of its privatisation result in budget crises as well as drastic social and political shocks, leading to calls for a 'strong hand' in the business community itself. However, as there is little political competition and the mechanisms of democratic control are weak, state consolidation takes place as a bureaucratic consolidation accompanied by new opportunities for informal 'business capture' by the authorities. Nevertheless, the high degree of openness of the economy and the remaining heterogeneity of political actors provide business with a wide range of possible strategies of interaction with the state. This article explores how these strategies are becoming more formal and public compared to the 1990s. Strategies of isolation from the state now take place as legal strategies of internationalisation. Cooperation strategies, on the other hand, currently seem to be more efficient when switching from the traditional lobbying of private interests to more rational and collective actions aimed at providing the necessary conditions for sustainable economic development.

AB Sustainable soil and crop management practices that reduce soil erosion and nitrogen (N) leaching, conserve soil organic matter, and optimize cotton and sorghum yields still remain a challenge. We examined the influence of three tillage practices (no-till, strip till and chisel till), four cover crops {legume [hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth)], nonlegume [rye (Secaele cereale L.)], vetch/rye biculture and winter weeds or no cover crop}, and three N fertilization rates (0, 60-65 and 120-130 kg N ha(-1)) on soil inorganic N content at the 0-30 cm depth and yields and N uptake of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) and sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench]. A field experiment was conducted on Dothan sandy loam (fine-loamy, siliceous, thermic, Plinthic Paleudults) from 1999 to 2002 in Georgia, USA. Nitrogen supplied by cover crops was greater with vetch and vetch/rye biculture than with rye and weeds. Soil inorganic N at the 0-10 and 10-30cm depths increased with increasing N rate and were greater with vetch than with rye and weeds in April 2000 and 2002. Inorganic N at 0-10 cm was also greater with vetch than with rye in no-till, greater with vetch/rye than with rye and weeds in strip till, and greater with vetch than with rye and weeds in chisel till. In 2000, cotton lint yield and N uptake were greater in no-till with rye or 60 kg N ha(-1) than in other treatments, but biomass (stems + leaves) yield and N uptake were greater with vetch L and vetch/rye than with rye or weeds, and greater with 60 and 120 than with 0 kg N ha(-1). In 200 1, sorghum grain yield, biomass yield, and N uptake were greater in strip till and chisel till than in no-till, and greater in vetch and vetch/rye with or without N than in rye and weeds with 0 or 65 kg N ha(-1). In 2002, cotton lint yield and N uptake were greater in chisel till, rye and weeds with 0 or 60 kg N ha(-1) than in other treatments, but biomass N uptake was greater in vetch/rye with 60 kg N ha(-1) than in rye and weeds with 0 or 60 kg N ha(-1). Increased N supplied by hairy vetch or 120-130 kg N ha(-1) increased soil N availability, sorghum grain yield, cotton and sorghum biomass yields, and N uptake but decreased cotton lint yield and lint N uptake compared with rye, weeds or 0 kg N ha(-1). Cotton and sorghum yields and N uptake can be optimized and potentials for soil erosion and N leaching can be reduced by using conservation tillage, such as no-till or strip till, with vetch/rye biculture cover crop and 60-65 kg N ha(-1). The results can be applied in regions where cover crops can be grown in the winter to reduce soil erosion and N leaching and where tillage intensity and N fertilization rates can be minimized to reduce the costs of energy requirement for tillage and N fertilization while optimizing crop production.

AB In southern Benin like in other tropical areas, natural fallows, which were traditionally used in order to improve soil fertility, are no longer possible in a context of high population pressure. Many studies have underlined the advantages of legume cover crops to ensure the sustainability of plant productivity: increase in soil organic matter content, increase in crop yields, improvement of the water regime of soils, and decrease in runoff and erosion. Nevertheless the mechanisms responsible for these modifications are not completely understood. The characterisation of biological activity and diversity in a soil can help in understanding the dynamics of soil structure and the flux of nutrients. For this purpose, the density, diversity and functional composition of soil nematodes and soil macroinvertebrates were measured in different treatments under maize cultivation. The three treatments were: (1) a pure traditional maize crop without any fertilisation (T); (2) a maize crop with a mineral fertiliser (NPK); and (3) a maize crop inter-cropped with Mucuna pruriens var. utifs (M). Soil in plot M presented different biological properties when compared with T and NPK: higher macrofauna density (especially termites, earthworms, millipedes, centipedes) and biomass (especially earthworms and termites), higher density of facultative phytophagous, bacterial-feeding and predatory nematodes, and lower density of obligatory phytophagous (Criconemella, Scutellonema and Meloidogyne) nematodes. The modification of the composition and activity of soil biota under Mucuna might partly explain the potential of Mucuna for soil restoration. (c) 2006 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB The principles underpinning these standards are that any tuberculosis laboratory-based diagnostic procedure should be performed by appropriately trained staff, working to standardised operating procedures in appropriately equipped and safe laboratories, against clear national and international proficiency and quality standards. Quality should be the pre-eminent criteria, not cost.
   The standards are technologically feasible, but initially may not be within the financial capacity of all laboratories. There is a requirement for government and international donors to adequately fund an appropriate safe infrastructure to enable staff to deliver accurate and timely results at whatever level of activity they are performing.
   There is a need for national reference laboratories to train a new cadre of mycobacterial laboratory experts. This will require the funding of appropriate individuals at these centres to train and assist in the implementation of good laboratory practice and evaluation to build sustainable capacity. Further operational research is needed to establish the optimal configuration of new technologies to determine isoniazid, rifampicin and second-line drug susceptibility in mycobacterial cultures and also, increasingly, directly on specimens.
   Improved integration of laboratory medicine as a core part of all tuberculosis programmes is needed to achieve and maximise the potential of new developments.

AB This paper describes the development of an after-school program for middle-school students that simultaneously addressed issues of efficacy and effectiveness in an effort to create an evidence-based intervention (EBI) that can be implemented in school settings. The topics highlighted in this case example are intended to address the growing concern that over-focusing on efficacy in well-controlled, grant-funded studies has resulted in a generation of EBI that are not acceptable, feasible, or sustainable in the majority of applied settings. Our case example focuses on six key issues highlighted in the published research literature: sustainability, recruitment, methodological design, flexibility, training, and meaningful outcomes. We briefly summarize each of these issues and relate them to our experiences conducting a successful pilot study. A summary of the pilot study results is also presented to lend support for the utilization of the EBI model of dissemination described in this paper. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Withdrawal location with progressive tax rates
SO FINANCIAL ANALYSTS JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB Optimal withdrawal strategies are developed for retirees with multiple types of tax-advantaged savings accounts. In an environment of progressive tax rates, the ability to convert pretax funds in traditional IRAs at low tax rates substantially increases investors' residual accumulations and withdrawal sustainability. Specifically, informed withdrawal-location strategies, in which traditional IRA distributions can be applied against exemptions, deductions, and lightly taxed tax brackets, can increase residual accumulations by more than $1 million. In these strategies, the optimal tax bracket through which an investor should take distributions is directly related to the investor's wealth level.

AB The deepwater fishes around the Lihir Island group, Papua New Guinea, were assessed for their vulnerability to exploitation from a potential commercial fishery. Three dropline surveys were made between 1999 and 2002 to estimate catch rates and life-history parameters. Growth parameters were obtained using the von Bertalanffy growth function fitted to length-at-age data from annuli counts in sectioned otoliths. Mean catch rates and total mortality rates were then used to estimate total fish biomass and maximum sustainable yields for the deepwater species around the island group. A total of 975 fish of 98 species were caught during 886 line hours of fishing. Most of these species are commercially valuable: 17 species are commonly fished commercially in other tropical Pacific regions. However around the Lihir Island group, their catch rates (1.38 +/- 0.16 kg/line h) were lower and more variable than elsewhere in the Pacific, probably because of the limited deep-slope habitat. Total deepwater fish biomass between the 125 and 350 m depth zone was estimated at 17.4 metric tonnes with an annual sustainable yield of between 1213 and 3445 kg. In addition, many of the deepwater species may be long-lived, slow-growing species with low mortality rates. Our results suggest that the deepwater fish stock at the Lihir Island group is highly susceptible to overfishing at only moderate levels of fishing pressure. We therefore recommend that a precautionary approach should be taken, including accurate long-term monitoring of catches, if these stocks are to be commercially exploited. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB Tropical shrimp trawling results in large amounts of highly diverse, non-target bycatch. We assessed the incidental catch of seahorses from shrimp trawls in central Vietnam to investigate the effects of fishing on an example group of small fishes that are potentially vulnerable and economically important. We used logbooks and catch landings surveys to quantify seahorse catches from 1996 to 2000. The majority of the seahorse catch consisted of two species, Hippocampus spinosissimus and Hippocampus trimaculatus, whose proportions varied by season and year. We found no consistent, directional patterns across years in key biological and fisheries parameters including seahorse size, sex ratio, reproductive state, life-history stage or catch-per-unit-effort but we had no information on distribution of trawl effort. However, there were strong seasonal patterns in reproductive state and catch-per-unit-effort. Overall, we calculated that the total catch was 36,000-55,000 seahorses year(-1) from a fleet of 150-170 trawlers (a small part of the total Vietnamese fleet), even though the catch was only 0.9-1.6 seahorses boar(-1) night(-1). Other aspects of the trawling process, such as displacement or injury of seahorses, community disruption, and/or habitat damage may still pose a threat to the seahorses, particularly as Vietnam's fisheries intensify.

AB In 2001, paired-trawl comparisons were made during prawn trawl operations to assess the effect of turtle excluder devices and bycatch reduction devices on a range of species groups caught in tropical Australia. This study is one of the first to evaluate the commercial use of these devices in a tropical fishery. Nets with a combination of a turtle excluder device and bycatch reduction device reduced the catches of turtles by 99%, seasnakes by 5%, sharks by 17.7%, rays by 36.3%, large sponges by 85.3%, and small bycatch by 8%, however, these results were largely attributable to the influence of the turtle excluder devices. Nets with both devices also reduced the catch of commercially important prawns by 6%, but the proportion of soft and damaged prawns was reduced by 41%. The combination of these devices had no measurable impact on catches of any of the three byproduct species groups: Thenus spp. (Moreton Bay bugs), Teuthoidea spp. (squid) and Amusium pleuronectes (scallops). Turtles excluder devices reduced the numbers of larger sharks and rays (> 1 m) by 86% and 94%, respectively. They did not reduce the total number of sawfish caught, but did reduce the number of the most commonly caught species - the narrow sawfish (Anoxypristis cuspidata) - by 73.3%. Upward- and downward-excluding turtle excluder devices performed about equally for most species groups, although upward excluders were more effective for sharks and less effective for large sponges. The performance of BRDs was poor for most groups and could be improved by using them in more effective positions such as closer to the codend catch. The use of these devices is a major step towards ensuring the long-term conservation of many species, especially endangered sea turtles and vulnerable elasmobranchs. As fishers become more experienced in their use, we are optimistic that the fishery's impact on bycatch will reduce even further. Crown Copyright (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB We used time series of biomass and catches for the major commercial groundfish stocks in the Eastern Bering Sea/Aleutian Islands region and in the Gulf of Alaska to compute annual surplus production for 1977-2004. Annual surplus production and average annual biomass were aggregated across stocks within each region to examine the relationship between total surplus production and total aggregated biomass. We fit two surplus production models (Graham-Schaefer and Pella-Tomlinson) to the observed relationships to estimate maximum multi-species surplus production (equivalent to maximum sustainable yield) of the groundfish complexes in these ecosystems. Maximum multi-species surplus production was estimated to be approximately 2.5 x 10(6) t in the Bering Sea/Aleutian Islands and 330 x 10(3) t in the Gulf of Alaska. These point estimates were smaller than the sum of single-species MSY proxies from recent stock assessments, and estimates for the Gulf of Alaska were much smaller than earlier estimates that were used to specify optimum yield ranges for the Gulf of Alaska groundfish complex. Therefore, optimum yield ranges for the Gulf of Alaska may need to be re-assessed to reflect more recent conditions.
   We further estimated the effects of environmental variability on annual surplus production using correlations and generalized surplus production models with environmental covariates. Results suggest that surplus production in the Bering Sea may be lower during conditions associated with the positive phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, which is characterized by warmer temperatures, reduced ice, and reduced wind mixing over the shelf. Similarly, surplus production on the Gulf of Alaska shelf was lower during years with warm bottom temperatures coupled with low salinities in late winter. If maximum multi-species surplus production varies as a result of environmental variability, optimum yield ranges for the groundfish complexes in these ecosystems should take such fluctuations into account.

AB In this paper, we demonstrate an objective and quantitative methodology for developing a stand scale index of structural complexity. While we use data from particular woodland and dry sclerophyll forests communities in south-eastern Australia to do this, our methodology has generic value. Our approach involves: (1) establishing a comprehensive suite of stand structural attributes; (2) quantifying attributes in the comprehensive suite, by collecting data from a set of stands representing the range of condition occurring in the vegetation communities in which the index is intended to operate; (3) identifying a core set of structural attributes from an analysis of these data; and (4) combining the core attributes in a simple additive index, in which attributes are scored relative to their observed levels in each vegetation community. To apply this approach, data were collected from 48 study sites representing the range of condition in a 15,000 km(2) study area located in the South-eastern Highlands Bioregion of Australia. The following 13 core attributes were identified from these data: vegetation cover < 0.5 m; vegetation cover 0.5-6.0 m; perennial species richness; lifeform richness; stand basal area of live trees; quadratic mean diameter of live stems; In(number of regenerating stems ha(-1) + 1); ln(number of hollow-bearing trees ha(-1) + 1); root(number of dead trees ha(-1) + 1); root(number of live stems ha(-1) > 40 cm dbh); root(total log length ha(-1)); root(total large log length ha(-1)); and litter dry weight ha(-1). These core attributes were combined in a simple additive index, in which, each attribute accounted for 10 points in a total index value of 130. Attributes were rescaled as a score from 0 to 10, using equations that modelled attribute score as a function of the raw attribute data (r(2) > 0.95, p < 0.0001). The index was not sensitive to attribute weightings and, on this basis, attributes carried equal weight. In this form, the index was straightforward to apply, and differentiated between study sites.

AB Forestry based carbon emissions offset projects have potential to both mitigate climate change and foster sustainable forest management. Degraded African tropical forests could sequester large amounts of additional carbon, but the lack of empirical data limits the feasibility of initiating carbon offset projects in many threatened forests. This study examines the potential to increase carbon stocks in the Kakamega National Forest of western Kenya, a threatened biodiversity hotspot and Kenya's only remaining rainforest. Carbon density values for indigenous forest and plantations were estimated based on forest inventory data from 95 randomized plots distributed throughout the forest. Total ecosystem carbon was estimated using allometric, equations for tree biomass, destructive techniques for litter and herbaceous vegetation biomass, and Dumas combustion and spectroscopy for soils. Land cover maps for 1975, 1986, and 2000 were used to estimate both current carbon stocks and the influence of past land use changes. Mean carbon density in indigenous forest was 330 +/- 65 Mg C/ha, greater than that of the forest's hardwood plantations (280 +/- 77 Mg C/ha) and significantly greater that that of softwood plantations (250 +/- 77 Mg C/ha). The distribution of carbon densities within the indigenous forest and the variation between plantation types suggest management practices could feasibly increase Kakamega's carbon stock. Deforestation between 1975 and 1986 and limited reforestation from 1986 to 2000 have resulted in a net loss of 0.4-0.6 Tg C. If this loss were reversed, the value of possible associated carbon credits dwarfs the current operational budget for managing and protecting the forest, even at low carbon prices. Additional income could help address resource needs of impoverished communities surrounding the forest and promote sustainable protection of Kakamega's high biodiversity. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB In the northern hardwood region of North America managing for late-successional forest habitats and functions is an important element of ecosystem management. This study tests the hypothesis that uneven-aged practices can be modified to accelerate rates of late-successional forest development. An approach, termed "structural complexity enhancement" (SCE), is compared against conventional uneven-aged systems modified to increase post-harvest structural retention. Experimental treatments, including controls, were applied to 2 ha units and replicated at two multi-aged northern hardwood forests in Vermont, USA.
   Structural objectives include vertically differentiated canopies, elevated large snag and downed log densities, variable horizontal density (including small gaps), and re-allocation of basal area to larger diameter classes. The latter objective is achieved, in part, by cutting to a rotated sigmoid diameter distribution. This is generated from a basal area (34 m(2) ha(-1)) and tree size (90 cm dbh) indicative of old-growth structure. Forest structure data have been collected over 2 years pre-treatment and 3 years post-treatment. Fifty-year simulations of stand development were run in NE-TWIGS and FVS comparing treatment and no treatment scenarios. Simulations also tested the sensitivity of large tree development to prescription parameters. Leaf area index retention was spatially variable but significantly (P < 0.001) greater under SCE (91%) compared to conventional treatments (75%). Post-harvest aboveground biomass (P = 0.041), total basal area (P = 0.010), and stem density (P = 0.025) were significantly different among treatments, with SCE generally retaining more structure than conventional treatments. SCE increased coarse woody debris volumes by 140%; there was a 30% increase under conventional treatments. SCE successfully achieved the rotated sigmoid diameter distributions, and sustained these 50 years into the future, resulting in reallocated basal area. Cumulative basal area increments are projected to increase by 3.7 and 5.0 m(2) ha(-1) compared to no treatment scenarios for SCE and conventional treatments, respectively. Basal areas will be significantly (P = 0.025) greater after 50 years in SCE units due to higher residual basal areas. Conventional treatments are projected to produce 10 fewer large trees per hectare (> 50 cm dbh) than would have developed without treatment, whereas SCE is likely to recruit five more large trees per hectare than the no treatment scenario. Large tree recruitment rates were related primarily to the form of residual diameter distributions (P = 0.006) and, possibly, to maximum diameter limits. Late-successional characteristics in northem-hardwood systems can be promoted through a variety of modified uneven-aged silvicultural approaches based on the results. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB Participatory forest management (PFM) in Bangladesh has become the dominant strategy in the country's forestry sector. The main goal of PFM is to enhance the capacity of both state and civil society stakeholders to manage forests in a sustainable manner. This study aims to evaluate capacity development for key stakeholders using '4Rs' stakeholder analysis. The data for this study were collected through focus group discussions with local stakeholders, individual interviews with forest department (FD) staff and a sample survey of participating farmers. Information derived from focus group and individual interviews were analysed using conceptual content analysis and sample survey data were analysed using statistical analysis. Conceptual content analysis suggested the following: among stakeholders, the national government, concerned civil servants, concerned FD staff and the funding agency are the most important and influential stakeholders; although local FD staff and participating farmers are important and are the most experienced stakeholders, they cannot participate in the decision-making process and thus are less influential as stakeholders. The FD usually has ownership and revenue collection rights over a PFM project, while participating farmers have only usufruct rights over the forest resources and are responsible for protecting and managing the participatory managed forests, so that those stakeholders with many responsibilities and rights benefit less. Relationships between the project implementers and the local stakeholders are poor. Statistical analysis suggests that in respect to participating farmers: about 46% did not received any benefits from the forests; about 30% who received benefits were not satisfied with what they received; about 85% did not attend any decision-making process; about 19% did not agree with the strategy of PFM; and about 28% were unable to participate in PFM with their acquired capacity. Overall analyses suggest that the capacity of stakeholders for sustainable PFM did not develop to the level anticipated under the project proposal. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Goals for public participation implied by sustainable development, and
   the preparatory process of the Finnish National Forest Programme
SO FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
DE participation goals; public participation; National Forest Programme;
   sustainable development; legitimation
AB Since the UNCED in 1992, National Forest Programmes (NFP) have been widely acknowledged as a means to implement internationally agreed upon sustainability goals for forest management. However, national forest programmes are prepared and implemented in national political, social and ecological contexts, which vary significantly between countries. Finland has a long tradition of "forest programming", starting from the 1950s, which has contributed to the institutions and culture of preparing such programmes. These programmes have traditionally been prepared in governmentally facilitated committees and working groups in close collaboration with interest groups and representatives of research and administration.
   In this paper, we develop goals for participation in a policy decision-making process. These goals, based on sustainable development definitions and policies, include: (1) generating new relevant information, (2) incorporating all relevant interests and (3) contributing to reaching public agreement.
   Demands for increasing public awareness, inclusion of different views as well as respect for procedural citizen rights were obvious expectations also behind Finland's National Forest Programme 2010 that was made in 1999. The new forms of participation applied in the already well-developed interest-group-integrating policy preparation system provided an opportunity to take the participation goals more seriously. According to our analysis, the arguments arising from the new forms of participation were strongly in line with those already previously present in Finnish forest policy discourse, and the new forms of participation functioned merely as legitimating and awareness raising systems.

AB The restoration of New Orleans and the rest of the Mississippi delta after Hurricane Katrina can become another disaster waiting to happen, or it can become a model of sustainable development. Sea level is rising, precipitation patterns are changing, hurricane intensity is increasing, energy costs are predicted to soar, and the city is continuing to sink. Most of New Orleans is currently from 0.6 to 5 m (2-15 feet) below sea level. The conventional approach of simply rebuilding the levees and the city behind them will only delay the inevitable. If New Orleans, and the delta in which it is located, can develop and pursue a new paradigm, it could be a truly unique, sustainable, and desirable city, and an inspiration to people around the world. This paper discusses the underlying causes and implications of the Katrina disaster, basic goals for a sustainable redevelopment initiative, and seven principles necessary for a sustainable vision for the future of New Orleans and the Mississippi delta.

ID CONDUCTORS; PROJECT
AB Superconductors carrying currents larger than several 10 kA are required for magnetic confinement fusion systems. A cable-in-conduit-conductor (CICC), which has about 1000 of twisted thin superconducting strands in a ridged conduit, is a promising candidate for such large and high magnetic field superconducting system. A specific phenomenon in the CICC is so called avalanche-like quench (AQ).
   When some strands become resistive due to current saturation at critical current and/or a mechanical disturbance, the current re-distributes from the strands into neighboring ones, which are electro-magnetically coupled more strongly than the others. This causes current saturation in the neighboring strands. Finally, the whole cable becomes normal. We call this phenomenon an avalanche-like quench.
   Small multi-strand cables were tested by induced-current methods. Quench behaviors of both Nb3Sn and NbTi cables are observed and compared. In the experiment, for the Nb3Sn cable, the critical current measurement was stably carried out at high field without quench. In contrast, for the NbTi cable, we observed a number of AQs during inductive energization. Consequently, we suspected that the reason is based on the difference of critical temperature (T-C) between Nb3Sn and NbTi. The difference of TC is several Kelvins, however, their macroscopic behaviors differ significantly. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Past and future of backcasting: The shift to stakeholder participation
   and a proposal for a methodological framework
SO FUTURES
LA English
DT Article
ID SUSTAINABILITY
AB This paper deals with the past, present and future of backcasting. After having reviewed the origin and developments since the 1970s, it is concluded that several varieties can be distinguished and that a shift has been made to broad stakeholder participation and towards a focus on realising follow-up and implementation. A methodological framework for participatory backcasting is proposed consisting of five stages and four groups of tools and methods that can be applied and are necessary in such a framework, while different type of goals are possible. The paper reports on two cases in which participatory backcasting was applied, the Novel Protein Foods project at the Sustainable Technology Programme in the Netherlands and the Nutrition case study of the Sustainable Households (SusHouse) project. The paper concludes that these have resulted in broad stakeholder involvement, sustainable future visions, analyses and construction of follow-up agendas, but that follow-up and impacts are quite different. A research agenda is proposed to compare and evaluate backcasting studies and their impacts after a couple of years, while the future of participatory backcasting is also briefly discussed.

ID LAKE PATZCUARO BASIN; MEXICO; MICHOACAN; QUALITY
AB The soil classification system developed by a Purhepecha community in central Mexico was formalized, incorporating symbolic, cognitive and practical components. The soil is recognized by farmers as a three-dimensional living body, composed of earth material, air and fluids, organic matter, and living organisms including plants and animals, and organized in layers. The indigenous soil taxonomy is hierarchical, with four categorical levels, and soil classification is flexible enough to adapt to a changing social and environmental context. The local soil map units were compared to those provided by a technical soil classification of general scope (USDA soil taxonomy), using spatial analysis within a GIS environment to determine levels of cartographic correlation. The average spatial correlation at high taxonomic level, computed taking into account only the dominant soils in each map unit, is 74% for the technical-local comparison and 75% for local-technical comparison. At low taxonomic level, the average spatial correlation based on dominant soils only is 62% for the technical-local comparison and 61% for the local-technical comparison. The variable levels of spatial correlation between technical and local soil map units reflect differences in the ways both systems classify soils. However, similarities and discrepancies between making technical and local soil maps reveal complementarities. Critical is the evaluation of topsoil characteristics, as the understanding and monitoring of topsoil dynamics are fundamental for land use decision-making by farmers. Spatial correlation analysis of topsoil properties provides a good basis for collaboration between farmers and soil surveyors. Merging technical and local thinking is indispensable to formulate sustainable land management schemes. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The increasing attention paid to local soil knowledge results from a greater recognition that farmer knowledge can offer many insights into the sustainable management of tropical soils and that the integration of local and technical knowledge systems helps extension workers and scientists work more closely with farmers. A participatory approach and a methodological guide were developed to identify and classify local indicators of soil quality and relate them to technical soil parameters, and thus develop a common language between farmers, extension workers and scientists. This methodological guide was initially developed and used in Latin America and the Caribbean-LAC (Honduras, Nicaragua, Colombia, Peru, Venezuela, Dominican Republic), and was later improved during adaptation and use in eastern African (Uganda, Tanzania, Kenya, Ethiopia) through a South-South exchange of expertise and experiences. The aim of the methodological guide is to constitute an initial step in the empowerment of local communities to develop a local soil quality monitoring and decision-making system for better management of soil resources. This approach uses consensus building to develop practical solutions to soil management constraints identified, as well as to monitor the impact of management strategies implemented to address these constraints. The particular focus on local and technical indicators of agroecosystem change is useful for providing farmers with early warnings about unobservable changes in soil properties before they lead to more serious and visible forms of soil degradation. The methodological approach presented here constitutes one tool to incorporate local demands and perceptions of soil management constraints as an essential input to relevant research for development activities. The participatory process followed was effective in facilitating fanner consensus; for example, about which soil related constraints were most important and what potential soil management options could be used. Development of local capacities for consensus building constitute a critical step prior to collective action by fanning communities resulting in the adoption of integrated soil fertility management strategies at the farm and landscape scale.

AB This paper examines the nature of environmental action in and around the home. Given the rise of local sustainable development and the emphasis placed on individual actions for sustainability, the paper examines the role of citizens in adopting sustainable lifestyles, incorporating a range of behavioural responses from energy saving and water conservation, to waste recycling and green consumption. Focussing on the debate in geography concerning the engagement of the public in environmental action, the paper argues that despite the assertions of those who advocate a deliberative approach to engagement (see [Owens, S., 2000. Engaging the public: information and deliberation in environmental policy. Environment and Planning A 32,1141-1148]), an approach based on a social-psychological understanding of behaviour can have significant benefits. Such an approach is being developed by geographers in a range of settings and in this paper these developments are situated within the context of existing research that has identified environmental 'activists' in terms of their values, attitudes and demographic composition. The paper aims to examine environmental behaviour in relation to two key issues: (1) the way in which environmental action is framed in everyday practices (such as consumption behaviour) and (2) how these practices are reflected amongst different segments of the population to form lifestyle groups. The paper provides new insights for examining sustainable lifestyles that further our appreciation of how actions to help the environment are lived in everyday practices and framed by different lifestyle groups. Accordingly, the paper offers both academics and policy makers new insights into the potential use of focussing on lifestyle groups as a means for changing behaviour. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper focuses on sustainability appraisal as a key technique for pursuing the political goal of 'sustainable development' within English planning. We conclude that unlike many planning tools of the past which have sought to depoliticise decision making by using more 'scientific' techniques, the early experience of sustainability appraisal has instead repoliticised them, by highlighting where tensions exist but without providing solutions.

AB South Africa is unique in that its globally significant biodiversity, which is under significant threat, coexists with an apartheid history of dispossession that produced a starkly unequal land ownership pattern and widespread rural poverty. It is in this context that the postapartheid government must fulfil constitutional and international obligations to safeguard environmental assets as well as undertake land reform benefiting the previously dispossessed. Consequently, there is a continuous challenge of reconciling complex and often conflicting relationships between poverty, inequitable access to resources, and the protection of biodiversity. Current efforts to conserve the Cape Floral Kingdom emphasize partnerships between private landowners and existing nature reserves to promote sustainable utilisation of biodiversity. This paper presents a case study exploring how this approach might be reconciled with land rights and opportunities for land-based livelihoods among farm dwellers in the Baviaanskloof area of the Eastern Cape. The paper identifies systemic and structural tensions in current attempts to reconcile biodiversity conservation and farm dwellers' interests, and documents issues of process and principle that could become important in the future. In doing so, it highlights the influence of on-farm power relations and overly complex institutional arrangements in determining the real extent of participation by affected farm dwellers and the efficacy of social safeguard policies. Findings also caution against an over-reliance on ecotourism as the major occupation and the paper argues instead for support for multiple livelihood strategies. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Good health status is one of the primary aspirations of human social development and, as a consequence, health indicators are key components of the human development indices by which we measure progress toward sustainable development. Certain diseases and ill health are associated with particular environmental and climate conditions. The timeframe of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) demands that the risks to health associated with current climate variability are more fully understood and acted upon to improve the focus of resources in climate sensitive disease control, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, where good epidemiological surveillance data are lacking. In the absence of high-quality epidemiological data on malaria distribution in Africa, climate information has long been used to develop malaria risk maps illustrating the climatic suitability boundaries for endemic transmission. However, experience to data has shown that it is difficult in terms of availability, timing and cost to obtain meteorological observations from national meteorological services in Africa. National health services generally find the costs of purchasing these data prohibitive given their competing demands for resources across the spectrum of health service requirements. Some national health services have tried to overcome this access problem by using proxies derived from satellites, which discusses the issues related to climate and health, reviews the current use of climate information for malaria endemic and epidemic surveillance, and presents examples of operational use of climate information for malaria control in Africa based on Geographical information Systems and Remote Sensing.

AB The new argumentative and communicative approach to environmental planning is replacing the traditional approach of planning derived from cybernetic models and based on the linear control of systems' dynamics. The traditional absolute monologic rationality of planning is today challenged by more complex, multilogic, multivalue and weak rationality, explicitly contextualized to different social and physical environments. Not achieving targets, but rather building discourses and visions related to evolving situations are the new grounds of planning processes, where different stakeholders can intentionally locate behaviours, meanwhile learning about themselves and their realities.
   In this context, traditional cybernetic planning seem unable to face the probabilistic and chaotic environmental phenomena, so making it extremely hard to point out elements, to schedule times, to respect consistencies. However, practical cases of experimentation of the argumentative approach to environmental planning are particularly rare.
   Given this starting conceptual condition, the present paper will try to contribute to the research field, dealing with the potentials using an ICT-based argumentative and communicative approach to environmental planning. In particular, a proposed process will be discussed, with reference to Future studies and to the Strategic choice approach, hybridized by information technologies.
   The context of such experimentation is a 5-year EU-financed project to build sustainable development futures in the Mediterranean region, ended in 2003.

AB The aim of our study was to identify the clinical and echocardiographic predictors of long-term success of cardioversion in patients with persistent atrial fibrillation (AF). Our study comprised 104 patients (F/M 33/71; mean age 60.4 +/- 7.9 years) assigned to SR restoration and maintenance with sequentially administered antiarrhythmic drugs. Their clinical and transthoracic echocardiographic (TTE) variables were recorded prior to cardioversion and examined for correlation with sinus rhythm (SR) maintenance at 1 year. The variables under consideration included age, gender, echo parameters such as long and short left atrial (LA) axis, LA and right atrial (RA) area, fractional shortening (FS) and left ventricular end-diastolic diameter, AF duration, New York Heart Association functional class, and concomitant diseases. Generalized additive logistic regression method was used to investigate impact of the selected variables on long-term SR maintenance. At 1 year, SR was present in 63.5% of patients. Left atrium area (LA(ar)) > 28cm (P < 0.02) and FS value > 26% (P < 0.05), both measured at baseline, were significantly associated with SR maintenance after 1 year. Patients with large LA(ar) values (> 28cm(2)) presented a significant decrease (31.45 +/- 3.07cm(2) vs 28.94 +/- 3.81cm(2); P < 0.008) during 30 days following SR maintenance. In patients with LA(ar) > 28cm(2) we noted an atrial decrease of 2.57 +/- 3.2cm(2) (P < 0.004) during 30 days following SR restoration, which turned out to be an independent factor related to SR presence at 1 year of follow-up (relative risk 1.83; 95% confidence interval: 1.03-2.95; P < 0.01). Of all the considered variables only LA area and FS value seem to be relatively reliable predictors of SR sustainability at 1 year after an effective cardioversion of persistent AF.

AB Two issues arise in the long-term use of groundwater for thermal purposes: (1) the sustainability of an individual system; and (2) the effect of neighbouring systems on each other. Both of these effects are observed in an area of the Carbonate Rock Aquifer beneath Winnipeg in Manitoba, Canada, where groundwater has been exploited in thermal applications since 1965. In this area, there are four systems that utilize groundwater for cooling purposes that are closely spaced. The current temperatures observed in this area of the Carbonate Rock Aquifer and the results of the numerical modeling conducted in this study confirm that in each system, temperatures at the production well have risen as a result of breakthrough of injected water. The results of numerical modeling also indicate that interference effects are present in three of the four systems examined in this study. The influence of these systems on each other implies that these systems have a spacing that is smaller than the optimum spacing for such systems, and indicates that there is a limit to the density of development that can occur in a given aquifer.

AB Trifa is the most productive agricultural plain of north-eastern Morocco. The development of agricultural activities during the last few decades has been mainly based on imported water for irrigation. However, irrigation requirements have become so large that groundwater is used as a secondary source to supply the agricultural and domestic water needs, causing a depletion of the groundwater resources, especially during dry periods. A hydrological and a hydrogeological model for the Trifa plain have been developed, which yield information on relevant parameters such as groundwater recharge, and estimate the amount of pumped groundwater needed to meet the irrigation needs. The models (MODFLOW and WetSpass) provide insight into the status and evolution of the groundwater reserves. The results of the study are useful to predict the sustainability of the groundwater resources in the Trifa plain and to evaluate possible management actions. A reduction in groundwater abstraction by at least 25% may be necessary to achieve sustainable conditions.

TI An approximate projection of availability of the fresh groundwater
   resources in the South West district of NCT Delhi, India: a case study
SO HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB The future availability and sustainability of fresh groundwater resources in the South West district of the national capital territory (NCT) Delhi, India, have been projected. Due to a rapid decline in groundwater level and quality, the district has been required by the Government of India to regulate development of groundwater resources. Shallow groundwater is mostly saline and water resources in the area are limited. The methodology applied here involves microzonation of the district in terms of thickness of fresh groundwater and then quantification of present and future availability of freshwater in different freshwater zones, including tentative timescales. The calculation method has been aided by data on historic trends in water level at representative groundwater monitoring stations, located either in fresh groundwater zones or near to them. It is estimated that the presently available 481 million m(3) of resources will be reduced to 374 million m(3) by year 2007 and to 303 million m(3) by the year 2012, and by 3 the year 2022 the district will have only 176 million m of available fresh groundwater resources.

AB The use of chemical compounds of vegetable origin in industrial production shows several environmentally beneficial effects (renewability, biodegradability, low toxicity, no impact on CO2 level) over synthetic products presently being widely used.
   In this paper, some pre-industrial studies on the potential of substituting in two Tuscan industrial districts some mineral lubricants (mainly alkylbenzene) widely used in textile (spinning phase of wool) and tannery (both in dry and damp phase) processing with formulations based on High Oleic Sunflower Oil (HOSO) will be discussed. This research was carried out by private companies that depend on seed production (farmers and their main associations, Seed Company), oil extraction, refining, and formulation. The new, low environmental impact formulations were tested at an industrial level to verify their application potential from technical, environmental, and economical viewpoints.
   The results confirmed that HOSO could substitute mineral oils in textile and tannery applications without any technical problem and without any facility modifications. In some cases such as crust leather production, the HOSO-based lubricant (BIOVIT) improved the softness of the finished product. The environmental impact evaluation carried out by the Eurostat framework of environmental pressure indicators confirmed how a higher sustainability could be obtained by the utilisation of new oils characterised by a higher biodegradability. Finally, the economic analysis showed a higher production cost and price of vegetable oils, but, at the same time, indicated the possibility of reducing the required amount due to a lower utilisation rate. Anyway, the price difference between the mineral and vegetable-based oils has to be limited to arrive at a commercial application. Based on these results, HOSO could represent an efficient alternative to mineral oils and so new commercial lubricant called BIOVIT based on HOSO began to be commercialised both for textile and tannery industries.

AB This paper describes a model which has been developed to direct and generate productivity improvement in a group of manufacturing companies. The companies are of all sizes including Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and form a cross-section of industries and abilities with regard to manufacturing. There is a wide range of manufacturing efficiency improvement methods available to the companies, such as Just in Time (JIT), or a range of lean manufacturing tools. The selection of appropriate tools for manufacturing improvement, together with their applicability, incorporation and acceptance within operations is a major problem for many companies. A methodology has therefore been developed which consists of three clearly defined steps, starting with a Productivity Needs Analysis (PNA), which gives an overview of the current manufacturing condition of the company, identifies the key productivity measures for the plant and forms the basis for a detailed study of production efficiency. The plant processes and problems are defined and are associated with the appropriate tools and metrics in a Manufacturing Needs Analysis (MNA), which generates an initial 1-year improvement plan for a particular manufacturing unit. The output from the procedure is obtained as a numerical ranking. In order to ensure that the tools which are found to be efficacious are fully embedded within the company, the PNA and MNA are combined with a Training Needs Analysis (TNA). The paper describes the approach and the results obtained from 15 companies plus an identified exemplar, Nissan Motor Manufacturing UK Ltd. (NMUK). (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper provides an overview of biomass production potentials, and the importance of technological development and perennial crops to utilize this potential. It examines some of the most critical issues for developing large-scale biomass for energy production, and indicates at the same time how these issues may be avoided or solved. An overview is provided of on-going developments to ensure the 'greenness' of biomass by developing safeguards, e.g. via sustainability criteria and certification schemes for bioenergy. Finally, the importance of sustainable international bioenergy trade as a major driver to develop biomass potentials is highlighted.

ID ASSET BUBBLES; WAGE
AB This paper analyzes the growth and employment effects of dynamic fiscal policies in an overlapping generations model with endogenous growth and imperfect labour markets. With balanced-budget policies, the modelled closed economy grows at a constant rate which is higher, the lower are the labour tax rate and the unemployment rate. Constant-flow budget policies are not feasible, while government Ponzi games are feasible only if economic agents have implausibly high savings rates. Furthermore, while constant-stock fiscal policies are sustainable, an increase in the debt-to-capital ratio is accompanied by higher taxes, a rise in unemployment and lower economic growth.

   SCALE
AB Assessing public utilities, such as urban water systems, can be extremely complicated because of the difficulties in quantifying system attributes. A framework for developing and aggregating performance indicators can assist the measurement and assessment process. In this article, research involving an integrated set of performance indicators applied to the urban water system of Tehran, Iran, is discussed. Specifically, a fuzzy inference model was used to aggregate indicators into an overall system-performance index, which can be used to make comparisons among a large number of competing water system alternatives. The approach proposed in this article can also be applied to the assessment of other urban public utilities.

TI No compromise - The integration of technology and aesthetics (Solar
   technology)
SO JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTURAL EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Solar technology is burdened with a stigma that contradicts a sense of proportion and beauty in building. Arbitrarily attached to new or existing construction, the technology is often associated with a small clique of individuals disenfranchised from the mainstream. This project is designed to challenge these perceptions and reestablish the ideals of solar energy by integrating architecture and technology. It pushes existing paradigms by proposing architectural form that celebrates solar power while obtaining a high level of system integration. As each technical decision was measured against its contribution to spatial effect, the project attained a simultaneous sense of the sustainable and the beautiful.

AB Pediatric asthma programs have struggled to integrate children's medical and social needs. We developed and piloted an integrated team model for asthma care for low-income children through the Yes We Can Urban Asthma Partnership. Program evaluation demonstrated increases in prescribing controller medications (p < 0.05), use of action plans (p < 0.001), and the use of mattress covers (p < 0.001); and decrease in asthma symptoms (p < 0.01). Additional changes occurred within the local system of asthma care to support ongoing efforts to improve asthma management. We conclude that pediatric asthma programs can effectively target the social and medical needs of children in a sustainable manner.

AB Stigma has been identified as a major barrier to health care and quality of life in illness management. But unfortunately there is no common theoretical perspective on stigma. We need a sustainable theory of health-related stigma. This would start with a coherent definition of stigma that brings together both individual and social dimensions of this complex phenomenon. It would reassesses the existence of 'types' of stigma and explain how stigma relates to disadvantage. A sustainable theory would help researchers to move from theory into practice: to develop a comprehensive measurement tool for stigma and related disadvantage, and inform design, monitoring and evaluation of anti-stigma interventions. This paper draws on two recent literature reviews on HIV/AIDS stigma to introduce several key issues in developing a sustainable theory of stigma. We suggest limiting the definition of stigma to the process of othering, blaming and shaming (often called symbolic stigma). We argue that there is value in analytically separating stigma from discrimination in order to better understand the relationship between them. We also suggest the need to understand discrimination caused by stigma as only one element of stigma-related disadvantage. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

DE sustainable development; steel construction
AB This paper discusses the importance of construction to the three elements of sustainable development, namely economic growth, social progress and effective protection of the environment. The paper goes on to identify the issues facing construction in meeting the sustainable development agenda; these include efficient use of natural resources, reducing energy consumption, reducing emissions, minimizing waste, more efficient land use, reducing the impact on construction sites and creating better employment conditions. The ways in which steel construction is addressing these issues are discussed. In the context of new buildings, steel's impact on the construction process-namely speed, prefabrication, safety, waste minimization and factory and site conditions are described. Ways in which construction form can contribute to reducing the energy consumption in buildings, particularly during the "in-use" part of the building's lifecycle, are outlined. The role of steel in extending the life of existing building stock is examined and design features for enabling re-use of steel components are highlighted. The paper concludes with remarks on the extent to which constructional steel is recovered and recycled at the end of life of buildings. (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier Ltd

AB In recent years increased interest in sustainable forest management initiatives has encouraged the development of market-based certification schemes, each with a different political economy. This paper examines the emergence of certification practices within four resource periphery contexts (Malaysia, Indonesia, Australia and New Zealand). Seen from the context of resource peripheries, certification is part of an emerging regime of production-consumption relationships, where political barriers to trade, production and investment are complemented by technical practices purportedly designed to codify wood and fibre quality. This paper argues that forest certification and ensuring standards represent a new basis of value creation and competition.

AB In August 2000, a survey of public opinion was carried out among visitors, local residents and representatives of local self-governments in the territory of the Podyji/Thaya River Basin National Park in the Czech Republic. The goal was to obtain stakeholders' opinions and attitudes towards nature conservation, the National Park and tourism within the territory which used to be closed to the public for 40 years due to the Iron Curtain. Without the knowledge of opinions of stakeholders it is not possible to manage nature conservation and development in the protected area properly. Using the method of direct interviews, 646 questionnaires where collected, of which 523 were from visitors and tourists, 115 from local residents and 8 from mayors of towns/villages. The questionnaires were analysed in order to detect differences in attitudes among the respondent groups in the following thematic areas: (a) the National Park, its environment and perception of it by respondents; (b) relationship of respondents to the territory; (c) tourism and attitudes towards recreational activities; (d) the Administration of the National Park and evaluation of its work; and (e) economic impact of tourism for local communities. One section of the study focused on comparing the attitudes between local inhabitants and mayors and the other section presents a collation of opinions from locals, mayors and tourists. Although a positive evaluation of the national park dominated the results, some negative attitudes and experiences were identified among locals. In addition, the situation also differed within communities. Results also indicated a relatively strong relationship to the territory by locals, but low job opportunities and income from tourism. The level of tourism intensity was perceived as an increasing and sometimes disturbing factor for local communities; motoring was observed as being the most negative activity for nature. The Administration of the Podyji/Thaya River Basin National Park was sometimes criticised and the communication with the community was not always evaluated satisfactorily. All groups of respondents identified waste management to be the most pressing issue. Identification of differences in attitudes of interviewed respondents may be effectively used in planning environmental management and sustainable tourism development in the area.

AB The recent surge of research on international retirement migration (IRM) in Europe has examined interlocking topics of interest to several fields of social research. The researchers, drawn mainly from population and social geography, social gerontology and sociology, have focused on the geographical distribution of international retirement migrants, their motivations, social circumstances and integration with local populations, and the health and welfare outcomes. Recent contributions have, however, begun to explore other aspects of the IRM phenomenon, particularly processes of transnational identity formation, the mental construction of home, Heimat and community, and the meaning of supra-national (i.e. European Union) citizenship. This paper argues that IRM research offers many other possibilities for the interchange and fusion of social research concepts and methodologies. Several dimensions of IRM, such as the sustainability of transnational mobility and lifestyles and the elaboration of supranational citizenship, are closely related to the current interests of transnationalism studies. Concepts and research questions from transnational studies could and should be added to research on IRM, while some interests of IRM studies, such as the distinctions made between a dwelling and a home and the mental construction of 'home away from home', engage with diaspora studies and offer a potential for productive comparative research. The transfer and exchange of concepts would sharpen and develop both research fields.

AB The combination of biomass gasification systems with fuel cells promises adequate systems for sustainable, decentralized energy conversion. Especially high temperature fuel cells are suited for this task because of their higher tolerance to impurities, their internal steam reforming potential, and favorable thermal integration possibilities. This paper presents the results of biosyngas utilization in solid oxide fuel cells with Ni/GDC anodes at 850 and 920 degrees C. The relation between the fuel composition and the electrochemical performance is discussed, as well as the impact of sulfur up to a concentration of 9 ppm H2S. The investigations have made clear that Ni/GDC anodes can be operated within a wide range of biosyngas compositions. Sulfur has appeared to deactivate the anode for methane reforming. The oxidation of hydrogen and carbon monoxide are insensitive to sulfur suggesting that both nickel and GDC are active electrocatalysts.

DE global warming; CO2 emission; steel industry; emission mitigation
ID IRON
AB The sustainable development against global warming is a challenge faced by societies at global level. For steel industry, the pressure of reducing CO, emission is likely to last many years. During the past decades, the CO2 emission per ton steel has been reduced mainly due to the improvement of energy efficiency. Entering the 21st century, the steel manufacturing route must have three functions, namely, production of high performance steel products, conversion of energy, and treatment of waste. In the near future, it is expected that existing BF-BOF and EAF routes will be improved, in order to produce high performance steels, increase the use of scrap, and integrate steel industry with other industries for mitigating CO2 emission. In the long term, using carbon-free energy, reducing agents, and storing CO2 securely or converting CO2 into a harmless substance can be presumed for tremendous reduction in CO2 emission.

TI Bamboo and wood fibre cement composites for sustainable infrastructure

CY OCT-NOV -, 2004

AB This paper describes the development of eco-friendly bamboo and wood fibre cement composites from agriculture wastes for applications in the housing and building industries, and for sustainable infrastructure regeneration. Bamboo flakes and fibres from oil palm tree fronds were produced and tested for their sugar content and effect on the setting and strength development of the portland cement matrix. To counteract the adverse effects on cement hydration, chemical accelerators, cement replacement materials or a combination of both were used in the manufacture of the composite boards. With the bamboo, the composition of the particleboard was optimized in terms of bamboo-cement ratio and the type and amount of chemical admixture to produce a composite with satisfactory strength and dimensional stability. For the production of wood fibre cement composites, cement replacement materials such as fly ash, rice husk ash and latex were used in conjunction with chemical admixtures to counteract the adverse effect on the hydration characteristics of the cement matrix. Tests were then carried out to optimize the amount and type of cement replacement material and chemical admixtures to produce boards with adequate strength and dimensional stability. All the strength and dimensional stability tests reported in the paper were carried out according to Malaysian Standard MS 934. The paper emphasizes the need for holistic design combining chemical admixtures, cement replacement materials and modern production technology to produce a wide range of cement-bonded composite boards, which will satisfy international standards and can be widely used for infrastructure regeneration.

AB Long-term control of Chagas disease requires not only interruption of the human transmission cycle of Trypanosoma cruzi Schyzotrypanum, Chagas, 1909 by controlling its domestic triatomine vectors but also surveillance to prevent reinfestation of residences from sylvatic or persistent peridomestic populations. Although a number of potential risk factors for infestation have been implicated in previous studies, the explanatory power of resulting models has been low. Two years after cessation of triatomine vector control efforts in the town of Chalcatzingo, Morelos, 78 environmental, socioecological, and spatial variables were analyzed for association with infestation by Triatoma pallidipennis Stal 1872 (Hemiptera: Reduviidae: Triatominae), the principal vector of T. cruzi. We studied 712 residences in this rural community to identify specific intradomestic and peridomestic risk factors that predicted infestation with T pallidipennis. From numerous characteristics that were identified as correlated with infestation, we derived multivariate logistic regression models to predict residences that were more or less likely to be infested with T pallidipennis. The most important risk factors for infestation included measurements of house age, upkeep, and spatial location in the town. The effects of certain risk factors on infestation were found to be modified by spatial characteristics of residences. The results of this study provide new information regarding risk factors for infestation by T. pallidipennis that may aid in designing sustainable disease control programs in rural Mexico.

AB Membrane technology is being increasingly used in the treatment of waters and wastewaters. The two main costs associated with the adoption of membrane filtration are the membrane module cost and the energy cost. Tradeoffs between selection of membrane capital cost and energy cost are usually identified for process optimisation; however, environmental tradeoffs associated with different operating conditions have received less attention. In order to ensure the sustainable use of membrane filtration, environmental considerations should also influence the choice of operating conditions. Here, we report on application of the method of life cycle assessment (LCA) to assess the environmental performance of different operating conditions of a microfiltration membrane (MF) process. Different membrane chemical cleaning options are compared in the sensitivity analysis component of the study. The results show that operating the MF process at a low flux with a high maximum transmembrane pressure (TMPmax) offers the most environmentally favourable outcome. The sensitivity analysis results show that in the low flux range, the choice of chemical cleaning frequency can affect the overall environmental performance of the process. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB Single-walled carbon nanotubes have been advocated as perfect candidates for the sustainable miniaturisation of electronic and mechanical nanoscale devices. The encapsulation of selected compounds within the inner hollow cavity of SWNTs allows controlled preparation of nano-meter size "nanowires" and "nanocables" with purpose-tailored physical properties. Therefore is crucial to have control of opening and closing their tips. In a previous study we showed that molten metal hydroxide [MOH (M=Cs, Na)] is filled into the carbon nanotubes and can be easily washed out with water leaving opened nanotubes. Following this approach we have explored the use of milder ways to open SWNTs that can be easily scalable for the production of large amount of opened SWNTs. The opened tubes have then successfully been filled in solution with various inorganic and organic materials.

TI The sustainability and future of unrecognized quasi-states
SO JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB The study of quasi-states has been marred by an unfortunate terminological confusion. Sometimes, this term is taken to mean recognized states that fail to develop the necessary state structures to function as fully fledged, 'real' states. At other times, I quasi-states' is a designation given to regions that secede from another state, gain de facto control over the territory they lay claim to, but fail to achieve international recognition. The author proposes that, in order to clear up this confusion, recognized but ineffectual states ought to be referred as 'failed states', while the term 'quasi-states' ought to be reserved for unrecognized, de facto states. Since quasi-states are not supported by international recognition, they must be sustained by something else. In contrast to researchers who maintain that the majority of these quasi-states arc quite strong, this article argues that their modal tendency is weak economy and weak state structures. The main reasons why these states nevertheless have not collapsed seem to be that they have managed to build up internal support from the local population through propaganda and identity-building; channel a disproportionately large part of their meager resources into military defense; enjoy the support of a strong patron; and, in most cases, have seceded from a state that is itself very weak.

ID COMMUNITY
AB Regional institutional integration is viewed by many as an essential precursor to the achievement of rural sustainability in that it addresses increasing concerns about institutional complexity in rural areas and the need to manage ecosystems at a bioregional scale. Governments are requiring planners to engage citizens, organizations, and institutions in regional strategic planning, regional organizational amalgamation, and regional administrative-boundary reconfiguration to achieve such integration. Despite this popularity, these approaches still are not well thought out. In particular, there has been little critical hypothesis development on institutions and regional integration by which planning practice toward achieving rural sustainability can be guided. This article seeks to show how certain elements of the scholarship in a range of disciplines within and outside planning can shed light on the different dimensions of this concept. This review enables important lessons to be drawn for planners, citizens, and governments concerned with institutions, integration, and the environment.

TI Light intensity effects on growth and micronutrient uptake by tropical
   legume cover crops
SO JOURNAL OF PLANT NUTRITION

DE nutrient transport; nutrient flux; nutrient efficiency ratio; root and
   shoot weight
AB Cover crops are important components of a sustainable crop-production system in plantation crops such as cacao (theobroma cacao), coffee (Coffee arabica), oil palm (Elaeis Spp.), and banana (Musa Spp.). Optimal growth of cover crops in plantation agriculture is determined by adaptability of crop species, light intensity reaching their leaf canopies, and their nutrient-use efficiencies, including those of micronutrients. An experiment was conducted in a climatically controlled growth chamber to evaluate the influence of levels of light intensity on growth and micronutrient [ boron (B), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), and zinc (Zn)] uptake parameters in legume cover crops. Two photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD, 200 and 400 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) light treatments were imposed on nine legume species (joint vetch (Aeschynomene americana), sunhemp (Crotalaria juncea L.), Crotalaria rchroleuca, showy crotalaria (crotalaria spectabilis), hairy indigo (Indigofera hirsute L.), lab-lab (Lablab purpureus), sesbania (Sesbania microcarpa), Brazilian stylo (Stylosanthes guianensis), and cowpea (Vigna unguiculata)). Overall, light intensity significantly affected growth, micronutrient uptake, and use-efficiency ratios; with few exceptions, interactions between cover crop species and PPFD were also significant. Such PPFD x crop species interactions show that the cover crops used in this study differed in growth and nutrient-uptake parameters under the conditions imposed. Sunhemp, cowpea, sesbania, and lab-lab species were superior in producing shoot dry weight and in nutrient accumulation compared with other species at lower as well as at higher PPFD levels. Interspecific differences in nutrient influx and transport were observed. Influx and transport of micronutrients was in the order Mn > B > Fe > Zn > Cu. Overall, growth, nutrient uptake, and use- efficiency ratios were higher at higher PPFD than at lower PPFD. Results of this study indicate that the use of proper crop species at adequate light intensities is an important component of successful cultivation of cover crops in plantation agriculture.

AB European Agenda 2000 considers the integration of environment in CAP and the role farmers can play on natural resources management.
   Alternative tillage technologies to seed cereals play an important economic and environmental role on the development of a sustainable agriculture and its adoption may depend on the agricultural policy, particularly policies on income support.
   The results obtained clearly show that the use of alternative soil tillage technologies would be promoted by the change of supports from the first to the second pillar of CAP and we can conclude that, in general, this change will encourage a faster technological adoption.

DT Article
DE funding; program management; sustainability; youth development; youth
   programs
AB Drawing on data collected through evaluations of youth development (YD) programs, including those offered in community-and school-based after-school programs, this article describes practices that support program managers' quests for funds that will sustain programs. Designing YD activities to incorporate skills building (including educational) and recreational and fun activities for adolescents can enlarge the resource pool to include funds for educational activities and youth engagement. Strong behavioral management of programs encourages youth attendance and provides a safe environment to develop positive peer and adult relationships, both of which are crucial to YD. Strong attendance, in turn, can keep program costs in line with expectations and reduce the marginal costs for additional participants, Faithful implementation of previously tested program models increases the likelihood that the program will be effective, and positive outcomes are essential to sustained funding.

AB Prior to the 1950s, thornback ray (Raja clavata L.) was common and widely distributed in the seas of Northwest Europe. Since then, it has decreased in abundance and geographic range due to over-fishing. The sustainability of ray populations is of concern to fisheries management because their slow growth rate, late maturity and low fecundity make them susceptible to exploitation as victims of by-catch. We investigated the population genetic structure of thornback rays from 14 locations in the southern North Sea, English Channel and Irish Sea. Adults comprised < 4% of the total sampling despite heavy sampling effort over 47 hauls; thus our results apply mainly to sexually immature individuals. Using five microsatellite loci, weak but significant population differentiation was detected with a global F-ST = 0.013 (P < 0.001). Pairwise F-st was significant for 75 out of 171 comparisons. Although earlier tagging studies suggest restricted foraging distances from home areas, the absence of genetic differentiation between some distant populations suggests that a substantial fraction of individuals migrate over wide areas. Autumn/winter locations appear to have a lower level of differentiation than spring/summer, which could be due to seasonal migration. Management and conservation of thornback ray populations will be challenging as population structure appears to be dynamic in space and time. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Tolerable soil loss (T) is defined as the maximum rate of annual soil erosion that economically and indefinitely will continue to sustain a high level of crop productivity. Currently a T value is assigned to a soil based on its current functional state and structural integrity. However, in India a default T value Of 11.2 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) (5.0 t ac(-1) yr(-1)) is being followed. Our objective is to provide adjusted T values for India's Northwest Himalayan region by incorporating bulk density, water stable aggregate measurements, infiltration rate, soil carbon, and fertility status into the assessment. A quantitative model was used to sum up overall soil performance to define the current state of soil resource. Scaling functions were used to convert soil parameters to a 0 to 1 scale. The normalized values were then multiplied by appropriate weighting factors based on relative importance and sensitivity analysis of each indicator. A categorical ranking of soil 1, 2, or 3 was given to a soil group based on the overall assessment. A general guideline developed by the USDA-Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) was followed to calculate soil toss tolerance for each soil group using effective soil depth. Adjusted T values for the area ranged between 5.0 and 12.5 Mg ha 1 yr(-1) (2.2 and 5.6 t ac 1 yr(-1)) compared to 11.2 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) (5.0 t ac(-1) yr(-1)). Use of the adjusted T values will improve conservation planning, help meet erosion control regulations for development of sustainable farm operations, and improve watershed management in this portion of India.

AB Background. Grazing animals have a dominant effect on the movement and utilization of nutrients through the soil and plant system, and thus on the fertility of pasture soils. Grazing can accelerate and alter the timing of nutrient transfers, and increase the amount of nutrients cycled from plant to soil. Long periods, position of shade, and water resources for grazing cattle can influence the spatial distribution of soil biochemical properties including soil organic carbon (C), total extractable inorganic nitrogen (TEIN), and Melich 1 extractable total phosphorus (TP). Baseline soil samples around and beneath three congregations sites in established (> 10 yr) grazed beef cattle pastures at the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Agricultural Research Service (ARS), Subtropical Agricultural Research Station (STARS), Brooksville, FL, were collected in 2003, 2004, and 2005.
   Objective. The objective of this study is to test whether cattle congregation sites typical on most Florida ranches, such as mineral feeders, water troughs, and shade areas are more nutrient-rich and may contribute more nutrients to surface and ground-water supply than in other pasture locations under Florida conditions.
   Results. The levels of soil TEIN and TP were significantly (p <= 0.001) affected by the interaction of congregation sites and distance away from the center of the sites. Mineral feeders had the highest concentration of TP followed by shades and water troughs. The concentrations of soil TP decreased almost linearly, with distance (x = meter) away from the center of the mineral feeders (-5.24x + 55.10; R-2 = 0.92; p <= 0.001) and the shades (-6.25x + 57.21; R-2 = 0.85; p <= 0.001). However, the level of TP around the water troughs (-0.25x + 16.91; R-2 = 0.09) does not appear to change significantly with distance, staying close to about 13-18 mg kg(-1). The levels of TEIN decreased linearly with distance away from the mineral feeders from the center of the shades. A linear model can describe the relationship between TERN and distance away from the center of shades: -11.3x + 78.2; R-2 = 0.95; p <= 0.001. The shaded sites (34.25 +/- 1.7 mg kg(-1)) had higher levels than the mineral feeders (7.22 +/- 0.60 mg kg(-1)) or water troughs (10.06 +/- 0.8 mg kg(-1)) sites.
   Discussion. The higher soil TP near and around the mineral feeders can be attributed to the presence of phosphorus in the supplemental feeds. The average level of soil TP in the mineral feeders of 34.05 +/- 0.44 mg kg(-1) was not high enough to be of environmental concern. Losses of soil phosphorus by overland flow are becoming a big concern when the concentrations for soil phosphorus exceeded 150 mg kg-1 in the upper 20 cm of soils. With TEIN, the shaded sites (34.25 +/- 1.7 mg kg(-1)) had either higher levels than the mineral feeders (7.22 +/- 0.60 mg kg(-1)) or water trough (10.06 +/- 0.80 mg kg(-1)) sites. Higher TEIN content at the shade sites may have been more likely due to frequent urination of animals and lack of vegetation immediately adjacent to shades. The lack of vegetation within and/or near the shades then had no uptake mechanism for removal of inorganic nitrogen, unlike the heavy demand for inorganic nitrogen by bahiagrass in other areas of the pasture. An accumulation of TEIN immediately adjacent to shades could lead to a potential point source that would be susceptible to leaching or gaseous losses to the environment.
   Conclusions. Early results of the study are suggesting that cattle congregation sites in beef cattle operations in Florida are not nutrient-rich, therefore may not contribute more nutrients to surface and groundwater supply under Florida conditions.
   Recommendations and Perspectives. Since there is no apparent vertical build up or horizontal movement of TEIN and TP in the landscape, we can then surmise that cattle congregation sites may be considered not a potential source of nutrients at the watershed level, at least on the sand ridge soils in Florida. Further research is continuing, including sampling at cattle congregation sites at other locations in north and south Florida, which started in July 2004.

TI Racking performance of structural insulated panels
SO JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
DE timber construction; wooden structures; panels
AB Formed from a thick layer of polystyrene foam sandwiched between two layers of oriented strand board, structural insulated panels (SIPs) are a viable alternative to traditional wood stud shear walls. Developed in North America, SIPs satisfy building performance criteria while being both sustainable and cost effective. This paper details a comprehensive experimental and parametric study at Napier University examining the structural performance of shear walls constructed of SIPs under the action of both racking loads and combined bending and axial compression. The effects of size and position of openings, for doors and windows, were examined and compared to designs carried out in accordance with BS 5268 and Eurocode 5. The study has demonstrated that SIPs perform as an effective composite material possessing the strength and stiffness necessary to sustain required design loads.

ID BARRIER PROPERTIES
AB Poly(lactide) (PLA) polymers are environmentally-friendly biodegradable materials that have garnered growing attention in the past few years as food packaging materials since packages made from PLA have the advantage of being produced from renewable resources, provides significant energy savings, and can be recyclable and compostable. PLA's optical, physical, and mechanical properties have been compared to those of polystyrene (PS) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) although studies comparing and showing the actual performance of PLA, PS, and PET packages are scarce. The purpose of this study was to investigate and to compare the role of PLA for the food service industry. Two of the commonly used materials to make containers to package fresh food, PET and oriented polystyrene (OPS), were compared with oriented PLA (OPLA). This study involved a number of tests to quantify the physical, mechanical, barrier, and compatibility properties that would affect the selection criteria for containers to be used for food service applications. Based on the results, OPLA, OPS, and PET performances were evaluated. Exposures of the three materials to weak and strong acids for seven days show a minimal reduction in the performance of these polymers. At ambient temperature, PET has the highest impact resistance followed by OPLA and OPS. PET shows the highest oxygen barrier followed by OPLA and OPS. Thus, several of the relevant properties for packaging applications of OPLA are between PET and OPS properties, suggesting that OPLA would also be suitable for some of these applications.

TI Single step hair removal and fiber opening process: Simultaneous and
   successive addition of protease and alpha-amylase
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN LEATHER CHEMISTS ASSOCIATION
LA English
DT Article
ID LIME
AB The use of enzyme based products for many areas in leather making has found its way into commercial practice. Proteolysis and alpha-amylase enzymes have found use in hair removal and fiber opening, producing comparable results to the conventional practice of lime and sulfide based dehairing and fiber opening. However, this process is a two step sequence in which dehairing is performed by the proteolysis enzyme followed by fiber opening through alpha-amylase. This study aims at transforming the two-step method into a single-step process, while maintaining environmental sustainability. Experiments were carried out using various percentages of dehairing enzyme and alpha-amylase following successive, simultaneous addition. The order of addition of the enzymes is also varied. Standardization experiments at bulk level were carried out to obtain best results. The leathers obtained from simultaneous addition of enzymes (1% protease and 0.75% alpha-amylase) were comparable to that of the conventionally produced leathers in terms of physical properties and appearance. The input-output analysis shows complete dehairing and fiber opening, which is also confirmed through scanning electron micrographs. There is reasonable reduction in water consumption, wastewater discharge, COD and TS loads when compared to the conventional leather processing.

TI Searching for social capital: historical perspectives on health, poverty
   and culture
SO JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY FOR THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
DE culture; history; Robert Putnam; social capital; underclass
AB Social capital has been seen as having a positive effect on health, and the concept of social capital has been viewed as of central importance to debates about healthy, sustainable communities. More generally, behaviour and its relationship with health has become much more central to policy-making, as illustrated in the Choosing Health White Paper (2005), and the concept of social capital has been one influence on the concept of social exclusion. Robert Putnam's arguments, both those expressed in Making Democracy Work (1993) and the revised version seen in Bowling Alone (2000) have been taken up by numerous social scientists and policy-makers. But despite the explicitly historical perspective that Putnam employs in Bowling Alone in particular, the history of social capital remains rather neglected in the available literature. This article is concerned with providing a historical perspective on social capital, especially the ways in which social investigators have viewed the relationships between health, poverty and behaviour. The article puts social capital alongside that of 'underclass' concepts such as the culture of poverty thesis, and examines how the latter has been invented and reinvented in the UK and the USA over the last 120 years. It argues that there are important similarities between the culture of poverty and social capital, but also significant differences, and these have implications for current policy initiatives. One way of analysing concepts like social capital and social exclusion more rigorously is by locating them within this longer-term history of social investigation, in which debates about health, poverty, and culture have been of key significance.

SO JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY
LA English
DT Article
DE quality of life; sustainability; transport pricing policy; car use
AB This paper examines how a transport pricing policy aimed to reduce car use may affect individuals' Quality of Life (QoL), to what extent this policy is acceptable to the public and if people intend to change car use when the policy is implemented. Also, comparisons were made amongst five countries (Austria, Czech Republic, Italy, The Netherlands and Sweden). An internet survey among 490 respondents showed that a stringent measure, i.e., doubling costs of car use, hardly affects people's general QoL. Respondents are unsure whether they would accept the policy and whether they intend to change their car use if the policy is implemented. Respondents from The Netherlands and Sweden are more pessimistic about the QoL consequences of the policy, think the policy is less acceptable and are less inclined to reduce car use than respondents from the Czech Republic, Italy and, to a lesser degree, Austria. Implications and recommendations for developing, adjusting or supplementing QoL measurement instruments and policies are discussed to ensure effective and efficient policy making.

AB In order to address the social, physical and economic determinants of urban health, researchers, public health practitioners, and community members have turned to more comprehensive and participatory approaches to research and interventions. One such approach, community-based participatory research (CBPR) in public health, has received considerable attention over the past decade, and numerous publications have described theoretical underpinnings, values, principles and practice. Issues related to the long-term sustainability of partnerships and activities have received limited attention. The purpose of this article is to examine the experiences and lessons learned from three Urban Research Centers (URCs) in Detroit, New York City, and Seattle, which were initially established in 1995 with core support from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The experience of these Centers after core funding ceased in 2003 provides a case study to identify the challenges and facilitating factors for sustaining partnerships. We examine three broad dimensions of CBPR partnerships that we consider important for sustainability: (1) sustaining relationships and commitments among the partners involved, (2) sustaining the knowledge, capacity and values generated from the partnership; and (3) sustaining funding, staff, programs, policy changes and the partnership itself. We discuss the challenges faced by the URCS in sustaining these dimensions and the strategies used to overcome these challenges. Based on these experiences, we offer recommendations for: strategies that partnerships may find useful in sustaining their CBPR efforts; ways in which a Center mechanism can be useful for promoting sustainability; and considerations for funders of CBPR to increase sustainability.

AB This paper presents an integrated hydrologic-economic modeling framework for optimizing conjunctive use of surface and groundwater at the river basin scale. Integrated river basin modeling with distributed groundwater simulation and dynamic stream-aquifer interaction allows a more realistic representation of conjunctive use and the associated economic results. The use of an economic objective function, maximizing the net economic value of water use, provides solutions that optimize economic efficiency in water resources management. Constraints guarantee the feasibility and sustainability of suggested operations. A nonlinear optimization model is presented for the Adra River Basin system (Spain). Model results suggest a variety of water management and operation strategies and indicate where significant the economic benefits can be obtained through capacity expansion. A procedure allowing a systematic assessment of the economic indicators required by the European Water Framework Directive (WFD) is provided. The shadow values of water balance constraints provide time series of marginal economic value of water at different locations, from which indicators of the WFD's "resource cost" can be derived. The opportunity cost of satisfying minimum ecological streamflow, reservoir storage, or piezometric head constraints to achieve the required "good water status" can be assessed by the corresponding shadow values.

AB This article describes the application and evaluation of a clinical nursing leadership model to enhance continence care in an inpatient rehabilitation setting for older adults. Multiple strategies were employed to optimize the uptake and sustainability of 3 practice initiatives: (1) establishment of an enhanced role for ward-based nurses to provide clinical support to patients and other staff for the management of incontinence, (2) a new method for nursing assessment and management of bowel elimination, and (3) a framework for improved discharge care of patients with incontinence. Evaluation data indicated a high level of acceptance of the role of the ward-based continence resource nurses, improved assessment and management of bowel elimination, and enhanced discharge care for patients with incontinence. These initiatives were sustainable during a 2-year period after their introduction, despite the gradual withdrawal of the clinical leader.

AB The response of a cylindrical premixed flame to periodic concentration fluctuation was investigated. The flame was formed in a porous cylinder by percolating a lean methane-air mixture uniformly through the cylinder wall. The burner used here was devised so as to cause fluctuations of the mixture concentration (equivalence ratio) only in the radial direction of the flow (vertically to the cylindrical flame surface) without varying the flow field. Using this burner, the time variations of burning velocity, burnt gas temperature and flame luminosity were measured for the mixture in a range of fluctuation frequencies from 3 to 50 Hz, and the results were examined from the viewpoint of flame curvature effects. The results show that the variation width of the burning velocity of the dynamic flame is larger than that of the static flame in the concentration range corresponding to the fluctuation. Burnt gas temperature and flame luminosity also exhibit similar tendencies. The magnification ratio of the variation width depends on the flame curvature, and a large flame curvature results in a sustainable flame, even for a mixture leaner than the flammability limit of the static flame.

AB Currently at least 20 percent of the world's irrigated land is salt-affected. However, projections of global population growth, and of an increased demand for food and fibre, suggest that larger areas of salt-affected soil will need to be cropped in the future. About 60 percent of salt-affected soils are sodic, and much of this land is farmed by smallholders. Ameliorating such soils requires the application of a source of calcium (Ca2+), which replaces excess sodium (Na+) at the cation exchange sites. The displaced Na+ is then leached from the root zone through excess irrigation, a process that requires adequate flows of water through the soil. However, it must now be recognized that we can no longer conduct sodic soil amelioration and management solely with the aim of achieving high levels of crop productivity. The economic, social, and environmental impacts of different soil-amelioration options must also be considered. A holistic approach is therefore needed. This should consider the cost and availability of the inputs needed for amelioration, the soil depth, the level to which sodicity needs to be reduced to allow cropping, the volume and quality of drainage water generated during amelioration, and the options available for drainage-water disposal or reuse. The quality and cost of water available for post-amelioration crops, and the economic value of the crops grown during and after amelioration should also be taken into account, as should farmers' livelihoods, the environmental implications of amelioration (such as carbon sequestration), and the long-term sustainable use of the ameliorated site (in terms of productivity and market value). Consideration of these factors, with the participation of key stakeholders, could sustainably improve sodic soil productivity and help to transform such soils into a useful economic resource. Such an approach would also aid environmental conservation, by minimizing the chances of secondary sodicity developing in soils, particularly under irrigated agriculture.

ID MIGRATION
AB Migration is an emerging development strategy embraced by the state and elites in El Salvador As primary export prices decline and nontraditional agricultural exports and assembly production fail to fulfill their promise of compensating for reduced export volumes and sales, exporting people has become an increasingly viable strategy for recruiting foreign exchange, reducing poverty, and injecting new capital into the financial sector. Yet the ability to capitalize on these resources is limited within the current neoliberal model. Migration can act as a safety valve, relieving pressure on the economy and sopping up excess labor but it is unlikely that the flow of remittances can dynamize the economy and anchor long-term sustainable growth.

AB Fisheries management receives valuable, but often fragmented information from academic disciplines such as biology, economics, and social sciences. A multi-disciplinary perspective seems to be necessary if the fisheries are to become sustainable. Globally, overcapacity is considered as the most serious threat to sustainable fisheries, which indicates the need for a stronger integration of technological aspects into fisheries management. This paper discusses application of systems engineering principles and integration of technology into fisheries management. The systems engineering process facilitates implementation of multi-disciplinary information from researchers to fisheries managers in the decision-making towards sustainable fisheries, but may also be used to overcome multi-disciplinary obstacles among scientists. The article concludes that use of systems engineering principles may become a valuable contribution to fisheries management because of increased transparency and reduced risk associated with the decision-making process.

AB Although overexploitation of commercial fish stocks in European waters has been in the public debate now for more than 20 years, the European Union has so far failed to implement sustainable fisheries management. Millions in subsidies paid to the fishing industry have led to significant excess capacity in the fishing fleet. Various feeble attempts to stop overexploitation of marine resources have failed. The cause is that fishing policy is highly dominated by short-term socioeconomic interests. There is an urgent need for a new fisheries management system in Europe that supports reductions in the fishing fleet, increases responsibility among fishers and guarantees long-term conservation of natural marine resources.
   Transferable rights to fish have proved a reliable and effective means of creating incentives to conserve marine resources. By strengthening individual fishing rights under flexible quota management systems, the EU Member States could, within the Common Fisheries Policy, make a significant contribution to conserving fish stocks, to reducing excess capacity and to raising the profitability of the fisheries industry. A closer look at existing reservations against a flexible management system shows most of the objections to be overstated or capable of resolution. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID FISH-MEAL; MODELS; PIGS
AB Fishmeal is a critically important feed ingredient for use in animal (e.g., poultry and pigs) and aquaculture production (e.g., salmon, trout and shrimp). There is great concern that increasing demand for fishmeal will place stress on the world's pelagic fisheries and may undermine the sustainability of aquaculture systems. Our research shows that after 1998 the fishmeal sector changed. The change has increased costs for animal and fish producers, which seems to have acted as a stimulus for innovation. The results have considerable implications for the management and health of pelagic fisheries. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Since the 1970s, small-scale fisheries have had an important place in fisheries social science and in fisheries management. While there has been substantial discussion of what constitutes the category of small-scale fisheries, its considerable ambiguity is nevertheless often passed over. This paper argues that while the category of scale fisheries can be best understood in terms of scale, the underlying reason for the power of the category lies in the values of social justice and ecological sustainability that it has come to represent in response to dominant high modern narratives of change. Fisheries governance may better be served by prioritising these values rather than by making a fetish out of small-scale fisheries. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The Sustainable Livelihoods Approach (SLA) combines a conceptual framework with a set of operational principles to provide guidance on policy formulation and development practice. The SLA has been widely used in coastal and fisheries development research and has informed the design of development programmes but experience of operationalising it remains largely undocumented. In the Sustainable Fisheries Livelihoods Programme, which involves 25 West African countries, the SLA has helped to align fisheries policy with wider poverty reduction initiatives and to identify means of contributing to poverty reduction that do not directly increase pressure on fully or over-exploited fish resources.

AB Individual fishery quotas (IFQs) are an increasingly prevalent form of fishery management around the world, with more than 170 species currently managed with IFQs. Yet, because of the difficulties in matching quota holdings with catches, many argue that IFQs are not appropriate for multispecies fisheries. Using on-the-ground-experience with multispecies IFQ fisheries in Iceland, New Zealand, Australia, and Canada, we assess the design and use of catch-quota balancing mechanisms. Our methodology includes a mix of interviews with fishery managers, industry representatives, and brokers, literature review, and data analysis. We find that a combination of incentives and limits on use rates for the mechanisms provide sufficient flexibility to the quota owner without the fishery manager incurring excessive levels of overexploitation risk. Contrary to some opinions, these programs are evidence that it is possible to implement IFQ programs for multispecies fisheries and that they can be profitable and sustainable.

AB This paper examines lessons from past approaches to natural disasters, as well as early lessons from the post-2004 Asian tsunami rehabilitation, to draw out general principles for rehabilitating livelihoods in poor coastal communities. We contend that avoiding the mistakes of the past requires: (1) a framework for understanding the diversity of coastal people's livelihood strategies and the sources of their vulnerability, (2) a process for designing interventions that build on this understanding in order to strengthen and revitalize coastal communities, including a means of assessing and selecting the most promising livelihood options, and (3) a focus on the longer-term challenge of building future resilience and sustainability in the communities by addressing the root causes of vulnerability.

AB The contentious whaling dispute can be described as a scientific dispute over resource management, the collision between nations that regard whales as food and nations that see whales as special, political game played by politicians who like to be seen as environmentally conscious by opposing whaling, and economic interests of the whaling industry and fundraising anti-whaling organizations. All of these different interpretations are correct, however, none, by themselves, can explain the whole picture of the controversy. This paper, by constructing a matrix, presents a comprehensive picture of this complex dispute and some options for making a progress. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID COMMUNITIES; TURTLES; FACE; SEA
AB Industrial longline fishing can be understood as a case study of the cultural, economic, environmental and social impacts of unsustainable fishing technology. While much attention has been attributed to the impact of industrial longlines on the marine ecosystem, little is known about the impact of longline fishing on local food security, employment, cultural belief systems and traditions, revenue generation from marine tourism and climate change. New data demonstrate that the contributions of Marine Protected Areas, marine tourism and recreational fishing to local coastal economies dwarf the contributions, of longline fishing. When combined with the impact of overfishing on coastal fishing communities and fish consumers, policies promoting sustainable fisheries must be expanded to take these other factors into account along with issues of biodiversity.

TI Slowing the brain drain: FAIMER education programs
SO MEDICAL TEACHER
LA English
DT Article
AB Migration of physicians has produced serious shortages in many developing countries. The Foundation for Advancement of International Medical Education and Research (FAIMER) is attempting to show this international brain drain through creation of faculty development programs for medical school faculty from developing countries in order to strengthen medical education and help build a sustainable discipline of medical education. The goals of these programs are to allow Fellows to acquire basic skills in medical education, skills in leadership and management, and build a strong community of practice. Acquisition of these skills will improve medical education in their home country, stimulate growth of the field of medical education, and improve opportunities for professional advancement. Three programs currently exist: the FAIMER Institute, a two year fellowship with residential and distance learning components; International Fellowships in Medical Education, which funds selected Institute alumni to obtain masters degrees in medical education; and FAIMER regional institutes, which use the principles and structure embedded in the FAIMER Institute to build faculty development programs overseas. Evaluation of FAIMER programs indicates approximately one-third of Fellows have been promoted, and that a community of medical educators is being created in many developing countries which may promote retention of these physicians.

DT Article
AB As the highest and most impressive features of the landscape, mountains have an unusual power to awaken a sense of the sacred. Their soaring summits, the clouds and thunder that swirl about their peaks, the life-giving waters that flow from their heights, these and other characteristics imbue them with an aura of mystery and sanctity. In that aura, people of diverse backgrounds, both traditional and modem, experience a deeper reality that gives meaning and vitality to their lives. Drawing on many of the themes associatecl with sacred mountains around the world, The Mountain Institute in Washington DC has developed with the US National Park Service innovative educational activities that highlight the spiritual and cultural meanings of natural features of mountain environments in different cultures. The purpose of the project is to connect a broad range of visitors with nature, enrich their experiences, and give them deep-seated, sustainable reasons for conserving the environment, Efforts to conserve the environmental integrity and cultural diversity associated with sacred mountains need to involve the many diverse peoples and traditions that revere and care for them.

TI Spiritual values in Madagascar - The starting point for endogenous
   conservation initiatives
SO MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Ancestors, taboos, spirits, rice, and cattle are Madagascar's strongest traditional foundations-indispensable "food" for most, if not all, rural Malagasy people. On the other hand, nationalism, "development," private enterprise, and conservation of biodiversity are unavoidable modem spin-offs of globalization that influence Malagasy life, even in the most remote mountain areas. How do Malagasy people deal with these opposing forces, and can they negotiate ways of life that integrate both traditional and modem values? As illustrated in the present article, experience shows that members of rural civil society, proudly upholding traditional values and remaining strongly rooted in natural and spiritual worlds such as ancestors, spirits, and sacred sites (figure 1), can become committed actors and promoters of Voluntary Protected Area (VPA) initiatives. Ancestral spirituality, local knowledge and traditional practices, previously-seen as obstacles to conservation and development, can-in partnership with scientific ecological and economic understanding-become effective tools and offer solutions for biodiversity conservation and sustainable mountain development.

AB Understanding of how best to support those most vulnerable to climate stress is imperative given expected changes in climate variability. This paper investigates local adaptation strategies to climate variability, focusing on agricultural decision-making in a communal irrigation scheme in Vhembe District, Limpopo Province, South Africa. Research done through interviews, surveys and participatory methods demonstrates that adaptation strategies within a community are socially differentiated and present differing objectives and priorities. These results highlight the need for intervention and policy that support a heterogeneous response to a wide range of stresses. Evidence for climate change is clear and the need for adaptation is urgent. However, adaptation measures have to be sensitively integrated with ongoing development pathways to ensure they are sustainable and relevant to local priorities.

AB The soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamic is a key element of soil fertility in savannah ecosystems that form the key agricultural lands in sub-Saharan Africa. In the western part of Burkina Faso, the land use is mostly linked to cotton-based cropping systems. Use of mechanization, pesticides, and herbicides has induced modifications of the traditional shifting cultivation and increased the need for sustainable soil fertility management. The SOC dynamic was assessed based on a large typology of land cultivation intensity at Bondoukui. Thus, 102 farm plots were sampled at a soil depth of 0-15 cm, considering field-fallow successions, the cultivation phase duration, tillage intensity, and soil texture. Physical fractionation of SOC was carried out by separating the following particle size classes: 2,000-200, 200-50, 50-20, and 0-20 mu m. The results exhibited an increase in SOC stock, and a lower depletion rate with increase in clay content. After a long-term fallow period, the land cultivation led to an annual loss of 31.5 g m(-2) (2%) of its organic carbon during the first 20 years. The different fractions of SOC content were affected by this depletion depending on cultivation intensity. The coarse SOC fraction (2,000-200 mu m) was the most depleted. The ploughing-in of organic matter (manure, crop residues) and the low frequency of the tillage system produced low soil carbon loss compared with annual ploughing. Human-induced disturbances (wildfire, overgrazing, fuel wood collection, decreasing fallow duration, increasing crop duration) in savannah land did not permit the SOC levels to reach those of the shifting cultivation system.

AB The sustainability of cereal/legume intercropping was assessed by monitoring trends in grain yield, soil organic C (SOC) and soil extractable P (Olsen method) measured over 13 years at a long-term field trial on a P-deficient soil in semi-arid Kenya. Goat manure was applied annually for 13 years at 0, 5 and 10 t ha(-1) and trends in grain yield were not identifiable because of season-to-season variations. SOC and Olsen P increased for the first seven years of manure application and then remained constant. The residual effect of manure applied for four years only lasted another seven to eight years when assessed by yield, SOC and Olsen P. Mineral fertilizers provided the same annual rates of N and P as in 5 t ha(-1) manure and initially ,gave the same yield as manure, declining after nine years to about 80%. Therefore, manure applications could be made intermittently and nutrient requirements topped-up with fertilizers. Grain yields for sorghum with continuous manure were described well by correlations with rainfall and manure input only, if data were excluded for seasons with over 500 mm rainfall. A comprehensive simulation model should correctly describe crop losses caused by excess water.

AB Purpose. This article describes the development of, and outputs from, a program in which trained refugee health workers provided spherical lenses to adult refugees along the Thailand-Burma border.
   Methods. Between 1998 and 2001, the International Rescue Committee trained 48 refugee health workers in basic refraction courses. Once trained, these health workers conduct weekly eye clinics in several refugee camps and one migrant community covering a total population of 142,000. We supplied spherical lenses in 11 powers from +1.00 to +4.00 in 0.50-D steps and from -1.00 to -2.50 in 0.50-D steps. We collected output data from these clinics for the year 2001.
   Results. In 2001, these clinics provided a total of 7219 eyeglasses. Approximately 84% of all lenses given were for presbyopia, approximately 10% for myopia, and approximately 6% for hyperopia. Our spectacle provision rates per 100,000 persons were 4284 for presbyopia, 482 for myopia, and 317 for hyperopia. Our target provision rates, which would allow the average wearer to get a new pair every 3 to 4 years, was met for presbyopia, but not met for myopia or hyperopia. Few corrections for high errors were needed and only 92 people were found to need powers higher than we provided. In 2001, the cost per eyeglass recipient was approximately $7.00.
   Conclusions. Training refugee health workers has allowed for sustainable, low-cost spectacle provision to a large population over an extensive geographic area in a challenging environment.

AB Spatial patterns of tree mortality are important factors in analysis of forest health and sustainable forest management. We analyzed spatial cluster characteristics of forest tree mortality among hardwoods, softwoods, and all species groups between 1989 and 1997 in Georgia. We used for this purpose the 1989 and 1997 USDA Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) permanent sample plot data, spatial scan statistic and semivariogram analysis methods, and geographic information system (GIS) techniques. In Georgia, forest tree mortality for softwoods and all species groups formed clusters in North Georgia in 1989. These clusters became more widespread, but the aggregation intensity of tree mortality was decreased compared with that of the 1989 clusters. Another finding is that the locations for mortality clusters of softwoods were almost the same as those of all species combined both in 1989 and in 1997. In 1989 the forest tree mortality of softwoods and all species groups agglomerated with small clusters forming in north Georgia. In 1997, these clusters became more widespread, but the magnitudes of tree mortality within them decreased compared with those of 1989 clusters. Semivariogram analysis suggests that hardwoods, softwoods, and all species combined followed a similar trend for spatial variation in that they fit a spherical model of tree mortality. However, the strengths of spatial dependence were significantly different among the hardwoods, softwoods, and all species in 1989 and 1997. The higher the agglomeration of tree mortality, the stronger the spatial dependence. Spatial analysis of tree damage indicates that agents of tree damage were also agglomerated in the state. Eight kinds of tree damage, possibly combined with other kinds of damage, directly determined the spatial patterns of forest tree mortality. Out of these eight, only vegetation competition, insects, and weather caused the formation of the north Georgia tree mortality clusters.

AB Changes of the soil chemical status during the recent 22-30 years at two historically degraded forest sites in southern Germany (Pfaffenwinkel, Pustert) stocked with mature Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stands were studied by repeated soil inventories conducted in 1974, 1982-1984, 1994, and 2004 on replicated control plots of fertilization experiments, allowing a statistical analysis. Additionally, the nutritional status of the stands at all plots was monitored from 1964 until 2004 by annual or bi-annual analysis of current-year foliage, and stand growth was assessed by repeated stand inventories carried out in 3- to 9-year intervals. For both sites, a statistically significant systematic decrease of the forest floor C/N ratio between 1974 and 2004 from 35.4 to 29.2 (Pfaffenwinkel) and from 36.5 to 23.0 (Pustert) was observed. The soils at both sites also showed a considerable accumulation of organic carbon (210 and 400 kg C ha(-1) year(-1) for Pfaffenwinkel and Pustert, respectively) and nitrogen (13 and 18 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)). In addition, the mineral topsoil at both sites has acidified considerably, indicated by significantly decreased pH values (Pustert only; mean decrease 0.1 units per decade), base saturation, and base cation stocks. The trend of N enrichment and base cation loss in the soils is mirrored by the trends of stand nutrition at both sites, which are characterized by improved N nutrition and reduced supply with K, Mg (Pustert only), and Ca. The results confirm findings of other studies indicating a recent N eutrophication and acidification of forest soils in Central Europe and southern Scandinavia. Since soils with historic degradation due to earlier non-sustainable forest utilization are widespread in Central Europe, the results obtained on our study sites probably apply for large forested areas, suggesting a significant potential of Central European forests to sequester atmospheric carbon and nitrogen not only in stand biomass, but also in the soil.

AB Resources for biodiversity conservation are severely limited, requiring strategic investment. Understanding both the economic benefits and costs of conserving ecosystems will help to allocate scarce dollars most efficiently. However, although cost-benefit analyses are common in many areas of policy, they are not typically used in conservation planning. We conducted a spatial evaluation of the costs and benefits of conservation for a landscape in the Atlantic forests of Paraguay. We considered five ecosystem services ( i.e., sustainable bushmeat harvest, sustainable timber harvest, bioprospecting for pharmaceutical products, existence value, and carbon storage in aboveground biomass) and compared them to estimates of the opportunity costs of conservation. We found a high degree of spatial variability in both costs and benefits over this relatively small (similar to 3,000 km(2)) landscape. Benefits exceeded costs in some areas, with carbon storage dominating the ecosystem service values and swamping opportunity costs. Other benefits associated with conservation were more modest and exceeded costs only in protected areas and indigenous reserves. We used this cost-benefit information to show that one potential corridor between two large forest patches had net benefits that were three times greater than two otherwise similar alternatives. Spatial cost-benefit analysis can powerfully inform conservation planning, even though the availability of relevant data may be limited, as was the case in our study area. It can help us understand the synergies between biodiversity conservation and economic development when the two are indeed aligned and to clearly understand the trade-offs when they are not.

AB Spatially explicit population data can play an important role in studies on environment and sustainability. Several gridded datasets on the present population exist, but global data on future populations are largely lacking. This paper presents a dataset covering three global population forecasts for the period 1990-2100 at 0.5-degrees resolution. The basis for these forecasts is the SRES scenarios developed for the IPCC climate-modeling framework. In addition, a gridded dataset of urban and rural populations for the period 1990-2050 is presented. To illustrate how the datasets can be used, future changes in population density and urbanization were analyzed for some of the world's major river basins. This analysis shows that the population density in the Ganges basin, which is already very high, is likely to increase considerably. The highest future increase rates were found in some African and Middle-Eastern basins. The population dataset for 2015 was compared with one previously published gridded dataset. The comparison shows some differences in population density, mainly in small, highly urbanized coastal river basins, while for large basins, the two datasets agree fairly well. We hope that the datasets here presented will prove to be a useful resource also for other researchers of global environmental change and sustainable development.

AB The present paper presents the approach, results and outcome of an innovative piece of action research amongst professionals (health and non-health) and the public (women and young people from low-income families in one of the deprived areas of Birmingham, UK). A cooperative inquiry approach was used and data were collected on concerns about health of professionals (n 15) and the public (n 19), as well as dietary practices, smoking pattern and access to healthy foods amongst the public (n 49). The methods of data collection were: desk research; observation; semi-structured individual and focus-group interviews; structured individual interviews. The findings highlight diverse views and expectations about health amongst the public and the professionals, and suggest the existence of tensions between the partnership and the ownership of inter-agency collaboration. It argues the importance of having a shared vision amongst health and non-health professionals regarding health strategy and the way forward for working together to promote the public's health. It recommends that by using the tenet of action research, and adapting a cooperative inquiry approach, members of a partnership project could learn through reflection on action and achieve personal development and social action.

AB A brief glance through the national papers and medical press shows the depth of concern with the cost of delivering high quality, free at the point of access healthcare to the population. However, at a time of increasingly greater demands being placed on public health systems across the globe, the question of how we can make health and healthcare both accessible to everyone and sustainable in the long term is being posed. In this paper we provide an insight into how England is responding to these challenges. (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The Royal Institute of Public Health.

AB This article describes the process of developing targeted occupational health services for the health care workers in a women's hospital in Kabul, Afghanistan, as part of a larger project to establish an obstetrics and gynecology residency training program at the facility. The goal was to create a feasible and sustainable program to: (1) address basic health care needs impacting the ability of these Afghan health care workers to optimize learning opportunities; (2) decrease absenteeism due to illness; (3) decrease the likelihood of infectious disease transmission among staff, from staff to patients, and from patients to staff; (4) foster belief that a healthy and safe working environment is a basic right; (5) begin to collect preliminary health status indicators on health care workers in this employee population; and (6) serve as an adaptable program to expand to other Afghan health care workers.

AB The introduction of the dimension of green chemistry into the assessment of analytical methods should be a natural development trend in chemistry and should coincide with its general policy. Some of the principles of green chemistry-such as prevention of waste generation; safer solvents and auxiliaries; design for energy efficiency; safer chemistry to minimize the potential of chemical accidents; development of instrumental methods-are directly related to analytical chemistry.
   Analytical chemistry is considered to be a small-scale activity, but this is not always true in the case of controlling and monitoring laboratories whose number of runs performed is hi-h. This makes an analytical laboratory comparable with the fine chemicals or pharmaceutical industry. The use of instrumental methods instead of wet chemistry, automation, and minimization is a new trend in analytical chemistry, making this branch of chemistry more sustainable.
   In this study, widespread separation methods are considered and an attempt is made to characterize them against the above-mentioned principles. Special attention is given to capillary electrophoresis (CE), which provides a very good opportunity to improve analytical chemistry by replacing many chromatographic methods that consume large volumes of solvents. The choice of different solvents and micronization in analytical chemistry is also discussed.

ID TECHNICAL REPORT; EXPOSURE
AB Increasingly, chemists are faced with legislation requiring assessment of hazard and risk associated with the production, use, and disposal of chemicals. In addition, the general public are concerned about the dangers that they hear may result from the widespread use of chemicals. They look to the chemist for explanations and assume that chemists understand such matters. When they discover that chemists are often ignorant of the potential of chemicals to cause harm, their confidence in the profession is lost and chemophobia may result. In 1993, IUPAC agreed on a joint project between the Toxicology Commission and the Committee on Teaching of Chemistry to address the issue of the teaching of toxicology in the chemistry curriculum. Part of the project was a distance learning program, which is available through the Internet and on CD. The program currently consists of seven modules, one of which deals specifically with environmental toxicology. The contents of each unit will be explained as each has some input into environmental matters and green/sustainable chemistry. The program is aimed at teacher and student alike, and each module has self-assessment exercises at the end of the module. Additionally, there is material on health and safety, ethical matters, and a case study of the use of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT).

AB Fire and grazing are interactive disturbance processes that are important to the structure and function of grassland ecosystems. Studies of nitrogen (N) availability report different effects following grazing and fire. However, these studies have largely neglected the spatially controlled interaction between fire and grazing. The objective of our work was to evaluate an application of the fire-grazing interaction model on N availability in a tallgrass prairie. We compared patches within a shifting mosaic landscape where each patch varied in time since focal disturbance (fire and intense grazing disturbance). We also evaluated N availability on a burned and grazed landscape where fires and moderate grazing occurred annually and uniformly across the entire landscape. These treatments were both burned and grazed where the only difference was spatial and temporal variability in fire application and grazing disturbance. Samples were collected from upland sites in May of 2003 and 2004. Total soil inorganic N (NH4+-N + NO3--N) and a growth chamber experiment with hard red winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv. Jagger) were used to evaluate potential N availability. Our study produced patterns of N availability that are more similar to studies of grazing lawns where N availability is enhanced by focal grazing than from studies of fire without grazing. Overall, our study demonstrates that fire and grazing are interactive. Unburned patches have minimal grazing pressure and low N availability. Fire-grazing interaction may provide a management alternative that enables sustainable livestock production, through increased carrying capacity in focally disturbed patches, concomitant with biological diversity in tallgrass prairie.

AB Kutubdia is one of the coastal islands in Bangladesh. The wind speed data at the wind monitoring station of Bangladesh Meteorological Department (BMD), Kutubdia, located in a built-up area, appears to be low, but at another location, near the seashore, Bangladesh Centre for Advanced Studies (BCAS) finds that the wind energy availability should be reasonably high. Considering the surface roughness, obstacle condition and terrain information of the island, a micro-scale prediction has been done using (100 x 100 m(2)) grid cells in the Wind Atlas Analysis and Application Program (WAsP) to develop monthly and annual wind atlas and also a wind resource map which shows that at 50 m height, the annual wind speed over Kutubdia coast varies from 5.1 to 5.8 m/s. Southern and Eastern sides of Kutubdia appear to be promising for wind electricity generation using large turbines where wind power density at a height of 50 m or higher is found to be above 200 W/m(2) annually over the year September 1996 to August 1997. It is found that at 30 m height, the coast side of Kutubdia should be sustainable for small turbines. (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

DE smoot; variable measures; percent of revenue ftom new products; percent

AB Because innovation can be achieved in many ways, measuring innovativeness is difficult to do well with a single measure. One effective approach is to pair a "fixed" with a "variable" measure, that is, Revenue from New Products with Revenue from New Platforms. The former reveals much about the overall rate of change and the latter about the quality Of "newness" of the shift in revenue. The former focuses on product and the latter on any kind of relevant platform that leads to advantage through innovation: product, technology, manufacturing, operational, or business. By considering the accounting-based new product measure in concert with the more flexible measure of new platforms, a company can explore meaningfully the quality of its innovation and how sustainable is its innovativeness.

ID POLITICAL-ECONOMY
AB This paper investigates the political and economic determinants of successful fiscal adjustment in 25 emerging market economies from 1980 to 2001. The results show that large and back-loaded fiscal adjustments have the highest likelihood of success. Fiscal consolidations based on expenditure cuts increase the probability of approaching and achieving fiscal sustainability but are insufficient to maintain it unless accompanied by revenue reforms. Adjustment episodes launched in countries where governments enjoy a parliamentary majority and do not face imminent elections, are found to be more successful. Fiscal consolidations undertaken under IMF-supported programs also have a higher probability of success.

AB Produced water management has become one of the key factors to sustainable development of natural gas/oil resources. The substantial quantities of saline water present intractable environmental threats and also increase oil/gas production costs through produced water disposal such as deep well reinjection. Developing high-efficient and flexible treatment systems that can be operated at low costs is of high interests for producers and state regulators. Beneficial use of produced water could represent a new water resource especially for areas with inadequate existing supplies. Furthermore, some produced waters generated are also characterized by elevated concentrations of recoverable constituents, for example iodide. Recovering iodide from brine could offer additional benefits besides providing methane gas, reusing produced water, or reducing brine disposal volume.
   The advent of ultra-low pressure reverse osmosis (ULPRO) membranes and nanofiltration (NF) membranes with high desalting degree might offer a viable option for produced water treatment because these membranes can be as effective as reverse osmosis (RO) in removing certain solutes from water while requiring considerably less feed pressure resulting in lower operating costs. The objectives of this research were to investigate the viability of ULPRO and NF membranes as potential techniques to treat produced water by meeting water quality standards and concentrating iodide in the brine. The produced water extracted from sandstone aquifer in Eastern Montana was characterized as brackish groundwater of sodium chloride type with total dissolved solids (TDS) concentration of 5300 mg/L, absence of hydrocarbons, and average iodide concentrations of 55 mg/L. The produced water exhibited a very high potential to membrane fouling indicated by silt density index (SDI) measurements due to the presence of small particles and inorganic constituents.
   The studied candidate membranes included one RO membrane (TFC-HR, Koch Membrane Systems), three ULPRO membranes XLE (Dow/Filmtec), TFC-ULP (Koch) and TMG-10 (Toray America), and three NF membranes NF-90 (Dow/Filmtec), TFC-S (Koch), and ESNA (Hydranautics). Bench-scale cross-flow flat sheet test units were employed to assess the candidate membranes using the produced water with focus on fouling potential, iodide recovery, and general salt rejection. The degree of flux decline was found to be dependent upon the combination of permeate drag force and physico-chemical properties of the membranes. The membranes with higher permeability generally displayed faster initial flux decline. In addition, hydrophobic and rough membranes exhibited a higher flux decline and lower chemical cleaning efficiency than smooth and/or hydrophilic membranes. Flux decline experiments, in situ microscopic techniques, analysis of elemental composition and functional groups revealed that the pretreatment including microfiltration, pH adjustment and addition of antiscalants could alleviate membrane fouling significantly. Chemical cleaning using caustic and anionic surfactant solutions restored membrane permeability more efficiently than hydraulic cleaning or using acids and metal chelating agents. This study showed that TFC-ULP, TMG-10, and NF-90 membranes exhibited competitive efficiency regarding salt rejection, iodide recovery and adjusted specific flux as compared to a conventional RO membrane.

AB In the Ethiopian highlands, large-scale stone bund building programs are implemented to curb severe soil erosion. Development of soil fertility gradients is often mentioned as the major drawback of stone bund implementation, as it would result in a dramatic lowering of crop yield. Therefore, the objectives of this study are to assess soil fertility gradients on progressive terraces and their influence on crop yield, in order to evaluate the long-term sustainability of stone bunds in the Ethiopian Highlands.
   The study was performed near Hagere Selam, Tigray and comprises (i) measurement Of P(av), N(tot) and C(org) along the slope on 20 representative plots and (ii) crop response measurement on 143 plots. Results indicate that levels Of P(av), N(tot) and C(org) in the plough layer are highly variable between plots and mainly determined by small-scale soil and environmental features, plot history and management. After correcting for this "plot effect" a significant relationship (p < 0.01) was found between the position in the plot relative to the stone bund and levels Of P(av) and N(tot), which are higher near the lower stone bund, especially on limestone parent material. For C(org) and on basalt-derived soils in general no significant relationship was found. Although soil fertility gradients are present, they are not problematic and can be compensated by adapted soil management. Only in areas where a Calcaric or Calcic horizon is present at shallow depth, care should be taken. Crop Yields increased by 7% compared to the situation without stone bunds, if a land occupation of 8% by the structures is accounted for. Yield increased from 632 to 683 kg ha(-1) for cereals, from 501 to 556 kg ha(-1) (11%) for Eragrostis tef and from 335 to 351 kg ha(-1) for Cicer arietinum.
   No negative effects reducing stone-bund sustainability were found in this study. Soil erosion on the other hand, poses a major threat to agricultural productivity. Stone bund implementation therefore is of vital importance in fighting desertification and establishing sustainable agriculture in the Ethiopian highlands. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Microbial-based indicators of soil quality are believed to be more dynamic than those based on physical and chemical properties. Recent developments in molecular biology based techniques have led to rapid and reliable tools to characterize microbial community structures. We determined the effects of conventional and no-tillage in cropping systems with and without cover crops on bacterial community structure, total organic carbon (TOC) and soil aggregation. Tillage and rotation did not affect TOC from bulk soil. However, TOC was greater in the largest aggregate size class (7.98-19 mm), and had greater mean-weight diameter under no-tillage than under conventional tillage in the 0-5 cm soil layer. Soil bacterial community structure, based on denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of polymerase chain reaction amplified DNA (PCR/DGGE) using two different genes as biomarkers, 16S rRNA and rpoB genes, indicated different populations in response to cultivation, tillage and depth, but not due to cover cropping. Soil bacterial community structure and meanweight diameter of soil aggregates indicated alterations in soil conditions due to tillage system. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This article illustrates the implementation of a school reform policy for educating young children in one south eastern state in the US, a reform known as the non-graded primary program. The reform is examined through the lens of Sabatier and Mazmanian's [(1981). The implementation of public policy: A framework for analysis. In D.A. Mazmanian, & P.A. Sabatier (Eds.), Effective policy implementation (pp. 3-36). Lexington, MA: Lexington Books] framework for policy implementation and Hashweh's [(2003). Teacher accommodative change. Teaching and Teacher Education, 19, 421-434] model of accommodative change which proposes to explain how individual teachers change their practices. The article features four related studies of teacher change and the attitudes of teachers, administrators, and community members. The community, politics, and media had an impact on the sustainability of the change, and subsequently, after 10 years, many teachers had reverted to old practices. Teachers who made the most progressive changes were those whose beliefs were philosophically aligned with the theory of the policy, had excellent and continued professional development, and had supportive leadership.

AB The incentives for using biodiesel as renewable fuel and the difficulties associated with its production are outlined. The pros and cons of manufacturing biodiesel via fatty acid esterification using solid acid catalysts are investigated. Finding a suitable catalyst that is active, selective, and stable under the process conditions is the major challenge. The most promising candidates were found to be the sulfated metal oxides that can be used to develop a sustainable esterification process based on catalytic reactive distillation.

AB As the new millennium progresses, TQM is expected to mature into a sustainability phase to support a universal business strategy. Its critical success factors will vary in order to accommodate changes in the environment where the firms operate. Despite the fact that TQM initiatives have been recognised by many organisations as capable of transforming the quality culture and producing competitiveness, new initiatives or their improved versions are being suggested to retain TQM vigour and its sustainability. This has called for a continuous discourse and the development of a framework for sustaining TQM, which is the object of this paper. The paper first traces the development of the concept of sustainability, leading to the conception of sustainable TQM. A framework of proposed research is presented drawing from the literature on quality orientation, performance measurement, change management, and related organisational theories. Strategies for effectively sustaining TQM implementation are highlighted. A set of theoretical enablers and inhibitors for sustaining TQM are discussed, and a research model is proposed. From the model, various scenarios are constructed, and research propositions are deduced. Finally, a methodology for an empirical stage of research is offered.

AB This article addresses the potential for reducing international work-related air travelling through the use of information and communication technologies such as videoconferences and e-learning in knowledge companies. It looks at the potential for reducing travel related to such things as meetings and teaching. In the absence of regulations, however, we do not find potential for reducing the number of trips of this type because they do not facilitate face-to-face contacts. Therefore the conclusion is, that policy and planning have to look for other options for pursuing 'sustainable mobility' policies in the future. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Indoor air-borne loads of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are usually significantly higher than those outdoors, and chronic exposures can cause health problems. Our previous laboratory studies have shown that the potted-plant microcosm, induced by an initial dose, can eliminate high air-borne VOC concentrations, the primary removal agents being potting-mix microorganisms, selected and maintained in the plant/root-zone microcosm. Our office field-study, reported in the preceding paper, showed that, when total VOC (TVOC) loads in reference offices (0 plants) rose above about 100 ppb, levels were generally reduced by up to 75% (to < 100 ppb) in offices with any one of three planting regimes. The results indicate the induction of the VOC removal mechanism at TVOC levels above a threshold of about 100 ppb. The aims of this laboratory dose-response study were to explore and analyse this response. Over from 5 to 9 days, doses of 0.2, 1.0, 10 and 100 ppm toluene and m-xylene were applied and replenished, singly and as mixtures, to potted-plants of the same two species used in the office study. The results confirmed the induction of the VOC removal response at the lowest test dosage, i.e in the middle of the TVOC range found in the offices, and showed that, with subsequent dosage increments, further stepwise induction occurred, with rate increases of several orders of magnitude. At each dosage, with induction, VOC concentrations could be reduced to below GC detection limits (< 20 ppb) within 24 h. A synergistic interaction was found with the binary mixtures, toluene accelerating m-xylene removal, at least at lower dosages. The results of these two studies together demonstrate that the potted-plant microcosm can provide an effective, self-regulating, sustainable bioremediation or phytoremediation system for VOC pollution in indoor air.

AB Resistance to herbicides in the most important weeds threatens the sustainability of California rice. Weed-competitive rice cultivars could be a low-cost and safe non-chemical addition to an integrated weed management program. Trade-offs between competitiveness and productivity and inconsistent trait expression under weedy and weed-free conditions could complicate the breeding of competitive rice cultivars. A 2-year competition experiment was conducted in the greenhouse involving eight rice cultivars and two weed competition regimes (presence or absence of late watergrass) to examine the effects of rice weed-suppressive ability and tolerance to weed competition (weed tolerance) on rice yield. Competition reduced average rice yield from 32 to 48%, and watergrass biomass from 44 to 77%. Pat enhancing rice weed-suppressive ability and weed tolerance while minimizing possible productivity trade-offs should promote early (12 d after seeding) growth and light-capture traits followed by moderate growth rates before heading and a vigorous grain filling period. Crop growth rate (CGR) after heading was a relevant determiriant of yield (direct path: 0.82, P < 0.01) and correlated (r = 0.30, P < 0.01) with weed tolerance. Late biomass accumulation was negatively correlated with harvest index and CGR during ripening (r = -0.46, P < 0.01); thus, late-season competitiveness can lower productivity. Rice traits conferring competitiveness were correlated across weed competition regimes (r = 0.36-0.81, P < 0.01). However, significant cultivar-by-competition and cultivar-by-year interactions suggest that selection efficiency would be greater when traits are identified under competition and in different environments. This study relates to the phenotypic expression of traits for competitiveness. Breeding competitive cultivars will require additional knowledge on trait heritability, genetic correlations with competitiveness, and on the effects of the environment upon gene expression.

TI Will it stay or will it go? Federalism and the sustainability of Belgium
SO WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS
LA English
DT Article
AB This article provides an overview of the federalisation of Belgium. It first discusses why Belgium acquired a federal character when the politics of the centre already recognised the multilingual character of the Belgian state. Subsequently the authors discuss the specificities of the Belgian federal system when it is placed in a comparative perspective. The presence of two different types of regions - Regions and Communities - the steering capacity of a small group of political elites reluctant to give up political control, the presence of institutional asymmetries, the initially dual nature of dividing competencies and the slow development of intergovernmental relations are highlighted as specific features of Belgian federalism. In the final section, the authors assess the assets and liabilities of federalism from the viewpoint of institutional stability. They argue that while Belgian federalism contains significant institutional shock absorbers and issues of common interest, the further unravelling of the centre in a confederal direction is more likely.

AB Currently over 14.6 million ha of land at an annual cost of US$1.76 billion are enrolled in the Conservation Reserve Program (CPP). The habitat benefits of CRP frequently are lauded, but documentation that wildlife is responding as hoped is urgently needed. We evaluated plant and breeding bird responses to 92.4 ha of CPP grasslands at China Farms in northeastern Maryland, USA. In 1999 we seeded 12 contiguous CRP fields with 5 mixtures of warm-season grasses representing various growth-form heights in a replicated experimental design, and used mowing and topical herbicide applications to control noxious weeds and facilitate stand establishment. In 6 years cumulative plant species richness increased to 261, 105 of which were species exotic to the region. During the third growing season, we initiated a schedule of prescribed burning on a 3-year rotation to remove accumulated litter and to retard woody succession, and in 2003 we added additional management to control aggressive plant species. Several at-risk bird species colonized the restored grasslands in the first year and established sustainable breeding populations. We implemented a comprehensive observation and banding program, which included mapping male territories for selected bird species and recording nest locations. We marked 1,985 grasshopper sparrows (Ammodramus savannarum; GRSPs) in 7 years. Breeding GRSP populations ranged annually from 70 to 90 socially monogamous pairs with an additional 40 non-territorial males. Annual return rates in the last 5 years were 57% for adult males, 41% for adult females, and 12% for hatch-year individuals. Adults and young birds exhibited high site fidelity, but overgrown fields left unburned for 2-3 years were unpopulated by GRSPs but attracted several shrub-land bird species. Habitat preference for territories was influenced more by vegetation structure than by plant species composition. We recommend the management of grasslands restored for birds include spatial and temporal rotation of prescribed fire and herbicide applications to sustain vegetation physical structure rather than species composition.

TI The role of farm policy in achieving large-scale conservation: Bobwhite
   and buffers
SO WILDLIFE SOCIETY BULLETIN

   policy; habitat buffers for upland birds; northern bobwhite; Northern
   Bobwhite Conservation Initiative
ID FIELD BORDERS; BIRDS
AB The Farm Bill provides a policy vehicle for implementing conservation programs with the potential to alter land use on a large spatial scale. The conservation payments under the Farm Bill dwarf the collective investment of the North American Wetlands Conservation Act, Endangered Species Act, Pittman-Robertson Act, and Conservation and Reinvestment Act. However, the ecological value of past policy has varied by program, practice, region, and wildlife species, resulting in a broad array of wildlife habitat and population effects ranging from positive to negative. We argue the conservation provisions of the Farm Bill can produce more consistent positive wildlife habitat benefits when policy (program statutes, rules, practices, and practice standards) is developed in the context of explicit goals identified as part of large-scale conservation initiatives. For example, initiatives like the North American Waterfowl Management Plan, Partners in Flight, and the Northern Bobwhite Conservation Initiative (NBCI) set science-based goals and objectives to facilitate wildlife species population recovery and sustainability at the landscape scale. We contend that the best ecological and societal cost/benefit ratio is achieved when Farm Bill conservation programs and practices are developed to address these specific habitat goals. We present a case study illustrating how a Conservation Reserve Program option (Conservation Practice 33-Habitat Buffers for Upland Birds) specifically addresses NBCI goals and objectives. We discuss the successes, failures, and lessons learned by NCBI in policy formulation, practice development, programmatic delivery, and evaluation.

TI The challenges of affirmative action in Tanzanian higher education
   institutions: A case study of the University of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania
SO WOMENS STUDIES INTERNATIONAL FORUM
LA English
DT Article
AB This article discusses affirmative action programmes introduced and designed to increase female students' enrolment at the University of Dar es Salaam. The assessment of the interventions is made within the context and perceptions of their implementation. A key finding of this study is that affirmative action programmes have succeeded in increasing female enrolment generally and in traditionally male-dominated specializations such as Engineering, Medicine, Chemistry, Physics and Mathematics specifically. For example, as a result of affirmative action female enrolment in the Faculty of Science rose from 16% in 1996 to 27% in 2003/2004 and from 7% in 1996 to 13% in 2003/04 in the Engineering Faculty. However, as this article shows, there is much more to gender equity than just numbers. Qualitative factors such as participation in academic life as students or staff within and outside the classroom, the living environment, pedagogy and institutional micro-politics continue to pose challenges for gender equity and equality. Limitations in programme scale, infrastructure and resources also raise important questions regarding the sustainability of these affirmative action programmes. Therefore, while affirmative action can be seen as positive efforts to offset a historical imbalance, it still is confronted with and opens up new debates on privilege and discrimination amidst concerns with sustainability in a third world context.

TI Gender mainstreaming in the university context: Prospects and challenges
   at Makerere University, Uganda
SO WOMENS STUDIES INTERNATIONAL FORUM
LA English
DT Article
AB This article focuses on gender mainstreaming, a relatively recent strategy to bridge gender gaps in diverse aspects of university life. It analyses gender mainstreaming, in relation to systems, structures, and processes, as well as the varied actors involved in this process. It assesses the parameters within which the strategy can be applied. The influence of gender mainstreaming in the wider university community and within the academic and administrative programmes is assessed.
   The experience of Makerere University in Uganda is the basis for the analysis. The article draws on a wider research project focusing on gender equity in higher education in Uganda with special attention on issues of access, curriculum and staff development. The research involved extensive documentary reviews. Interviews with key selected stakeholders, representative of students, academic and administrative staff and top-decision makers and implementers were also conducted.
   The Makerere University gender mainstreaming model is unique in its combination of both academic and institutional interventions - a full-fledged vibrant academic Department of Women and Gender Studies and a Gender Mainstreaming Division strengthens the Gender Mainstreaming Programme (GMP). The Programme has the official recognition of the highest governing organ of the University (the Council) and has clear and recognized tentacles in lower organs of the University. A large number of both male staff and students at various levels are involved.
   The article suggests that the application of a gender mainstreaming strategy is possible, though complex. The case study institution analysed shows some progress but there are still many challenges relating to structural issues, sustainability, policy formulation, the commitment of actors involved, and the whole aspect of attitudinal change both at individual level and collectively for the institution. Positive aspects and the achievements of the intervention are analysed. (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper explores why post-reform decentralization in China has failed to bring about environmental sustainability, using a case study from Uxin banner in Inner Mongolia. The local government has promoted intensive grassland improvement in its political, economic, and environmental policies under the umbrella of "ecological construction," a term used to describe the enhancement of vegetation cover on this and terrain. The government's aggressive approach to ecological construction, however, is incongruent with the ecology of the Inner Mongolian drylands. Consequently, although beneficial to short-term economic growth, "ecological construction" has led to unintended grassland degradation, thus undermining environmental sustainability.

   Mexico
SO WORLD DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article

AB Decentralized governance of water resources is a centerpiece of Mexico's neoliberal reform strategy. We analyze decentralization based on urban/rural case studies in distinct geographical regions to ascertain whether it is linked to more efficient water management or sustainable use of water resources, and to examine its development implications. We assess whether or not private sector management is related to a more efficient, sustainable, and accountable management of water variety of municipal and private management arrangement in four urban areas. We find that it has not resulted in efficiency or sustainability gains. For agricultural water management, irrigation districts in two case studies benefited from the more democratic participatory management by water users under Mexico's "transference" strategy, but did not result in greater equity, efficiency or sustainability of water use. We argue that decentralization in the Mexican water sector is context specific, and marked by limited benefits. Privatization is less an instrument aimed at improving efficiency than a channel for preferred treatment for capital accumulation by private entities as well as a legitimized way for the state to transfer the burden of water management to non-state institutions. The creation of new forms of water institutions requires not the retrenchment of the state but rather its involvement to ensure accountability, transparency, equity, and sustainability.

AB Removal of phosphorus (P) by Ceratophyllum demersum L. and associated epiphytic periphyton was quantified by measuring the disappearance of soluble reactive P (SRP) from microcosms during 1-h in situ incubations conducted over a 1-year period. Initial P concentrations in these incubations ranged from 30 to >10,000 mu g P L-1. Phosphorus removal was proportional to initial P concentrations and was weakly correlated with solar irradiance and water temperature. Removal rates (0.6-32.8 mg p m(-2) d(-1)) and k(v) coefficients (0.68-1.93 h(-1)) from experiments run at low initial P concentrations (up to 200 mu g P L-1) were comparable to results reported for other macrophytes. Removal rates from experiments run at the highest (>10,000 mu g P L-1) initial P concentrations (5300 and 11,100 mg p m(-2) d(-1)) most likely represented luxury nutrient consumption and were not thought to be sustainable long term. We were unable to determine a V-max for P removal, suggesting that the nutrient-storage capability of the C. demersum/periphyton complex was not saturated during our short-term incubations. Based on N:P molar ratios, the marsh was P limited, while the C. demersum/periphyton complex was either N limited or in balance for N and P throughout this study. However, despite its tissue stoichiometry, the C. demersum/periphyton complex always exhibited an affinity for P. It appeared that the biochemical mechanisms, which mediate P removal, at least on a short-term basis, were more influenced by increases in ambient P levels than by tissue nutrient stoichiometry.

AB Stocks of products in use are the pivotal engines that drive anthropogenic metal cycles: They support the lives of people by providing services to them; they are sources for future secondary resources (scrap); and demand for in-use stocks generates demand for metals. Despite their great importance and their impacts on other parts of the metal cycles and the environment, the study of in-use stocks has heretofore been widely neglected. Here we investigate anthropogenic and geogenic iron stocks in the United States (U.S.) by analyzing the iron cycle over the period 1900-2004. Our results show the following. (J) Over the last century, the U.S. iron stock in use increased to 3,200 Tg (million metric tons), which is the same order of magnitude as the remaining U.S. iron stock in identified ores. On a global scale, anthropogenic iron stocks are less significant compared with natural ores, but their relative importance is increasing. (h) With a perfect recycling system, the U.S. could substitute scrap utilization for domestic mining. (fit) The per-capita in-use iron stock reached saturation at 11-12 metric tons in approximate to 1980. This last finding, if applicable to other economies as well, could allow a significant improvement of long-term forecasting of steel demand and scrap availability in emerging market economies and therefore has major implications for resource sustainability, recycling technology, and industrial and governmental policy.

AB The Pajaro River, central coastal California, consistently loses 0.2-0.4 m(3)/s of discharge along an 11.42-km experimental reach late in the water year, when discharge is <= 4.5 m(3)/s. Channel toss occurs throughout this reach, but is greatest in magnitude near the bottom of the reach. Water isotopic data and other observations suggest that channel loss results mainly from streambed seepage, as opposed to evapotranspiration. If it occurs throughout the year, the channel loss along this short stream reach could contribute 6-13 x 10(6) m(3) Of annual aquifer recharge, or similar to 20-40% of current sustainable basin yield. We performed a series of tracer injections along this reach to determine if hydrologic exchange occurs within this strongly-losing stream. We found that during periods of high channel loss, there were also comparable storage exchange fluxes and lateral inflow of tracer-free water. Within upper and lower parts of the experimental reach, storage exchange fluxes are about 10 times greater than lateral inflow. The former are associated with the movement of water between the main channel and surface or subsurface storage zones. In this system, it is likely that the tatter are primarily associated with spatially- or temporally-long subsurface flow paths within the shallow streambed, as opposed to inflow of ground water from deeper in the basin. Along both upper and lower parts of the experimental reach, lateral inflow tends to increase as channel discharge decreases. In contrast, storage exchange fluxes increase with decreasing discharge along the upper parts of the reach, but decrease with decreasing discharge along the Lower parts. Gauging and tracer test results suggest that subsurface storage exchange and loss may occur simultaneously, and that the lateral inflow of tracer-free water can be caused by long-scale subsurface flow as well as ground water making its first appearance in the channel.

AB Ibuprofen (IBU) loaded polyvinyl alcohol-based hydrogel beads (IBU-BB) were designed to alleviate side effects such as inflammation and pain following uterine artery embolization for the treatment of leiomyomata. The present in vitro and in vivo study examines whether IBU-BB provide a sustained-release of the drug. In vitro release studies of IBU from IBU-BB (10, 50, 100 mg/mL), IBU solution (PEDEA (R)) and IBU powder were compared using the T apparatus and the beaker method. The pharmacokinetic profile of IBU release was examined in vivo, following sheep uterine artery embolization with 100 mg/mL IBU-BB or after intra-arterial injection of IBU solution.
   IBU-BB can deliver high concentrations of the drug over time. The in vitro release from IBU-BB was markedly slower compared to IBU solution. Increasing the concentration of loaded IBU from 10 to 100 mg/mL decreased the rate of release. IBU release from the T apparatus was slower than the release in the beaker. In vivo, the release of the drug was progressive, without the early peak observed with IBU solution. A high level of correlation was obtained between in vivo and in vitro (T apparatus) results. Theoretically, IBU-BB could sustainably release high concentrations of IBU at the site of the uterine fibroids, which makes it a promising approach for the control of post-embolization pain.

AB Anodization of Ti in acidified fluoride solution results in an ordered nanotubular titanium oxide surface. In this study, vertically oriented arrays of TiO2 nanotubes were prepared by incorporating nitrate and phosphate species during the anodization process. These nanotubes were annealed at 650 degrees C in a carbonaceous atmosphere using a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) furnace for a brief period. The carbon-modified nanotubular TiO2 produced a photo-current density of more than 2.75 mA cm(-2) at 0.2 V-Ag/(AgCl) under solar light illumination. This photo-current density corresponds to a hydrogen evolution rate of about 111 h(-1) using a photo-anode of 1 m(2) area. The enhanced hydrogen evolution behavior of carbon-modified nanotubular TiO2 is highly reproducible and sustainable for long duration. Annealed (at 350 degrees C in nitrogen atmosphere) TiO2 nanotubes showed improved photo-activity as compared to the as-anodized or thermally oxidized TiO2 photo-anodes. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

TI Life cycle assessment of Finnish cultivated rainbow trout
SO BOREAL ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID ASSESSMENT LCA
AB Rainbow trout is economically the most important cultivated fish in Finland. In this study, new knowledge on the energy consumption, emissions and environmental impacts caused by the production of rainbow trout in Finland was generated. Methodologically the work was based on life cycle assessment (LCA) beginning from the extraction of raw materials and ending with the delivery of gutted fish to the retailers or for further processing. The environmental performances of production methods with different feeds, feed coefficients and technical emission reduction measures were assessed. The environmental impact assessment revealed that atmospheric emissions - originating mainly from the feed raw material production, feed manufacturing and transportation - make only a minor contribution to the total environmental impacts caused by the production of rainbow trout in Finland. Phosphorus and nitrogen emissions from fish farms to waters are the most significant emissions from the point of view of the total environmental impacts. By using new, environmentally friendly feeds with increased feed efficiency it is possible to decrease the nitrogen and phosphorus loads significantly. Technical measures to decrease nutrient emissions to the waters reduce the phosphorus load but have only a minor effect on nitrogen. Energy consumption and the use of renewable energy sources proved to be one of the key indicators for developing more sustainable aquacultural practices in Finland, although the major share of energy consumption associated with the production of rainbow trout takes place outside Finland.

AB Indian agriculture has been successful in increasing foodgrains production in the past, guided by the goals of 'self-sufficiency' in the country. The mission of increasing foodgrains production somehow stands achieved, however, accompanied by series of problems related to the environment and natural resources. We have reached a situation where we must look for new directions, learning from our past. Conservation agriculture can be seen as a new way forward for conserving resources and enhancing productivity to achieve the goals of sustainable agriculture, which demands a strong knowledge base and a combination of institutional and technological innovations.

AB Biomass burning from forest regions and agriculture crop residues can emit substantial amounts of particulate matter and other pollutants into the atmosphere. An inventory of forest, grassland and agricultural burning is important for studies related to global change. This study provides an account of the agriculture crop residue burning in Punjab during wheat and rice crop growing periods. Indian Remote Sensing Satellite (IRS-P6) Advanced Wide Field Sensor (AWiFS) data during May and October 2005 have been analysed for estimating the extent of burnt areas and thereby greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from crop residue burning. Emission factors available in the literature were integrated with satellite remote sensing data for estimating the emissions. Results suggested that emissions from wheat crop residues in Punjab are relatively low compared to those from paddy fields. It is inferred that incorporation of agricultural residues into the soil in rice-wheat system is highly sustainable and eco-friendly, rather than burning the crop residues. The potential of satellite remote sensing datasets for burnt area estimation and GHG emissions, is also demonstrated in the study.

DT Article
ID DESIGN; REUSE
AB Water network synthesis has been employed to conserve water resources and reduce freshwater costs for the sake of sustainable development. However, the previous economic evaluations of water network systems did not comprehensively include all of the tradeoffs incurred in water network synthesis. The objective of this work was to evaluate the economic feasibility of a water network system using the net present value (NPV) method and estimate the principal cost and benefit contributors to its NPV. The procedure used for the economic evaluation consisted of water network synthesis, water system design, the estimation of the incremental costs and benefits, and the application of the NPV method. A total of 10 water-using operations in the steel and iron industry suffering from the shortage of water were used to evaluate the profitability of a water network system. The water network system was optimized by minimizing the freshwater consumption rates through nonlinear mathematical programming. This water network system was specifically designed, and its incremental costs and benefits were estimated on the basis of the conventional water system. The principal cost contributor to the NPV was the piping cost in the construction stage, while the principal benefit contributor to the NPV was industrial water used in the operations and maintenance stage. The results of the NPV method including all of the tradeoffs showed that the water network system was more economical than the conventional water system, with reduced industrial water consumption and wastewater generation rates. This work was expected to activate the implementation of water network systems by demonstrating the high profitability and contribute to the simple generation of a NPV-maximized water network system by estimating the principal cost and benefit contributors to the NPV used for the streamlined objective function of mathematical formulation.

AB Mechanistic studies on steam reforming of acetic acid over Pt/ZrO2 catalysts were performed as extension of our previous work [K. Takanabe, K. Aika, K. Seshan, L. Lefferts, J. Catal. 227 (2004) 101]. An overall picture of the bifunctional mechanism is established for steam reforming of acetic acid, where both Pt and ZrO2 participate in the reaction. On Pt, bond breaking of acetic acid proceeds to form H-2, CO, CH4, and CO2 into gas phase, and to form the carbonaceous residue (most probably CHx species), which can block Pt surface. Both pulse experiments as well as in situ IR data demonstrate that H2O can be activated on ZrO2 to create supplementary surface hydroxyl groups, which react to gasify the residue on Pt to give chiefly steam-reforming/water-gas shift products (H-2, CO2), and thus the catalytic cycles continue. Importance of the Pt-ZrO2 boundary sites is confirmed by the fact that the removal of the carbonaceous residue situated at the boundary sites results in catalyst regeneration. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

AB Biological hydrogen production from anaerobic waste fermentation possesses potential benefits in simultaneously reducing organic wastes and generating sustainable energy sources. Three kinetic-based steady-state models for anaerobic fermentation of multiple substrates, including glucose and peptone, were evaluated. Experimental results obtained from a continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) were primarily used for model evaluation. The dual-substrate steady-state model developed and the associated kinetic parameters estimated in this study successfully described the anaerobic growth of hydrogen-producing bacteria. The model was able to capture the general trends of consumption of substrates and accumulation of products, including formate, acetate, butyrate, and hydrogen, at dilution rates (D) between 0.06 and 0.69/h. According to the model, the adverse effects of endogeneous and peptone metabolism on net hydrogen production can be minimized by increasing D. For the operational conditions of D > 0.69/h, however, substantial washout of hydrogen-producing bacteria from the CSTR was observed, and it resulted in a rapid drop in hydrogen production rate as well.

AB Samia cynthia ricini (Lepidoptera: Saturniidae), the Indian eri silkworm, contributes significantly to the production of commercial silk and is widely distributed in the Brahmaputra river valley in North-Eastern India. Due to over exploitation coupled with rapid deforestation, most of the natural populations of S. cynthia ricini are dwindling rapidly and its preservation has become an important goal. Assessment of the genetic structure of each population is a prerequisite for a sustainable conservation program. DNA fingerprinting to detect genetic variation has been used in different insect species not only between populations, but also between individuals within a population. Since, information on the genetic basis of phenotypic variability and genetic diversity within the S. cynthia ricini populations is scanty, inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR) system was used to assess genetic diversity and differentiation among six commercially exploited S. cynthia ricini populations. Twenty ISSR primers produced 87% of inter population variability among the six populations. Genetic distance was lowest between the populations Khanapara (E5) and Mendipathar (E6) (0.0654) and highest between Dhanubhanga (E4) and Titabar (E3) (0.3811). Within population, heterozygosity was higher in Borduar (E2) (0.1093) and lowest in Titabar ( E3) (0.0510). Highest gene flow (0.9035) was between E5 and E6 and the lowest (0.2172) was between E3 and E5. Regression analysis showed positive correlation between genetic distance and geographic distance among the populations. The high GST value (0.657) among the populations combined with low gene flow contributes significantly to the genetic differentiation among the S. cynthia ricini populations. Based on genetic diversity, these populations can be considered as different ecotypes and in situ conservation of them is recommended.

AB The search for interaction between maintenance and production has been of great intensity in the manufacturing industries. With the maintenance policy it is possible to enhance the productivity in a global way. In this sense, the most used methodology is total productive maintenance-TPM, with its sustainable pillars guide will create routines that enable that interaction. Companies may be classified in three ways regarding to TPM: the ones that really have the structured and working methodology; the ones who say they have it, but they do not have even the structured basic principles; and the ones who had already established the pillars but let this structure to fall serving its fragments only to satisfy the audit. This paper is about this third case, where the main factors that lead to the gradual abandonment of already reached levels of excellence of application of the TPM methodology is presented. For the analysis of the problem operators, maintenance people and managers involved in the productive process were heard. This document was elaborated based on these multiple visions.

AB In membrane processes, fouling remains the main drawback and the toughest challenge at present and in the foreseeable future. The aim of this work was to combine anti-fouling strategies. In a membrane bioreactor (MBR) fed with synthetic wastewater with mixed liquor suspended solids concentrations between 3 and 10 g/L, the solid/liquid separation was achieved by a tubular membrane in side stream. For longer sustainable flux, air sparging was supplied to fight external fouling with the scouring effect of slug flow. Additional to that, backflushing was provided as a technique against internal fouling. The combination of both techniques showed very promising results and was superior to the operation of only one flux enhancement technique, yielding about three times higher fluxes compared to the NON-enhanced application after continuous filtration for 8 days. Backflushing accomplished significant flux increases with minimal product loss. The flux ratio of enhanced flux versus non-enhanced flux increased linearly with filtration time and air injection ratio. A simple model was developed to describe the development of the flux ratio over time for different air injection ratios. At high mixed liquor suspended solids concentrations (MLSS), where a high fouling potential exists, the combination of air sparging and back flushing was particularly effective in increasing the flux compared to non-enhanced filtration. Dimensionless fouling numbers increased with time, especially for lower air injection ratios. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Geochemical, microbiological, and molecular analyses of alkaline saline groundwater at 2.8 kilometers depth in Archaean metabasalt revealed a microbial biome dominated by a single phylotype affiliated with thermophilic sulfate reducers belonging to Firmicutes. These sulfate reducers were sustained by geologically produced sulfate and hydrogen at concentrations sufficient to maintain activities for millions of years with no apparent reliance on photosynthetically derived substrates.

TI Properties of high-quality long natural cellulose fibers from rice straw
SO JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD CHEMISTRY

DT Article

ID CORNHUSKS
AB This paper reports the structure and properties of novel long natural cellulose fibers obtained from rice straw. Rice straw fibers have 64% cellulose with 63% crystalline cellulose, strength of 3.5 g/denier (450 MPa), elongation of 2.2%, and modulus of 200 g/denier (26 GPa), similar to that of linen fibers. The rice straw fibers reported here have better properties than any other natural cellulose fiber obtained from an agricultural byproduct. With a worldwide annual availability of 580 million tons, rice straw is an annually renewable, abundant, and cheap source for natural cellulose fibers. Using rice straw for high-value fibrous applications will help to add value to the rice crops, provide a sustainable resource for fibers, and also benefit the environment.

AB [ 1] This paper investigates strategies to alleviate the effects of droughts on the profitability and sustainability of irrigated agriculture. These strategies include conjunctive management of surface water and groundwater resources, and engineered improvements such as lining of irrigation canals and addition of regional pumping well capacity. A spatially distributed simulation-optimization model was developed for an irrigated system consisting of multiple surface water reservoirs and an alluvial aquifer. The simulation model consists of an agronomic component and simulators describing the hydrologic system. The physical models account for storage and flow through the reservoirs, routing through the irrigation canals, and regional groundwater flow. The agronomic model describes crop productivity as a function of irrigation quantity and salinity, and determines agricultural profit. A profit maximization problem was formulated and solved using large-scale constrained gradient-based optimization. The model was applied to a real-world conjunctive surface water/groundwater management problem in the Yaqui Valley, an irrigated agricultural region in Sonora, Mexico. The model reproduces recorded reductions in agricultural production during a historical drought. These reductions were caused by a decline in surface water availability and limited installed pumping capacity. Results indicate that the impact of the historical 8-year drought could have been significantly reduced without affecting profit in wet years by better managing surface water and groundwater resources. Namely, groundwater could have been more heavily relied upon and surface water allocation capped at a sustainable level as an operating rule. Lining the irrigation canals would have resulted in water savings of 30% of historical reservoir releases during wet years, which could have been used in subsequent drier years to increase agricultural production. The benefits of a greater reliance on groundwater pumping by installing additional wells are limited due to pumping restrictions near the coast to avoid seawater intrusion and due to increased pumping costs.

AB The continuing decline of ocean fisheries and rise of global fish consumption has driven aquaculture growth by 10% annually over the last decade. The association of fish farms with disease emergence in sympatric wild fish stocks remains one of the most controversial and unresolved threats aquaculture poses to coastal ecosystems and fisheries. We report a comprehensive analysis of the spread and impact of farm-origin parasites on the survival of wild fish populations. We mathematically coupled extensive data sets of native parasitic sea lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) transmission and pathogenicity on migratory wild juvenile pink (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) and chum (Oncorhynchus keta) salmon. Farm-origin lice induced 9-95% mortality in several sympatric wild juvenile pink and chum salmon populations. The epizootics arise through a mechanism that is new to our understanding of emerging infectious diseases: fish farms undermine a functional role of host migration in protecting juvenile hosts from parasites associated with adult hosts. Although the migratory life cycles of Pacific salmon naturally separate adults from juveniles, fish farms provide L. salmonis novel access to juvenile hosts, in this case raising infection rates for at least the first approximate to 2.5 months of the salmon's marine life (approximate to 80 km of the migration route). Spatial segregation between juveniles and adults is common among temperate marine fishes, and as aquaculture continues its rapid growth, this disease mechanism may challenge the sustainability of coastal ecosystems and economies.

AB This paper describes the development of the American Indian Oncology Program (AIOP) and presents the accomplishments of a participatory research approach that involved an integrated network for cancer care and research. AIOP used a participatory process to develop infrastructure, identify research questions, develop methodologies, write supplemental grants, and evaluate accomplishments based on community defined measures of success. Partnerships between University and Indian Health Service, private, and state institutions led to improved collaboration. Health services delivery improved by increasing provider involvement at multiple institutions via a Tumor Board. Community awareness improved through workshops addressing community-specific cancer concerns. Collectively, these resulted in an environment receptive to the development of research activities. The AIOP team, through a participatory process, developed infrastructure at each institution that facilitated interaction, community-based education, and improved patient care; identified new partners; raised community-level knowledge and awareness about cancer; encouraged a research-friendly environment and building research capacity; and increased the cultural competency of researchers wishing to work in American Indian communities and created a cadre of future American Indian cancer researchers. As evidenced by successful pilot project development and formation of ongoing research and funding applications, the authors created a research-receptive environment and promoted potentially sustainable research capacity in the community. Much of their success is the result of utilizing a participatory model for capacity building that included not only communities but institutions.

AB Asian Americans are the fastest growing and the second largest foreign-born ethnic group in the United States. Cancer is a leading cause of death among Asian Americans. The Asian Tobacco Education and Cancer Awareness Research (ATECAR) Special Population Network, Center for Asian Health, aimed to reduce or eliminate cancer health disparities in these diverse, underserved populations in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, and New York. The ATECAR logic model was adapted from a variety of conceptual frameworks to develop and implement the network's multifaceted cancer health disparities research, training, awareness, and outreach programs. The model was the basis for the developmental phases of the network that included (1) needs assessment, infrastructure, and partnership building; (2) intervention research, training, and mentorship; and (3) evaluation, dissemination, and diffusion. Community involvement occurred at every operational level to ensure program and network sustainability. Between 2000 and 2005, the ATECAR network consisted of 88 partners, representing a cross-section of Asian communities, academia, cancer centers, and health service agencies, ensuring a viable infrastructure for the network's multidimensional cancer health disparities programs. ATECAR's research covered tobacco control, cancer prevention and intervention, and clinical trials. More than 22 research projects were conducted and their results disseminated in peer-reviewed journals. ATECAR also trained 76 junior researchers and special population investigators and 1014 community professionals in disparity issues. ATECAR's multimedia cancer awareness education program reached over 116,000 Asians. The ATECAR network's achievements have had a profound impact on Asian Americans and established a trend toward reducing cancer health disparities, especially among underserved Asian Americans.

AB The unequal burden of cancer in minority and underserved communities nationally and in Maryland is a compelling crisis. The Maryland Special Populations Cancer Research Network (MSPN) developed an infrastructure covering Maryland's 23 jurisdictions and Baltimore City through formal partnerships between the University of Maryland School of Medicine, University of Maryland Statewide Health Network, University of Maryland Eastern Shore, and community partners in Baltimore City, rural Eastern Shore, rural Western Maryland, rural Southern Maryland, and Piscataway Conoy Tribe and statewide American Indians. Guided by the community-based participatory framework, the MSPN undertook a comprehensive assessment (of needs, strengths, and resources available) that laid the foundation for programmatic efforts in community-initiated cancer awareness and education, research, and training. The MSPN infrastructure was used to implement successful and innovative community-based cancer education interventions and technological solutions; conduct education and promotion of clinical trials, cancer health disparities research, and minority faculty cancer research career development; and leverage additional resources for sustainability. MSPN engaged in informed advocacy among decision- and policyrnakers at state and national levels, and its community-based clinical trials program was recognized by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services as a Best Practice Award. The solutions to reduce and eliminate cancer health disparities are complex and require comprehensive and focused multidisciplinary cancer health disparities research, training, and education strategies implemented through robust community-academic partnerships.

AB Sustainability indicators based on local data provide a practical method to monitor progress towards sustainable development. However, since there are many conflicting frameworks proposed to develop indicators, it is unclear how best to collect these data. The purpose of this paper is to analyse the literature on developing and applying sustainability indicators at local scales to develop a methodological framework that summarises best practice. First, two ideological paradigms are outlined: one that is expert-led and top-down, and one that is community-based and bottom-up. Second, the paper assesses the methodological steps proposed in each paradigm to identify, select and measure indicators. Finally, the paper concludes by proposing a learning process that integrates best practice for stakeholder-led local sustainability assessments. By integrating approaches from different paradigms, the proposed process offers a holistic approach for measuring progress towards sustainable development. It emphasizes the importance of participatory approaches setting the context for sustainability assessment at local scales, but stresses the role of expert-led methods in indicator evaluation and dissemination. Research findings from around the world are used to show how the proposed process can be used to develop quantitative and qualitative indicators that are both scientifically rigorous and objective while remaining easy to collect and interpret for communities.

AB The paper introduces two approaches to identify corporate behaviours that should attract the attention of pension funds in the context of debates over sustainability, while remaining within a narrow interpretation of their fiduciary duty. The approaches are based on two simple models of how different societal spheres interact with one another and influence long-term economic performance. These models allow exploring the idea that corporations can influence trajectories of societal change-keeping in mind that pension funds care about these trajectories because they care about the long-term performance of the economies in which they invest. The model underlying the internalising investor approach assumes that corporations are the only actors in society. In this model, pension funds will maximise their expected ability to meet their liabilities if companies internalise negative externalities and spill-over effects in order to reduce the cost of market failures for the economy as a whole. The model underlying the civic investor approach comprises companies and various actors (the state, NGOs, corporate stakeholders) engaged in shaping the governance structure that mediates the interaction between the social, environmental and economic spheres. In this model, pension funds will want companies to facilitate effective responses to societal problems. These approaches allow us to identify a number of corporate behaviours that should be of concern to pension funds. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we account for forest wealth in India. Changes in the timber and carbon wealth embodied in these forests are related to important green national accounting aggregates such as genuine saving and the change in wealth per capita. Important accounting issues include the timing of carbon releases that occur when forests are disturbed, as well as the valuation of these releases. Our empirical findings suggest that while India's forest wealth is substantial, net changes in this wealth are arguably not so large at least in relation to GNP. However, when viewed in the context of the wealth-diluting effects of population growth this implies a far larger additional savings effort is required to cover the (net) loss in forest values than otherwise appears to be the case. Finally, we examine ways in which the accounting approach that we adopt can be reconciled with approaches which stress conserving forest wealth. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID LOCAL COMMONS
AB This paper analyses the heterogeneous users decision to participate in co-management, which is an institutional alternative proposed in the wake of state's failure in managing the Cochin estuarine fisheries in Kerala, India. Since a collective action under co-management require not only user's active participation in terms of their labor but also involve various types of organizational and managerial costs, the users were given the following choices on co-operation. Firstly, the users had the choice to contribute their labor in conservation activities which would ensure sustainability of the fisheries. Secondly, they could make a voluntary contribution towards meeting the organizational costs of collective action. Thirdly, they could contribute in terms of labor as well as in monetary terms. Finally, they had the choice not to participate at all. Keeping in view the problems of free rider and the chances for adoption of strategic behavior by users some incentives were given for each of the above ways of co-operation. A multinomial logit analysis of the decision of about 369 sample fishermen to participate in co-management as defined above shows the differential impact of user heterogeneity in resource management. While heterogeneity in terms of the present legal status of the users motivate them for contributing their labor even in the absence of any additional economic incentives, heterogeneity in economic status and membership in formal organizations matters when it comes to making monetary payments. in addition to these, the overall optimism of the users' motivates them to both physically engage in conservation activities as well as make monetary payments. Adoption of strategic behaviors by at least some users cannot, however, be ruled out. On the whole, it is seen that the heterogeneous fishermen's decision to participate depends upon their anticipation of the distribution of benefits from co-operation. However, one must be cautious that those who anticipate disproportionate benefit from co-operation are likely to take a lead role. Therefore, care must be taken to prevent them from deciding the rules of the game in such a manner that they are disproportionately in their favor. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Prebisch's approach to economic development was based on the notion that there is an international historical division of labour. Peripheral countries are specialised in exporting primary goods while Centre countries export industrial goods. The Terms of Trade for peripheral countries tend to deteriorate. This approach can be extended to ecological issues. The international Centre-Periphery division does not only involve the monetary exchange of goods and capital, but also the physical exchange in which Southern countries provide materials and energy so that Northern countries can develop their socioeconomic metabolism. This metabolic process is guaranteed through cheap prices for primary goods. This paper aims to apply and extend Prebisch's thought on unequal exchange, both monetary and ecological, in relation to Colombian trade in the period 1970-2002, using Material Flow Analysis.

AB This article describes the biological background, the model-building methodology and some applications of SIMBA-NEM, a new model to simulate the population dynamics of two major plant-parasitic nematode species of banana, Radopholus similis and Pratylenchus coffeae. For each species, each generation is represented by one cohort. Cohorts of the same species form a chain representing the developmental stages of nematodes. A logistic function describes population growth in relation with: (i) an environmental carrying capacity (K) that depends on available banana root biomass, (ii) an intrinsic growth rate (c) and (iii) competition between nematode species. Soil water content and the quantity of nematicides used are considered to be the main variables influencing the intrinsic population growth rate of each species. SIMBA-NEM was calibrated and validated using datasets from banana cropping systems in Guadeloupe (French West Indies). By analysing the sensitivity of the model to the main parameters and performing simulations of validation for various cropping systems (banana monoculture with or without nematicide applications use and a banana/sugarcane rotation) we were able to test the ability of the model to predict nematode population dynamics under a range of conditions. SIMBA-NEM is able to predict long-term nematode population size, while taking interspecific competition into account. It also helped to define knowledge gaps in nematology and modelling. SIMBA-NEM was used to optimise the effect of nematicide applications. SIMBA-NEM can already be a very helpful tool for designing sustainable and more environment-friendly banana cropping systems. In the SIMBA global crop-modelling environment, SIMBA-NEM is a key sub-model which provides essential information concerning the sustainability of the simulated system and thus permits planning environmentally friendly cropping systems.

AB Human civilization is considered a system producing and storing useful information (knowledge). Starting from the fact that biological parameters of humans (concerning, first of all, properties of genome and brain) were little changed over the past million years, we find that: (1) human population increases exponentially with storing knowledge (if there are no environmental limitations); (2) population size is proportional to the total information production rate. These statements allow explaining the well-known 'explosive' (hyperbolic with time) law of human population growth and thereby disclosing its informational nature. This mode of growth has operated during the past million years and ceases its operation in our time. Deviations from this law increasing since the late twentieth century are caused by environmental limitations. Population dynamics in this transition period can also be obtained from the informational background. For this purpose, we estimate information content and production rate. Humankind has stored up to date: similar to 10(14) bits in external memory (funds of libraries), similar to 10(11) bits in genetic memory and similar to 10(12)-10(13) bits in neural memory. information is produced on the channels of genetic, neural and external memory with approximately equal rates similar to 10(1)-10(2) bits per capita per year. We introduce an informational paradigm, which states that information is an independent, developing entity obeying its own evolutionary laws. This paradigm allows constructing informational dynamics of civilization based on the least action principle. Dynamic equations are derived for different modes of information production. On this basis, we find equations of world demographic dynamics, which describe not only the explosive growth, but also the present-day transition period with gradual cessation of growth and with different scenarios of subsequent population trend: from stabilization at high levels to reduction to the Earth's long-term sustainable level. The equations obtained generalize some current models of global population growth with regard to the dynamics of information production and show how the intrinsic controllability of civilization and environmental limitations can, via model parameters, influence the subsequent development. Altogether, the informational framework developed offers a regular method for finding different phenomenological models of population dynamics. Finally, we formulate the informational imperative stating that the global demographic process adjusts to the accumulation of information. Thus, information is the only driving force of the development of civilization. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Recently, a significant increase in macrophyte growth has been observed in many lowland rivers in Flanders, mainly due to eutrophication and an improvement of the water quality. This growth strongly influences the channel roughness (Manning-n). The first purpose of the project was a better understanding of the complex relationship between biomass development and discharge capacity in lowland rivers. In order to avoid the backing up of water upstream, the whole vegetation body is usually mowed annually. This project also investigated a lighter ecological management of aquatic plants in which only a part of the vegetation is removed in separate and alternating blocks, seeking a compromise between sufficient discharge and conserving large parts of the macrophyte vegetation with all its functions. Beside laboratory experiments, field survey was undertaken in the Grote Caliebeek, a tributary of the Kleine Nete in Flanders, Belgium. The results indicated that the presence of macrophytes in lowland rivers slowed down the waterflow and resulted in a raised water level. The upstream water level followed biomass development at a certain discharge level. The mowing experiments and the field survey indicated that alternating weed cutting patterns can reduce fall in an effective way. This research emphasizes the possibilities of alternating weed cutting patterns in order to deal with water flow problems. In the long term there will be the need for a better understanding of the ecological relationships in the search for a sustainable integrated method of controlling aquatic vegetation.

AB Fish population variability and fisheries activities are closely linked to weather and climate dynamics. While weather at sea directly affects fishing, environmental variability determines the distribution, migration, and abundance of fish. Fishery science grew up during the last century by integrating knowledge from oceanography, fish biology, marine ecology, and fish population dynamics, largely focused on the great Northern Hemisphere fisheries. During this period, understanding and explaining interannual fish recruitment variability became a major focus for fisheries oceanographers. Yet, the close link between climate and fisheries is best illustrated by the effect of "unexpected" events-that is, nonseasonal, and sometimes catastrophic-on fish exploitation, such as those associated with the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The observation that fish populations fluctuate at decadal time scales and show patterns of synchrony while being geographically separated drew attention to oceanographic processes driven by low-frequency signals, as reflected by indices tracking large-scale climate patterns such as the Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). This low-frequency variability was first observed in catch fluctuations of small pelagic fish (anchovies and sardines), but similar effects soon emerged for larger fish such as salmon, various groundfish species, and some tuna species. Today, the availability of long time series of observations combined with major scientific advances in sampling and modeling the oceans' ecosystems allows fisheries science to investigate processes generating variability in abundance, distribution, and dynamics of fish species at daily. decadal, and even centennial scales. These studies are central to the research program of Global Ocean Ecosystems Dynamics (GLOBEC). This review presents examples of relationships between climate variability and fisheries at these different time scales for species covering various marine ecosystems ranging from equatorial to subarctic regions. Some of the known mechanisms linking climate variability and exploited fish populations are described, as well as some leading hypotheses, and their implications for their management and for the modeling of their dynamics. It is concluded with recommendations for collaborative work between climatologists, oceanographers, and fisheries scientists to resolve some of the outstanding problems in the development of sustainable fisheries.

AB The relative roles played by the remote El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) forcing and the local air-sea interactions in the tropical Atlantic are investigated using an intermediate coupled model (ICM) of the tropical Atlantic. The oceanic component of the ICM consists of a six-baroclinic mode ocean model and a simple mixed layer model that has been validated from observations. The atmospheric component is a global atmospheric general circulation model developed at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). In a forced context, the ICM realistically simulates both the sea surface temperature anomaly (SSTA) variability in the equatorial band, and the relaxation of the Atlantic northeast trade winds and the intensification of the equatorial westerlies in boreal spring that usually follows an El Nino event.
   The results of coupled experiments with or without Pacific ENSO forcing and with or without explicit air-sea interactions in the equatorial Atlantic indicate that the background energy in the equatorial Atlantic is provided by ENSO. However, the time scale of the variability and the magnitude of some peculiar events cannot be explained solely by ENSO remote forcing. It is demonstrated that the peak of SSTA variability in the 1-3-yr band as observed in the equatorial Atlantic is due to the local air-sea interactions and is not a linear response to ENSO. Seasonal phase locking in boreal summer is also the result of the local coupling. The analysis of the intrinsic sustainable modes indicates that the Atlantic El Nino is qualitatively a noise-driven stable system. Such a system can produce coherent interdecadal variability that is not forced by the Pacific or extraequatorial variability. It is shown that when a simple slab mixed layer model is embedded into the system to simulate the northern tropical Atlantic (NTA) SST variability, the warming over NTA following El Nino events have characteristics (location and peak phase) that depend on air-sea interaction in the equatorial Atlantic. In the model, the interaction between the equatorial mode and NTA can produce a dipolelike structure of the SSTA variability that evolves at a decadal time scale. The results herein illustrate the complexity of the tropical Atlantic ocean-atmosphere system, whose predictability jointly depends on ENSO and the connections between the Atlantic modes of variability.

AB Distributed ecohydrological modelling can provide a useful toot to evaluate the performance of irrigation systems at different spatial and temporal scales. Sirsa district, covering 4270 km(2) in the western part of Haryana State (India), has been selected for a case study with typical problems of canal water scarcity, poor groundwater quality, rising and declining groundwater levels, and sub-optimal, crop production. The field scale ecohydrological model SWAP including detailed crop growth simulations was extended in a distributed manner to quantify the required hydrological. and biophysical variables for all combinations of weather-crop-soil-irrigation in the study area. Field experiments, satellite images and existing geographical data were used to aggregate the representative input parameters of all so-called homogeneous simulation units' and their boundary conditions. The simulated mean annual evapotranspiration (689 mm) over the entire Sirsa district was 15% lower as compared to the mean annual evapotranspiration (809 mm) estimated by independent remote sensing approach. The simulated water and salt limited crop yields showed a good correspondence with the independent crop yields data obtained from remote sensing, field measurements and statistical records. The performance of Sirsa district during the agricultural year 2001-2002 was evaluated in terms of water productivity, net groundwater recharge and salt build-up. Factors responsible for tow water productivity in Sirsa district include a high percentage of soil evaporation into evapotranspiration (17-54%, highest for rice), percolation from fields and seepage losses from the conveyance system (34-43% of the total canal inflow). The study also revealed a Large variation of net groundwater recharge and salt build-up over different canal commands, which threatens the sustainabitity of irrigated agriculture in Sirsa district.

AB Carbon management is a serious concern confronting the world today. A number of summits have been organized on this subject ranging from the Stockholm to Kyoto protocol. The current level of carbon in the atmosphere is about 375 ppm. It is estimated that if the carbon increases in the atmosphere at the present rate and no positive efforts are pursued, the level of carbon in the atmosphere would go up to 800-1000 ppm by the end of current century, which may create havoc for all living creatures on earth. Soil may be an important sink for the carbon storage in the form of soil organic carbon. This form of carbon is also a matter of serious concern for agricultural scientists across the globe because various researches reveal that the soil under intensive cultivation results in declining potential productivity due to reduction in soil organic carbon, thereby proving an obstacle for sustainable agriculture. Plants are the main source of the soil organic carbon, either from the decomposition of aerial plant parts or underground plant parts, e.g. roots in the form of root death, root exudates and root respiration. About 40% of the photosynthates synthesized in the plant parts is lost through the root system into the rhizosphere within an hour and the rate of loss is influenced by several factors, e.g. plant age, different biotic and abiotic stresses, etc. The rhizospheric environment of the plant is different compared to bulk soil with respect to physical, chemical and biological properties. Thus the aim of this article is to provide an insight on the contribution of plant roots for transfer of carbon from atmosphere to rhizosphere and further their significance in sustainable agriculture.

TI Trade-offs between cost minimization and equity in water quality

AB [ 1] Allocation of pollution control responsibilities is an important problem in environmental economics. Previous research has developed the least-cost formulation that addresses both cost efficiency and hydrologic uncertainty. However, the least-cost formulation does not explicitly consider the distribution of pollution control responsibilities that has a serious implication on equity. A theoretical framework for evaluating the trade-offs between cost efficiency and equity is developed in this work. In this paper the efficiency equity curve that defines the cost of achieving equity is developed. It also evaluates the impacts of hydrologic variability and parameter uncertainty on the trade-off between cost efficiency and equity, and the impacts of the choice of equity criteria on phosphorus management decisions. A demonstration example is also presented that analyzed phosphorus management in the Fishtrap Creek catchment and the lower Nooksack River basin located in northwestern Washington State.

AB A new desalination technology named Desalination Pipeline is proposed. The Desalination Pipeline system enables simultaneously desalination and efficient transport of distilled water by applying the working principle of a heat pipe without its liquid recirculation function. The energy source for the operation of the Desalination Pipeline system is the temperature difference between seawater and inland atmosphere. A formulation for the model calculation of the Desalination Pipeline system is established and verified by a laboratory experiment. And then, an estimation of the production and the transportation rates of distilled water is performed on the basis of the existing environmental and climate data of two target regions, Sana'a, the capital of Republic of Yemen, and El-Quren in Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. The estimation result indicates that the Desalination Pipeline system can supply distilled water through one year for some inland area about 100 kin apart from the coastal area at a distilled water production rate of 3.2-35.0 L/min (about 10,000 m(3)/y) for a pipe with a diameter of 2 in, 19-205 L/min (about 60,000 m(3)/y) for a pipe with a diameter of 4 in. The latter nearly matches the flow rate through a small qanat 60-1500 L/min.

AB The low subtropical zone is the most populated and seriously degraded area in China; therefore, highly efficient restoration of degraded lands is the key to sustainable development of this region. An agro-forest restoration mode consisting of an Acacia mangium forest, a Citrus reticulata orchard, a Pennisetum purpureum grassland, and a fishpond has been applied widely in this region. Emergy synthesis was performed at the system and subsystem levels of organization to clarify the structural and functional attributes of this restoration system for further optimization. Emergy indices, including four new indices, the emergy restoration ratio (ERR), the ecological economic product (EEP), the emergy benefit ratio (EBR), and the emergy benefit after exchange (EBE), were formulated to evaluate the ecological and economic benefits of this restoration mode. Benefits were determined for the separate subsystems and for the system as a whole, based on the classification of human services into management and harvest costs. The emergy sustainability index (ESI) of the agro-forest restoration system was 16 and the emergy index for sustainable development (EISD) was 122, demonstrating that this system produces high ecological and economic benefits and that it is a good alternative for the restoration of hillside areas in subtropical China.

AB A combined school- and community-based campaign targeting the entire school-age population of Burkina Faso with drugs against schistosomiasis (praziquantel) and soil-transmitted helminthiasis (albendazole) was implemented in 2004-2005. In total, 3,322,564 children from 5 to 15 years of age were treated, equivalent to a 90.8% coverage of the total school-age population of the country. The total costs of the campaign were estimated to be US$ 1,067,284, of which 69.4% was spent on the drugs. Delivery costs per child treated were US$ 0.098, in the same range as school-based only interventions implemented in other countries; total costs per child treated (including drugs) were US$ 0.32. We conclude that a combined school- and community-based strategy is effective in attaining a high coverage among school-age children in countries where school enrolment is low and where primary schools cannot serve as the exclusive drug distribution points. The challenge for Burkina Faso will now be to ensure the sustainability of these disease control activities. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID FLUORINE
AB Organofluorine compounds have become integrated into the infrastructure of modern society. However, concerns over toxicity and persistence in the environment are causing reassessment of the use of many industrial organofluorine products. A risk-benefit analysis of these unique compounds and life-cycle studies of the major types of organofluorine compounds are conducted in this article in order to identify and address the real issues of concern.

AB Shape is an important consideration in green building design due to its significant impact on energy performance and construction costs. This paper presents a methodology to optimize building shapes in plan using the genetic algorithm. The building footprint is represented by a multi-sided polygon. Different geometrical representations for a polygon are considered and evaluated in terms of their potential problems such as epistasis, which occurs when one gene pair masks or modifies the expression of other gene pairs, and encoding isomorphism. which occurs when chromosomes with different binary strings map to the same solution in the design space. Two alternative representations are compared in terms of their impact on computational effectiveness and efficiency. An optimization model is established considering the shape-related variables and several other envelope-related design variables such as window ratios and overhangs. Life-cycle cost and life-cycle environmental impact are the two objective functions used to evaluate the performance of a green building design. A case study is presented where the shape of a typical floor of an office building defined by a pentagon is optimized with a multiobjective genetic algorithm. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

   French procedure of sustainable agriculture
SO AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
LA English

ID FRAMEWORK
AB There is a widespread consensus about the importance of sustainable agriculture. In France, the Farming Orientation Law of July 1999 has set down a precise procedure for the implementation of sustainable agriculture: the contrat territorial d'exploitation - or territorial farm contract (TFC). This paper aims to analyse the TFC effectiveness. An analysis has been made of the TFCs signed in the Midi-Pyrenees Region in south-western France, using statistical analysis and qualitative surveys of a sample of farms. The results show that the most valuable effects have been mainly economic. Effects regarding social and environmental aspects were very limited. But from the point of view of an integrated approach, indirect effects of TFCs can be observed on social and environmental aspects. These results are explained, on the one hand, by farmers' motivations guided by economic objectives, and on the other hand, by the dominance of professional farming organisations in the implementation of TFC's procedure. Given these results, two ways of improving the elaboration procedure for TFCs are proposed. Firstly, technical improvements can be made to the diagnostic assessment of farms, and to the choice of actions addressed by the contract. Secondly, organisational improvements can be applied to TFCs elaboration and implementation process, in order to adopt a participatory approach which would involve all rural stakeholders.

AB Some models anticipate that liberalized agricultural trade will lead to increased crop diversity, while other models make the opposite claim. These positions were explored in southwestern British Columbia, Canada where, between 1992 and 1998, government subsidies and other measures designed to protect horticultural farmers were lifted, exposing these farmers to foreign competition. Public hearings on the future of agriculture provided an opportunity to tap the knowledge and experience of people affected by this transition. Analysis of transcripts from these hearings, which was confirmed by industry data, shows that trade liberalization has led to the loss of the local fruit and vegetable processing industry. Stakeholders saw the loss as a major factor affecting the choice of crops grown locally. To test this assertion, crop diversity data were analyzed, differentiating crops grown for the processing industry from those grown for the fresh market. Results show that crop diversity increased for processing crops but not for fresh crops. Farmers who used to produce commodities for the fruit and vegetable processing industry seem to have been forced to find new crops to cope with the decline in the processing industry. Here then is a case where the effects of trade were indirect (they were mediated by another variable: the loss of the processing industry) and variable (they differed for the two groups of crops). This may have significant environmental implications as scientific research shows that diverse agro-ecosystems are better able to withstand pest outbreaks and require less agri-chemicals than simple systems.

DE content analysis; discourse; genetic engineering; organic food
AB This paper undertakes a content analysis of newspaper articles from Australia, the UK, and the US concerned with a variety of issues relevant to sustainable food and agriculture from 1996 to 2002. It then goes on to identify the various ways in which sustainability, organic food and agriculture, genetic engineering, genetically modified foods, and food safety are framed both in their own terms and in relation to each other. It finds that despite the many competing approaches to sustainability found in scientific and agricultural production discourses, media discourses tend to reduce this complexity to a straightforward conflict between organic and conventional foods. Despite regular reporting of viewpoints highly critical of organic food and agriculture, this binary opposition produces discourses in which organic foods are seen as more-or-less synonymous with safety, naturalness and nutrition, and their alternatives as artificial, threatening, and untrustworthy. Particularly controversial food-related issues such as genetic engineering, food scares, chemical residues, and regulatory failure are treated as part of the same problem to which organic food offers a trustworthy and easily understood solution.

AB This paper examines sustainable agriculture's steady rise as a legitimate farm management system. In doing this, it offers an account of social change that centers on trust and its intersection with networks of knowledge. The argument to follow is informed by the works of Foucault and Latour but moves beyond this literature in important ways. Guided by and building upon earlier conceptual framework first forwarded by Carolan and Bell (2003, Environmental Values 12: 225-245), sustainable agriculture is examined through the lens of a "phenomenological challenge." In doing this, analytic emphasis centers on the interpretative resources of everyday life and the artful act of practice - in other words, on "the local." Research data involving Iowa farmers and agriculture professionals are examined to understand how social relations of trust and knowledge are contested and shaped within and between agricultural social networks and organizational configurations. All of this is meant to further our understanding of what "sustainable agriculture" is and is not, who it is, and how these boundaries change over time.

AB Salal (Gaultheria shallon Pursh), which is widely used for floral greenery, is an important non-timber forest product (NTFP) from the coastal forests of the Pacific Northwest of North America. However, there are no known studies on the impacts of commercial salal harvesting on subsequent growth. A study was therefore initiated to quantify the growth of salal 1 year after commercial harvesting, and to compare this with growth of unharvested salal. The amount of biomass removed from shrubs through commercial harvesting (131 g m(-2)) was the same as the amount of annual growth in adjacent undisturbed plots (135 g m(-2)). One year later, the amount of regrowth in previously harvested plots (144 g m(-2)) was greater than the amount of new growth in adjacent undisturbed plots (111 g m(-2)). As there was little difference in the weight per current stem, the increased biomass after commercial harvesting was attributed to the observed increase in stem number (60 stems m(-2)) as compared to undisturbed salal (50 stems m(-2)). Our study does not incorporate either repeated annual harvesting or variable harvesting intensities, both of which have been anecdotally reported to affect levels of re-growth and therefore sustainability.

AB Classical, soluble fertilisers create environmental and economic problems. As an alternative, we studied the direct applications of phosphate rock and potassium rock in conjunction with phosphate-solubilising bacteria and potassium-solubilising bacteria for cultivation of hot pepper Capsicum annuum L. Our findings show that integration of P and K rocks with inoculation of P- and K-solubilising bacteria increased P availability from 12 to 21% and K availability from 13 to 15% in the soil as compared with control, and subsequently improved nutrient ( N, P and K) uptake to the plant. This integration also increased plant photosynthesis by 16% and leaf area by 35% as compared with control plants. Similarly, biomass harvest and fruit yield of the treated plants were 23% and 30%, respectively, higher as compared with control. Overall, we found that the treatment with P and K rocks and PK-solubilising bacterial strains and the treatment with classical, soluble fertiliser have a similar effectiveness. Therefore, direct application of P and K rocks and solubilising bacteria is a promising, sustainable alternative to the use of classical fertilisers.

TI Comparative analysis of goldenseal (Hydrastis canadensis L.) population
   re-growth following human harvest: Implications for conservation

AB Goldenseal is an uncommon woodland herb whose rhizomes are widely harvested for their medicinal properties. Goldenseal populations regenerate from vegetative propagules that are broken-off from the primary rhizome during harvesting activities. While previous studies reported significant variability in re-growth among harvested populations, it is not entirely clear what drives differences in population re-growth. One hypothesis is that goldenseal populations re-grow at greater rates when harvested during the fall compared to mid-summer. Over a 4 y period, we biennially censused the re-growth of a goldenseal population that was wild-harvested during the fall 2001 from the Wayne National Forest in southern Ohio. Data were compared to previous studies that quantified the re-growth of a goldenseal population wild-harvested during the fall in West Virginia and to goldenseal populations (n = 3) experimentally harvested during mid-summer. Among the two fall-harvested populations, ramet densities increased by twofold in the Ohio population, but remained relatively stable in the West Virginia population. In contrast, average ramet leaf size was remarkably similar 2 and 4 y post-harvest, although the Ohio population appeared to be recovering at slightly faster rates. Comparison of data between all harvested populations supports a previous hypothesis that average ramet leaf-size in fall-harvested (after September) populations may recover at faster rates than populations harvested during mid-summer. Late-summer and fall represents the period in which goldenseal rhizomes are traditionally gathered. Based on cumulative results from these harvest studies and more recent studies on goldenseal ecology, we discuss some of the implications of wild-harvesting on goldenseal population growth and persistence. Determining sustainable harvesting rates under contrasting harvester regimes warrants further research.

   how heat stress and energy deficit constrain milk yield and cow

AB The 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development focussed attention on agricultural sustainability and biodiversity in developing countries. These goals are relevant for livestock production in Kenya, where development agencies encourage resource-poor smallholders to acquire large, exotic, high-yielding dairy cows, despite their poor performance, revealed in recent surveys in the highlands and at the coast. The performance of the cows is not in question. The debate relates to the diagnosis of the causes, their treatment and the prognosis for the production system. To improve our understanding of the dynamics of the system, models of nutrition and energy, modified for the tropics, were used to measure the thermal responses over 24 h of six pure or crossbred Friesians at a mean lactation of 54 (s.d. 21.6) days, in separate zero-grazing units. Four smallholdings were on the hot, humid coast and two in the cooler highlands. The output of the model runs was related to the subsequent lactation, calving interval and profitability of the cows. The model showed that the thermal load caused moderate stress for all cows during the day, which became severe in the sun in the highlands, but the drop in air temperature, from 27 degrees C to 13 degrees C, at night dissipated the gain in body heat. At the coast, where the night temperature remained above 24 degrees C and relative humidity above 0.85, there was no remission of heat stress for cows with a milk yield greater than 11 l/day. The lactation curve, in all cows, declined from an initial peak to a low profile of 5 l/day. Cows in both regions with initial yields above 20 l/day had the steepest decline and longest calving intervals (457 to 662 days). They had the largest lactation yields and lowest direct cost per litre, but their poor breeding record reduced cull sales and increased replacement cost, raising the total cost per litre. By contrast, the cow with the lowest daily and lactation yield had the highest direct cost, but lowest total cost per litre, because she produced 2 heifer calves at an interval of only 317 days. These case studies serve as a reminder that, where heat load depresses appetite or poor food cannot support lactation, the energy deficit and stress reduces cow fertility, fitness, and longevity, so that she fails to breed a heifer replacement during her shortened productive life. The model predicted that food intake, depressed by heat stress, would not support a milk yield above 14 l/day and 30001 per annum at the coast, and 22 l/day and 50001 per annum in the highlands. Therefore, although appearing profitable in the short term, the current policy of promoting cows with higher yields than the climate and production system can support, is unsustainable. This outcome has implications for smallholder dairy development policy in Kenya, and probably elsewhere in the tropics. Instead, one should reconsider smaller exotic breeds and crossbreds with improved indigenous dairy cows whose overall productivity from milk yield, fecundity, longevity, and disease tolerance 50 years ago was better than that of the modem Holstein-Friesian in a Kenya smallholding.

AB The age structure of forests is one of the most important features for sustainable forest management. In this paper, an age distribution model is proposed which extends the age range in managed Pinus pinea L. forests. The method, termed extended rotation, consists of defining the theoretical global structure formed by several management circles, gradually reducing the area managed through longer rotations. The extended rotation method has been applied to obtain a target age distribution in a Pinus pinea forest. For this age distribution, the timber and pine nut (pine nut) production has been predicted for the next 40 years and compared with the most commonly applied method in Pinus pinea stands, the scattered periodic blocks management system. The application of the extended rotation method leads to a 15% timber yield loss, whereas there is a 10% pine nut production increment and the diversity of the age distribution and the basal area heterogeneity increase in the long term.

AB Interventions in a public debate about government policies to limit tourism growth in Malta are evaluated from an actor perspective on political economy. Attempts to influence growth policies are examined for their discourses, knowledge frameworks, and relative influence on the government. Government-related organizations led one intervention advocating sustainable development, but actually it was much affected by business considerations and technical rationality. A second effort by a heritage organization emphasized environmental concerns, but this lacked power to influence official policies. While a trade association had more direct influence on government, its call to halt hotel construction appears more influenced by concerns about profitability than conservation.

AB Surgical training commenced in 1975, the year that Papua New Guinea (PNG) gained independence. The training involves a 4-year programme leading to a Master of Medicine (MMed), awarded by the University of Papua New Guinea. In the past 30 years just over 50 general surgeons have graduated. There have also been 9 graduates in the area of ear nose and throat, 10 in ophthalmology and 2 in oral surgery. The subspecialization of general surgeons began in 1994 with four trainees, two orthopaedic, one head and neck and one urological. The model used was to develop specialist skills over 2-3 years only qualified (MMed) general surgeons so that their ability to carry out general surgical procedures and work in a remote hospital was not lost. The different specialties required different balances of in-country and out-of-country training depending on the local ability to provide training in PNG. An important sponsor has been the PNG National Department of Health, which has funded the training posts by using existing general surgical positions and covering the loss of manpower while surgeons are training overseas, sometimes for up to 2 years. Medical education and tertiary health service projects, funded by Aus-Aid, have also contributed significantly to the teaching and training. These projects have provided visiting specialists to teach and hospital attachments for national surgeons to train in Australasia. Various individual surgeons and their specialist societies in Australasia have also provided invaluable support. Three surgeons have been recipients of the Rowan Nicks scholarship. Twelve surgeons have been awarded a specialist diploma and a further five are in training. The posting of national specialist surgeons to Port Moresby has resulted in all modules of the General surgery MMed programme being taught by Papua New Guineans, which would have been hard to imagine back in 1993. The MMed is now a sustainable programme and can be provided without external support. National surgeons carry out a wide range of specialist procedures, formerly carried out only by visiting teams. They are also able to make outreach visits within PNG and specialist visits to neighbouring Pacific Island countries.

AB The emerging chemical society and new political demands on improved ecological sustainability have put the urban water and sanitation system under pressure. It is recognised that the users need to partake in the problem solving, but to influence human practice we must understand it. A theoretical framework, founded on time-geography and cultural analysis, was developed and applied in a study on the interrelationship between changes in water and sanitation arrangements at the household level and residents' routines. This article describes the theory cross-fertilisation and its prospect of application in studies of human environmental action. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The northern coastal part of Korinthia prefecture can be characterized as an agrotourism center that has grown and urbanized rapidly. The area is formed of recent unconsolidated material consisting of sands, pebbles, breccias and fine clay to silty sand deposits. These deposits host the main aquifer system of the area, which depends on groundwater as a water resource. Groundwater is the main source for irrigation in the area. A total water volume of 29.2 x 10(6)-34.3 x 10(6) m(3) yr(-1) was estimated to recharge the aquifer system from direct infiltration of rainfall, streambed infiltration, irrigation return, artificial recharge via flood irrigation and lateral subsurface inflows. The present annual abstraction ranges between 39.2 x 10(6) and 44.6 x 10(6) m(3) yr(-1). Groundwater abstraction in dry years exceeds renewable freshwater resources by more than 38%. Approximately 79% of the total abstraction is consumed for agriculture supply. Water balance in the coastal aquifer system is in disequilibrium; a deficit, which ranges from 4.9 x 10(6) to 15.4 x 10(6) m(3) yr(-1) exists. The safe yield of the coastal aquifer system has been estimated at 37.1 x 10(6) m(3) yr(-1) for normal hydrological year and 32 x 10(6) m(3) yr(-1) for severely dry hydrological year. The total abstraction is greater than the recharge and the safe yield of the aquifer. The aquifer system has shown signs of depletion, seawater intrusion and quality contamination. The integrated water resources management, securing water in the future, should include measures that augment groundwater budget in the coastal aquifer of the study area. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Optimisation of the confinement and sustainability of a thermonuclear plasma requires methods to monitor processes in the plasma. In this work three materials were used as activation targets (Ti, MgF2 and a TiVAl compound). They were placed inside the joint European Torus (JET) vacuum chamber. Certain gamma-ray emitting radionuclides (Be-7, Mn-54, Co-56, Co-57, Co-58 and Sc-46) were measured using ultra low-level gamma-ray spectrometry in an underground laboratory 1-2 months after activation. They were found to arise from neutron activation of bulk sample material and surface contaminants sputtered from other Tokamak parts. Decision thresholds for some activation products were determined in order to aid in giving upper bounds for the flux of charged particles. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Preservation or improvement of soil quality and productivity is of major importance for sustainable agriculture. Microorganisms strongly influence these soil characteristics as they are involved in nutrient cycling, transformation processes and soil aggregate formation, as well as in plant pathology or plant growth promotion. A profound understanding of structure, dynamics and functions of soil microbial populations represents one key to the understanding and description of soil quality. Therefore, we analyzed longterm effects of three farmyard manure (FYM)-based farming systems, i.e. bio-dynamic (BIODYN), bio-organic (BIOORG) and conventional (CONFYM), on microbiological soil characteristics and compared them to long-term effects of minerally fertilized (CONMIN) and unfertilized (NOFERT) control systems. Furthermore, we compared these long-term effects of farming systems to short-term effects of the crops winter wheat and grass-clover ley. The DOK field experiment in Therwil, Switzerland, which was established in 1978, represents in a unique long-term comparison, allowing to approach these questions. Effects on microbiological soil characteristics were assessed with a polyphasic approach by analyzing soil microbial biomass, soil DNA content, colony forming unit (CFU) counts, community level substrate utilization (CLSU) patterns with Biolog (TM) EcoPlates, and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) profiles of bacterial 16S rRNA genes. The soil biomass parameters, i.e. microbial biomass, DNA content and CFU, were all strongly influenced by the farming systems, whereas only CFUs were significantly affected by the two crops analyzed. Differences among the FYM-based farming systems BIODYN, 13100RG and CONFYM were only significant for microbial biomass and DNA content. CLSU and T-RFLP profiling, on the other hand, allowed for consistent differentiation of soil bacterial community structure in relation to the influence of farming systems and crops. The analyses revealed that the main and highly significant effect on microbiological soil characteristics was related to FYM applications. Less strong but significant effects were caused by the two crops, i.e. winter wheat and grass-clover. Effects of the farming systems BIODYN, BIOORG and CONFYM on soil bacterial community structure were relatively weak and not significant. These results suggest that for successful soil quality management fertilization regime and crop rotation are of major importance and that polyphasic approaches are needed to describe and assess microbiological soil characteristics.

AB This paper presented both the numerical simulations and experiments on the thermal performance of U-vertical ground coupled heat exchanger (UGCHE). The variation of the ground temperature and heat balance of the system were analyzed and compared in different operation modes in the numerical simulation. Experiments on the operation performance of the ground-coupled heat pump (GCHP) with the UGCHE were carried out. It shows that the ground source can be used as the heat source/sink for GCHP systems to have higher efficiency in saving energy. To preserve the ground resource for the sustainable utilization as heat source/sink, the heat emitted to ground and heat extracted from ground should be balanced. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

TI The comparative biodiversity of seven globally important wetlands: a
   synthesis
SO AQUATIC SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
DE wetlands; species diversity; comparison
AB The species diversity data of seven globally important wetlands (Canadian peatlands, Florida Everglades, Pantanal, Okavango Delta, Sundarban, Tonle Sap, and Kakadu National Park) were compared. The available data for most groups of lower plants and animals are insufficient for a comparative analysis. Data on vertebrates and higher plants are more complete and show high species diversity. The large habitat diversity allows the coexistence of amphibious species with many immigrants from connected deepwater and terrestrial habitats. Several of these immigrant species find an important permanent refuge in the wetlands; some use the wetlands as periodic habitats. All wetlands are important habitats for long-distance migratory bird species. The species composition reflects the biogeography of the respective regions, e.g. the high diversity of large ungulates characteristic for Africa is also found in the Okavango Delta in Botswana, and the high fish species diversity typical for South America is also reflected in the Pantanal in Brazil. The number of endemic species in most wetlands is low, except in the Everglades. The low numbers are explained to some extent by the dramatically changing paleo-climatic conditions that increased extinction rates, but also by the connection with large river systems that act as migratory and transport routes for species from large catchment areas and hinder the genetic isolation of wetland populations. The high number of endemic species in the Everglades is explained in part by its isolation on a peninsula. The relatively low nutrient status of most wetlands does not negatively affect species diversity and often leads to high animal densities. Large populations of endangered or rare species in all wetlands contribute to the great value of these areas for biodiversity protection. All wetlands are subjected to an increasing degree to human pressure through, e.g. water abstraction, changes in the natural flood regime, land reclamation, pollution, over-utilization of natural resources, and poaching. High habitat diversity and a pronounced natural disturbance regime make some of the wetlands vulnerable to invasion by exotic species, as shown for the Everglades. All studied wetlands are at least in part protected by national and international conventions. This provides perspectives for long-term protection only to a limited extent because of major environmental changes in their surroundings. Further strong efforts are required to match protection and sustainable use of the wetlands proper with management activities in their catchments.

AB Recycling of sewage sludge is needed in a sustainable society. Quality aspects of sludge include hygiene (pathogens), nutrients (N and P), and toxicants (metals and organics). Metals are of particular concern because they are not degradable, but their hazards are related to their bioavailability and chemical speciation. In this article, the effect on sludge quality of two treatment methods, incineration and pelletization, has been determined for digested sludge from two treatment plants. The combined effect of nutrients and toxicants in sludge and sludge product was determined for spring wheat, Triticum aestivum, and the toxicity of the leachate water was determined for water fleas, Daphnia magna, and seeds of lettuce, Lactuca sativa. Toxicity Identification Evaluation was used to determine whether metals were possible toxicants. The results indicated that incineration decreased toxicity, whereas leachability of metals and the fertilizing effect was unaffected. Pelletization seemed to increase toxicity and leachability of metals and also decreased the fertilizing effect of the sludge. Thus, the results suggest that pelletization of digested sewage sludge increased the toxicity of the sludge and thus decreased the quality of the sludge, whereas incineration apparently reduced toxicity for the two sludges tested.

AB Nitrate pollution from agricultural activities has become a common problem in the North China Plain due to overapplication of N fertilizer. Agroforestry is considered a potentially effective land-use practice for mitigating nitrate leaching. In this study, an agroforestry system of 1-2-year-old poplar (Populus x euramericana cl. '74/76') trees intercropped with winter wheat (Triticum aestivum) and maize (Zea mays) were rotated annually and compared with a sole-crop system in order to quantitatively investigate changes in NO3-N accumulation and water use following introduction of the trees into the farmland. The results revealed that evapotranspiration (ET) decreased by 6.1% and 3.7% during the wheat season and increased by 11.5% and 12.1% during the maize season, for fertilized and nonfertilized treatments intercropped with young poplar trees, respectively. NO3-N concentration decreased significantly in the intercropped system. NO3-N accumulation in the soil after the winter wheat and maize harvests decreased by 29.7 kg N ha(-1) and 47.9 kg N ha(-1) in the fertilized intercropped system, respectively, compared to the fertilized sole-crop system, while the grain yield of intercropped maize decreased by 31.3% and 33.7% for the fertilized and nonfertilized treatments, respectively. Water use efficiency (WUE) decreased by 38.5% and 40.7%, respectively. These results indicate that poplar tree roots play a significant role in alleviating NO3-N accumulation in the soil profile due to more NO3-N uptake in the intercropped system. However, they severely influenced maize grain yield and WUE. Thus, young poplar trees can be introduced into wheat fields. However, it is impractical to introduce them into a wheat and maize rotation system, in view of sustainable agriculture and environmental protection.

AB Remarkable preclinical progress and achievements in the isolation and characterization of stem cells from different sources have been made, together with the ability to control proliferation and differentiation in vitro. Researchers and physicians pin their hope on stem cells to develop novel approaches in regenerative medicine. Stem cell therapy is no longer a scientific discipline in the laboratory or in animal models only, as it is already performed routinely in the human therapeutical and clinical treatment for hematological malignancies and clinical trials for bone repair. It has further been recognized that angiogenesis plays a pivotal role for the successful transplantation of in vitro engineered tissues like bone structures, for the repair of large bone defects to facilitate engraftment. We intended to generate transplantable composite grafts, which consist of in vitro generated bone tissue from multipotent adult progenitor cells, maintaining an angiogenic potential to ease and optimize a successful engraftment of long-term sustainable and viable bone tissue. The other component was generated from several synthetically produced three-dimensional tissues like fibrin, thrombin, collagen, hydroxyapatite, and beta-tricalciumphosphate in different compositions and concentrations, all mimicking natural body structures of bone tissue as biocompatible grafts. We established an in vitro mouse model, using bone marrow and peripheral blood-derived murine progenitor cells as well as industrially manufactured materials generating composite grafts. Based on our preliminary results, we propose to pursue research on composite grafts for an extended graft survival and successful engraftment of transplanted tissue.

TI Can human rights discourse improve the health of Indigenous Australians?
SO AUSTRALIAN AND NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
ID PUBLIC-HEALTH; EQUITY; LAW; RECONCILIATION
AB Objective: Recognition of the poor health outcomes of Indigenous Australians has led to an interest in using human rights discourse as a framework for arguing that the Australian Government has an international obligation to improve Indigenous health.
   Method: This paper explores two potential directions for human rights discourse in this context. The first is the development and elaboration of an asserted 'human right to health'. The second focuses on developing an understanding of the interactions between health and human rights, particularly the underlying social determinants of health, and thereby creating an advocacy framework that could be used to promote the inclusion of human rights considerations into the policy-making agenda.
   Results: This paper argues that despite the symbolic force of human rights discourse, its capacity to improve the health of Indigenous Australians through international law is limited. This is so irrespective of whether recourse is made to a legal or moral imperative.
   Conclusion and Implications: The 'human right to health' is limited primarily by several barriers to its implementation, some of which are perpetuated by the current Australian Government itself. Although the potential advocacy capacity of human rights discourse is similarly limited by the hostility of the Government towards the notion of incorporating human rights considerations into its public policy decision making, it does provide a sustainable intellectual framework in which to consider the social and structural determinants of health and maintain these issues on the political agenda.

AB Control of late blight by alternative products is important for reduction of fungicide inputs and potato production costs. The efficacy of essential oils and biopesticides for inhibition of growth of Phytophthora infestans on media and suppression of late blight on potato plants in growth chambers was examined. Growth of pathogen isolates of diverse genotypes was evaluated on Rye B media amended with essential oils (lavender, thyme, thyme borneal, and oregano) and the biopesticide Serenade (Bacillus subtilis strain QST 713). Over 90% inhibition of pathogen growth was achieved with oregano and Serenade amendments. The protective foliar application of Serenade, an aerated compost tea (ACT), Effective Microorganism mix (EM), and oregano, resulted in disease suppression of 5-40% relative to the untreated control. ACT had no significant suppressive effects (0-15% reduction), EM resulted in mild suppression (15-30% reduction), and oregano and Serenade consistently resulted in moderate disease reduction (20-40%). No oil or biological treatment produced disease control comparable to the chemical control chlorothalonil, which resulted in disease reductions of 80-98%. Both oregano and Serenade resulted in some phytotoxicity at high doses. These results suggest that the natural products and biological amendments tested are not sufficient for effective late blight control by themselves; however, when used in combination with other established disease control practices, these approaches may contribute to improved, integrated, and more sustainable management options for late blight.

AB Over the last few decades wild population of Chitala chitala (HamiltonBuchanan) has been declined more than 50% due to various reasons and is presently listed under endangered (EN) category due to reduced abundance. In the present communication wild C. chitala were collected from natural habitats and induced to spawn under captivity during July 2002 by injecting three different doses of synthetic hormone Ovaprim. Intramuscular injections were administered to fishes using three different doses (1.5, 1.0 and 0.5 ml/kg body weight). Artificial breeding pool was prepared for each set by encircling area (20 x 5 m) with mosquito net, where wooden country boat (8 x 4 x 2.5 feet with surface area 48.5 sq. feet) was placed inside the breeding pool. Distinct spawning behavior was noticed in the experimental sets with different hormonal dose whereas no spawning activity was noticed in control set. The fertilization rate varied from 48.86-80.2% and total numbers of spawned eggs in two sets of experiments were estimated to be 81,034. The average number of eggs deposited 15 +/- 2.1/square inches. The fertilized eggs were large in size (4.5 +/- 0.05 mm), adhesive and attached to the hard substratum. The eggs hatch out between 168192 h after fertilization and about 33,639 hatchlings were produced. Newly hatched larvae measured 10.23 +/- 0.03 mm and 0.031 +/- 0.008 gm in weight and the mean diameter of yolk sac was 4.1 +/- 0.08 mm. The yolk sac remains attached up to a week. The percentage survival of hatchlings varied from 42.2 to 65.60. Statistical analysis was worked out to determine the relation between the hormone dosage with different breeding parameters like latency period, fertilization rate, egg output, hatching rate and hatchling production.

AB Habitat loss and hunting are currently the twin threats to wildlife across the world. Hunting is such a threat across the tropics that some recent studies have estimated wildlife extraction at six times the sustainable rate in parts of Africa. The traditional methods of wildlife hunting, like setting traps and snares are no longer sustainable as the reasons for hunting are largely moving from subsistence to commercial.
   We assessed the spatial patterns of snaring activities against target species distribution, habitat types, distance from park border and security patrol efforts using a stratified random sampling design in Tsavo West National Park. Tsavo is not only the largest park in Kenya, but also one that faces an enormous threat from poachers. The finding indicated that the seven strata surveyed had different wildlife density and snaring intensity. Areas of the park adjacent to highways, trans-national borders, ranches and town strata had high wildlife snaring pressure. There was a significant difference between snare size and habitat type but total numbers of snares across habitats were not significantly different. The total wildlife species encountered were influenced by habitat types. Regression analysis between snare density and security patrol effort did not show any trend. There was no significant difference in snare density as the distance increased from the park border. Conservation agencies and volunteer patrol teams specialising in snare collection should intensify their patrol efforts in areas of the park around highways, trans-national borders, ranches and town.

AB In order to be effective, information must be placed in the proper context and organized in a manner that is logical and (preferably) standardized. Recently, invasive alien species (IAS) scientists have begun to create online networks to share their information concerning IAS prevention and control. At a special networking session at the Beijing International Symposium on Biological Invasions, an online Eastern Asia-North American IAS Information Network (EA-NA Network) was proposed. To prepare for the development of this network, and to provide models for other regional collaborations, we compare four examples of global, regional, and national online IAS information networks: the Global Invasive Species Information Network, the Invasives Information Network of the Inter-American Biodiversity Information Network, the Chinese Species Information System, and the Invasive Species Information Node of the US National Biological Information Infrastructure. We conclude that IAS networks require a common goal, dedicated leaders, effective communication, and broad endorsement, in order to obtain sustainable, long-term funding and long-term stability. They need to start small, use the experience of other networks, partner with others, and showcase benefits. Global integration and synergy among invasive species networks will succeed with contributions from both the top-down and the bottom-up.

AB The long-term field experiments were initiated in 2001 on five sites in Zhejiang province of China to monitor the impacts of non-flooded plastic mulching management on rice soil microbial biomass for sustainable agro-ecosystem. The three treatments were plastic film mulching with no flooding (PM), no plastic film mulching and no flooding (UM), and the traditional flooding management (TF). Microbial biomass C accounted for 0.3-2.4% of the soil total organic C, microbial biomass N for 0.79-4.3% of the soil total N, and microbial biomass P for 0.1-1.6% of the soil total P. Three years of non-flooded plastic film mulching reduced microbial biomass C and N and increased microbial biomass P in rice soil.

AB Wood fuel is a strategic resource for future energy supply and is usually utilised locally. Traditional use of wood fuel and other bioenergy has a share of 10-15% energy supply, used mainly for the household sector. The utilisation for industrial purposes is much smaller but is a strategic resource in the effort to fulfil the Kyoto agreement to replace fossil fuels and to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. Many industrialised countries already use a significant share of biofuels in their energy supply e.g. Nordic countries while others like some other European Union countries are planning to increase their use. Production and use of biofuels need to be carried out sustainable. Official statistics do not report trade in such detail that international trade in different biomass types can be fully identified. However, FAO and European Forestry Institute are important sources. In some countries, there is a growing interest in the international trade, because the trade can provide biofuels at lower prices, larger quantities and better quality than domestic alternatives. The first signs of an international market price for wood fuel are indicated in Europe. For the future both the use and the trade of wood fuel is expected to increase. Analyses for trade in charcoal, wood chips, fuel wood and wood residues made in this report identify 'hot' trade spots in Europe, in south East Asia and in North America. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

ID COLLAPSE; STOCKS
AB The history of orange roughy (Hoplostethus atlanticus) stocks, primarily in New Zealand and Australia, is commonly used as an example of the inability to manage fisheries resources. We review the history and status of the New Zealand orange roughy fishery and show that the total loss of potential biological yield from overfishing is no more than 8.3% (1260 tonnes (t)center dot year(-1)) of the potential yield. The losses from underfishing are estimated to be 810 t center dot year(-1). We consider the biological and economic consequences of alternative management approaches to the New Zealand orange roughy fishery. We suggest that given the uncertainty in stock abundance and productivity and market and processing capacity limits, the management of New Zealand orange roughy stocks has been close to economically optimal and has produced near maximum sustainable yield from the resource.

TI The fisheries management implications of maternal-age-dependent larval
   survival
SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
ID SIZE; FECUNDITY; VIABILITY; GROWTH; RATES; EGGS; FISH
AB A common goal of conventional fisheries management is to maintain fishing mortality at a rate that ensures an adequate level of lifetime egg production (LEP) for population sustainability. However, larvae from young spawners can experience higher mortality rates than larvae of older spawners, reducing the effect of egg production by young females (hereafter, maternal age effects). This reduction leads to an error in LEP that can be accounted for by reducing the fishing mortality rate, but raises the question of the magnitude of these errors if they are present but not accounted for. Calculations using parameters from a typical long-lived fish demonstrated that maternal age effects resulted in large errors in estimates of lifetime reproduction when there was a large contrast in the larval mortality rate extending over the reproductive life span. Errors were small when maternal age effects reduced the reproductive potential of only the very youngest spawners, at ages when a small fraction of females are mature. A specific example using the empirically derived maternal age effect for black rockfish (Sebastes melanops) indicated that errors in traditional management would be small for this species.

AB Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are multipurpose organisms with complex ecological ramifications in the soil system that have been difficult to study and understand. The phytocentric concept of AMF that has prevailed since the naming of these organisms is being replaced by a holistic vision recognizing that AMF are a key element of soil functioning and health rather than a plant root component. Recent advances in knowledge brought about by new techniques for soil microbiology research open the way to AMF management in crop production. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi may influence crop development, even in phosphorus-rich soils. However, growing crops in soil with lower fertility would optimize the expression of the multiple beneficial effects of AMF in agro-ecosystem and reduce nutrient seepage to the environment. The consideration of the soil mycorrhizal potential within the framework of soil testing and fertilization recommendations, the development of improved inoculants and signal molecules to manipulate AMF and the development of cultivars with improved symbiotic qualities would insure the production of good crop yields while improving agroecosystems' sustainability.

AB Renewed interest in Camelina sativa is primarily due to the unique fatty acid profile of the seed oil and its potential value in industry, cosmetics and human nutrition. To exploit C. sativa in western Canada, more information is needed on the performance of this crop in this region. Following a preliminary evaluation in 2001, replicated agronomic trials were conducted in 2002 and 2005 with 19 C. sativa and three oilseed Brassica accessions at Saskatoon and Scott, Saskatchewan and Beaverlodge, Alberta. The C. sativa accessions matured relatively early and were more tolerant of drought and flea beetle infestations than the Brassica oilseeds. Some C. sativa accessions had seed yields competitive with those of the Brassica oilseeds, but seed size was significantly smaller. Seed yields and oil contents of all crop species tested were highest at Beaverlodge, the most northern location. The Brassica oilseeds generally had higher oil contents than C sativa; the highest oil contents of each crop species tested were associated with the lowest protein contents. In general, average oil and protein contents for C. sativa ranged from 38 to 43% and from 27 to 32%, respectively; for the Brassica checks, oil and protein contents ranged from 38 to 53% and from 21 to 33%, respectively, across all species. Variation in fatty acid composition was higher among the C. sativa accessions than among locations, but overall the ranges of individual fatty acids were relatively narrow. The most abundant fatty acids were oleic (12.8-14.7%), linoleic (16.3-17.2%), linolenic (36.2-39.4%) and eicosenoic (14.0-15.5%). The prospects of developing improved C. sativa germplasm for particular western Canadian environments are good; of primary importance are increased seed size and oil content. Additionally, stand establishment, fertility requirements and broadleaf weed control options need to be investigated. Acceptance of this species as a new oilseed crop for western Canada will also require developing sustainable markets for the oil and meal.

AB Aims: StEP TWO is a school- and family-based intervention consisting of extra lessons, healthy nutrition and physical education for overweight and obese children in primary schools, aimed at reducing body mass index by maintenance or reduction of weight, and improving motor abilities. We analysed differences in changes in anthropometric, cardiovascular and obesity parameters between children who underwent intervention, non-participants in intervention, and controls. Methods: Anthropometric data and waist circumference were recorded for 1678 children; body mass index and body mass index-standard deviation score were calculated. Blood pressure was measured after 5 minutes at rest. 121 overweight and obese children enrolled at 3 schools involved in programmes of intervention were invited to take part; 40 of them completed the programme from November 2003 to July 2004. Of these overweight children, 74 were invited, but did not take part. As controls, we enrolled 155 overweight and obese children from 4 other schools. Results: After the programme, the children involved in intervention showed a lower increase in the body mass index (0-3 plus or minus 1.3 versus 0.7 plus or minus 1.2 kilograms per metre squared) and an approximately three times higher diminution of the body mass index-standard deviation score in comparison with their controls (-0.15 plus or minus 0.26 versus 0.05 plus or minus 0.27). Systolic blood pressure was significantly lowered by 9.5 plus or minus 19.6 millimetres of mercury in those involved in intervention, but increased in the control group by 0.5 plus or minus 16.5 millimetres of mercury. Among those invited but not participating, the increase of the body mass index (0.5 plus or minus 1.3 kilograms per metre squared) was less, and the reduction of the body mass index-standard deviation score (-0.09 plus or minus 0.31) and systolic blood pressure (-5.3 plus or minus 15.6 millimetres of mercury) was higher than in the control group. Overweight but not obese children seem to benefit from a screening examination alone. Conclusions: Early preventive measures in schools are necessary and effective for overweight and obese primary school children. The screening itself seems also to have a minor positive effect, especially for overweight children. Sustainability of the observed improvements over a longer period remains to be confirmed.

DT Article
DE Black sea; Georgia; Kubitskali river; Paliastomi lake; pollution
AB The aim of the present study was to examine the distribution of pollutants in two coastal systems in Georgia: (1) Kubitskali river which flows into the Black sea through the city of Batumi and is polluted mainly from the effluents of an oil refinery; (2) Paliastomi lake, which is a shallow water body at the south-east of the city of Poti. During 2000-2001, two samplings took place in each system, one in the low-flow period and one in the high-flow period. During these samplings, pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen, and salinity were measured in situ, whereas water samples were collected for the analysis of trace metals, nutrients, and organic pollutants with standard methods. The results of the measurements indicate the significant pollution of both systems by ammonia and in the case of Kubitskali River also by oil products. The need for a sustainable management plan of the activities taking place in the river basin is urgent.

TI Redeveloping former military sites: Competitiveness, urban
   sustainability and public participation
SO CITIES
LA English
DT Article
DE urban sustainability; participation; brownfield regeneration; military
   land conversion; military base redevelopment
AB Redevelopment activities on former bases include new housing developments, industrial, training, educational and recreational facilities alongside retail and commercial quarters. This paper elaborates on the American roots and the rationale of military base redevelopment as one example of brownfield regeneration by adopting a comparative analysis using examples from the United Kingdom, Germany and Jordan to highlight experiences, lessons learnt and potential further study. In the UK, the policy to redevelop military land is driven by need to reduce government spending, income generation and promoting government targets for brownfield housing development. In the Jordanian case, the examination of available sources indicates that although development on military sites has been promoted by a political commitment to 'sustainable' urban regeneration, economic self-interest appears to triumph over environmental and community concerns in the conversion process. This has generally been developer driven. In sharp contrast to this, the case of Vauban in Germany clearly demonstrates how community activism can play a central role in redeveloping a military site. The paper goes on to argue that the challenge in military base redevelopment, like other brownfield sites, will be to guarantee competitive advantages through revenue-generating activities that can transform these sites into reliable economic opportunities while looking after the interests of all the parties involved.

TI Sustainability challenges in the geoduck clam fishery of British
   Columbia: Policy perspectives
SO COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE British Columbia; geoduck clams; property rights; IVQ; co-management and
   sustainability
AB The geoduck clam fishery, worth approximately CDN $40 million(1) in annual landed value, is British Columbia's most valuable invertebrate fishery. This fishery has been co-managed by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) and the Underwater Harvesters Association (UHA) since 1989. Earlier input control measures such as effort regulation, seasonal closures, and licenses failed to work effectively for more than ten years, resulting in excess fishing capacity, over harvesting, poor economic returns, and unsafe fishing practices. Output control measures such as the individual vessel quota system (IVQ) have, to some extent, proven successful in improving revenues, controlling excess fishing capacity, gaining compliance with regulations, and involving fishers in the joint decision-making processes. However, there are public concerns about a common property resource at risk of being dominated by a few UHA license holders. Additionally, there are concerns about the job losses resulting from IVQ implementation, as well as distribution and equity issues. This article traces and examines the policy context for fisheries management in the British Columbia (BC) geoduck fishery, discusses the major concerns surrounding the exploitation of long lived Methuselah's clams and concludes with areas for further research in sustaining this lucrative fishery.

ID CONSERVATION; SCIENCE
AB Although numerous principles have been identified as being important for successfully integrating social and ecological factors in collaborative management, few authors have illustrated how these principles are used and why they are effective. On the basis of a review of the ecosystem management and collaboration literature, we identified eight factors important for integrative, collaborative ecosystem management-integrated and balanced goals inclusive public involvement, stakeholder influence, consensus group approach, collaborative stewardship, monitoring and adaptive management, multidisciplinary data, and economic incentives, We examined four cases of successful ecosystem management to illustrate bow the factors were incorporated and discuss the role they played in each case's success. The cases illustrate that balancing social and ecosystem sustainability goals is possible. Collaborative efforts resulted in part from factors aimed at making plans economically feasible and from meaningful stakeholder participation in ongoing management It also required participation in monitoring programs to ensure stakeholder interests were protected and management efforts were focused on agreed-upon goals. Data collection efforts were not all-inclusive and systematic; rather, they addressed the ecological, economic, and social aspects of key issues as they emerged over time. Economic considerations appear to be broader than simply providing economic incentives; stakeholders seem willing to trade some economic value for recreational or environmental benefits. The cases demonstrate that it is not idealistic to believe integrative, collaborative ecosystem management is possible infield applications.

AB Assemblage structures and distribution patterns of larval fishes and paralarval cephalopods were examined in September 1998 at Great Meteor Seamount, an isolated seamount located in the subtropical eastern North Atlantic. Early life stages of fish (n = 18555) and cephalopods (n = 1200) were collected at 23 stations with a multiple opening-closing net, in seven discrete depth strata from 290 m depth (close to the seamount plateau) to the surface. Oceanic species dominated in both taxonomic groups. A peak in diversity was observed at an intermediate depth, in the 100-150 m water layer. Direct and indirect gradient analyses showed distinct species assemblages in the upper and lower part of the water column, separated by approximately 150 m. The division was statistically significant, although a considerable overlap between species was also observed. Above the summit, vertical gaps were found in the distributions of the deeper assemblages, likely caused by increased predation pressure by benthopelagic fish. Horizontal distribution patterns of fish and cephalopods were similar and corresponded to the structure of closed circulation cells detected above the flanks and the flat plateau area. Fish assemblages were significantly different between the inner and outer seamount regime, which was approximately separated by the 1500 m depth contour. Differences in the taxonomic composition of cephalopods were less pronounced; for only one cephalopod species could a direct association with the seamount be assumed. The study indicates a significant retention potential at the seamount that facilitates local recruitment of resident stocks and generates self-sustainable populations isolated from the continental shelf and oceanic islands.

AB Due to shortage of rainfall and its increasing variability, moisture stress is identified to be one of the most critical factors affecting agricultural productivity in the drylands of Ethiopia. To circumvent this problem, a strategy of supplemental irrigation through surface water harvesting was adopted by the government and several micro-dams have been built in the semi-arid parts of the country. However, the benefits from the water harvesting schemes are not sustainable because of rapid water storage loss due to siltation. There is, therefore, an urgent need for improved catchment-based erosion control and sediment management strategies. The design and implementation of such strategies require data on the rate and magnitude of sediment deposition. To this end, reservoir surveys were conducted to estimate sediment deposition rate for 11 reservoirs identified to be representative of catchments in the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia. Two approaches were employed during the survey: one was based on measurement of sediment thickness in reservoirs while the other was based on comparing the original and existing topography of the reservoir-beds. The average annual sediment yield estimated for the study sites was about 19 t ha(-1) y(-1). An equation of the type SSY = 3(.)36A(0.61) (with SSY = area specific sediment yield in t ha(-1) y(-1) and A = catchment area in km(2)) was also established for the study region, which is opposite to the 'universal' SSYA relationship. In order to improve the sediment yield predictive capability of A, it was integrated with a factorial index that assesses the catchment's propensity to erosion and potential sediment yield. The effect of accelerated sediment deposition on water storage loss of reservoirs and possible controlling factors of the SSY-A relationship are outlined. The potential semi-quantitative scoring approach to characterize catchments in terms of erosion sensitivity and the significance of the A-index approach to predict SSY of similar catchments are also highlighted.

AB Caribou are an integral component of high-latitude ecosystems and represent a major subsistence food source for many northern people. The availability and quality of winter habitat is critical to sustain these caribou populations. Caribou commonly use older spruce woodlands with adequate terrestrial lichen, a preferred winter forage, in the understory. Changes in climate and fire regime pose a significant threat to the long-term sustainability of this important winter habitat. Computer simulations performed with a spatially explicit vegetation succession model (ALFRESCO) indicate that changes in the frequency and extent of fire in interior Alaska may substantially impact the abundance and quality of winter habitat for caribou. We modeled four different fire scenarios and tracked the frequency, extent, and spatial distribution of the simulated fires and associated changes to vegetation composition and distribution. Our results suggest that shorter fire frequencies (i.e., less time between recurring fires) on the winter range of the Nelchina caribou herd in eastern interior Alaska will result in large decreases of available winter habitat, relative to that currently available, in both the short and long term. A 30% shortening of the fire frequency resulted in a 3.5-fold increase in the area burned annually and an associated 41% decrease in the amount of spruce-lichen forest found on the landscape. More importantly, simulations with more frequent fires produced a relatively immature forest age structure, compared to that which currently exists; with few stands older than 100 years. This age structure is at the lower limits of stand age classes preferred by caribou from the Nelchina herd. Projected changes in fire regime due to climate warming and/or additional prescribed burning could substantially alter the winter habitat of caribou in interior Alaska and lead to changes in winter range use and/or population dynamics.

   STRATEGY
AB Translocation, the intentional release of captive-propagated and/or wild-caught animals into the wild in an attempt to establish, reestablish, or augment a population, is a commonly used approach to species conservation. Despite the frequent mention of translocation as an aid in threatened or endangered species recovery plans, translocations have resulted in the establishment of few sustainable populations. To improve the effectiveness of translocation efforts, it is essential to identify and adopt features that contribute to successful translocations. This study analyzed 148 translocations of the endangered Gila topminnow (Poeciliopsis occidentalis) to identify various factors that have significantly influenced translocation success. We quantified success as the "persistence time" of translocated populations and used survival analysis to interpret the role of several factors. The following factors affected persistence times of translocated populations: season in which the fish were translocated, habitat type of the translocation site, and genetic origin of the fish stocked. In general, factors associated with stocking, the population stocked, and the site of translocation can significantly affect the persistence of translocated populations and thus increase the probability of translocation success. For Gila topminnow, future translocations should be undertaken in late summer or fall (not early summer), should occur into ponds (not streams, wells, or tanks), and should generally utilize individuals from genetic lineages other than Monkey Spring. For other species, a key lesson emerging from this work is that life history attributes for each translocated species need to be considered carefully.

AB Robust predictions of competitive interactions among canopy trees and variation in tree growth along environmental gradients represent key challenges for the management of mixed-species, uneven-aged forests. We analyzed the effects of competition on tree growth along environmental gradients for eight of the most common tree species in southern New England and southeastern New York using forest inventory and analysis (FIA) data, information theoretic decision criteria, and multi-model inference to evaluate models. The suite of models estimated growth of individual trees as a species-specific function of average potential diameter growth, tree diameter at breast height, local environmental conditions, and crowding by neighboring trees. We used ordination based on the relative basal area of species to generate a measure of site conditions in each plot. Two ordination axes were consistent with variation in species abundance along moisture and fertility gradients. Estimated potential growth varied along at least one of these axes for six of the eight species; peak relative abundance of less shade-tolerant species was in all cases displaced away from sites where they showed maximum potential growth. Our crowding functions estimate the strength of competitive effects of neighbors; only one species showed support for the hypothesis that all species of competitors have equivalent effects on growth. The relative weight of evidence (Akaike weights) for the best models varied from a low of 0.207 for Fraxinus americana to 0.747 for Quercus rubra. In such cases, model averaging provides a more robust platform for prediction than that based solely on the best model. We show that predictions based on the selected best models dramatically overestimated differences between species relative to predictions based on the averaged set of models.

AB Despite growing concerns about overexploitation of sharks, lack of accurate, species-specific harvest data often hampers quantitative stock assessment. In such cases, trade studies can provide insights into exploitation unavailable from traditional monitoring. We applied Bayesian statistical methods to trade data in combination with genetic identification to estimate by species, the annual number of globally traded shark fins, the most commercially valuable product from a group of species often unrecorded in harvest statistics. Our results provide the first fishery-independent estimate of the scale of shark catches worldwide and indicate that shark biomass in the fin trade is three to four times higher than shark catch figures reported in the only global data base. Comparison of our estimates to approximated stock assessment reference points for one of the most commonly traded species, blue shark, suggests that current trade volumes in numbers of sharks are close to or possibly exceeding the maximum sustainable yield levels.

AB Drawing upon research from a cluster and innovation systems perspective, we counter the argument that the food industry is a mature and dying industry and point to evidence of a vibrant, dynamic food sector that has made a substantial contribution to regional growth. Since the mid-1990s, the most dynamic component of the Toronto urban food economy has been the small- and medium-sized enterprises, comprised mainly of specialty, local, ethnic, and organic food-processing firms that are thriving in response to consumers' demands for high-quality, local, fresh ethnic and fusion cuisine. However, these newer firms face challenges, and our results raise the question about how a more stimulating innovative milieu can be created for them. In answer to this question, we suggest multiscaled approaches to cluster formation and policy and discuss the implications of our research for theories of innovation systems, firms, city creativity, and governance. We situate this "new food economy" within the core literature of economic geography, seeking to relocate the "agrifood" literature away from a traditional rural setting to a dynamic city-region context, underscoring the essential role of the consumption side of agrifood chains. Moreover, we use the food sector as a lens through which to argue that mature sectors and "ordinary" activities in a city are every bit as important to the long-term health, viability, and sustainability of a city-region economy.

AB Global warming (GW) is now recognized as a significant threat to sustainable development on an international scale. After providing some introductory background material, we introduce a benchmark dynamic game within which to study the GW problem. The model allows for population growth and is subsequently generalized to allow for changes in technology. In each case, a benchmark "Business as Usual" (BAU) equilibrium is analyzed and contrasted with the efficient solution. Furthermore, a complete characterization is provided in the benchmark model of the entire subgame perfect equilibrium value correspondence.

TI The political economy of redistribution under democracy
SO ECONOMIC THEORY

DT Article

ID GROWTH
AB We ask what redistributions of income and assets are feasible in a democracy, given the initial assets and their distribution. The question is motivated by the possibility that if redistribution is insufficient for the poor or excessive for the rich, they may turn against democracy. In turn, if no redistribution simultaneously satisfies the poor and the wealthy, democracy cannot be sustained. Hence, the corollary question concerns the conditions under which democracy is sustainable. We find that democracies survive in wealthy societies. Conditional on the initial income distribution and the capacity of the poor and the wealthy to overthrow democracy, each country has a threshold of capital stock above which democracy survives. This threshold is lower when the distribution of initial endowments is more equal and when the revolutionary prowess of these groups is lower. Yet in poor unequal countries there exist no redistribution scheme which would be accepted both by the poor and the wealthy. Hence, democracy cannot survive. As endowments increase, redistribution schemes that satisfy both the poor and the wealthy emerge. Moreover, as capital stock grows the wealthy tolerate more and the poor less redistribution, so that the set of feasible redistributions becomes larger. Since the median voter prefers one such scheme to the dictatorship of either group, democracy survives.

ID OPTIMAL-GROWTH; CONVEX
AB This paper studies a one-sector optimal growth model with linear utility in which the production function is only required to be increasing and upper semicontinuous. The model also allows for a general form of irreversible investment. We show that every optimal capital path is strictly monotone until it reaches a steady state; further, it either converges to zero, or reaches a positive steady state in finite time and possibly jumps among different steady states afterwards. We establish conditions for extinction (convergence to zero), survival (boundedness away from zero), and the existence of a critical capital stock below which extinction is possible and above which survival is ensured. These conditions generalize those known for the case of S-shaped production functions. We also show that as the discount factor approaches one, optimal paths converge to a small neighborhood of the capital stock that maximizes sustainable consumption.

   configuration; sharing
AB It has been pointed out that if the social configuration of the three relations (market, communal, and obligatory relations) is not balanced, a market-based society as a total system fails. Using multiagent simulations, this paper shows that a sustainable society is formed when all three relations are integrated and function appropriately.
   When agent trades are based on the market mechanism (i.e., agents act in their own interest and thus only market relations exist), weak agents who cannot perform transactions die. If a compulsory tax is imposed to enable all weak agents to survive (i.e., obligatory relations exist), then the fiscal deficit increases.
   On the other hand, if agents who have excess income undertake the unselfish action of distributing their surplus to the weak agents (i.e., communal relations exist), then the trade volume increases. It is shown that the existence of unselfish agents is necessary for the realization of a sustainable society.
   The survival of all agents, however, is difficult in a communal society. In an artificial society, for all agents to survive and fiscal balance to be maintained, all three social relations must be fully integrated. These results show that adjusting the balance of the three social relations will lead to the realization of a sustainable society. (C) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB The global problems facing the future of sustainable development after the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg in September 2002 were at the center of attention at the Club of Rome Meeting in Ankara in October 2002. Here we discuss some of the scenarios presented at the Ankara Meeting, taking into account the situation after the recent Iraq crisis. The development of South East European countries and some of their neighbours is presented through several socio-economic indicators. The second part of the contribution is connected with the implications of the above development indicators for Croatia and Slovenia. The time dependence of some of these indicators for these two countries is presented and discussed. Countries in general face a combined problem of assuring simultaneously economic development and sustainability. All these processes have their scientific and technological, but also a political dimension, and it is frequently through the political dimension that different interests and conflicts hinder sustainable development. Comprehensive sustainable development requires research and technological development and an appropriate educational system establishing thereby a knowledge-based society. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The emergence of the "sustainable development" concept as a response to the mining of natural resources for the benefit of multinational corporations has advanced the cause of long-term environmental management. A sustainable development model (SDM) framework that is inclusive of the "whole" natural environment is presented to illustrate the integration of the sustainable development of the "whole" ecosystem. The ecosystem approach is an inclusive framework that covers the natural environment relevant futures and constraints. These are dynamically interconnected and constitute the determinates of resources development component of the SDM. The second component of the SDM framework is the resources development patterns, i.e., the use of land, water, and atmospheric resources. All of these patterns include practices that utilize environmental resources to achieve a predefined outcome producing waste and by products that require disposal into the environment. The water quality management practices represent the third component of the framework. These practices are governed by standards, limitations and available disposal means subject to quantity and quality permits. These interconnected standards, practices and permits shape the resulting environmental quality of the ecosystem under consideration. A fourth component, environmental indicators, of the SDM framework provides a measure of the ecosystem productivity and status that may differ based on societal values and culture. The four components of the SDM are interwoven into an outcome assessment process to form the management and feedback models. The concept of Sustainable Development is expressed in the management model as an objective function subject to desired constraints imposing the required bounds for achieving ecosystem sustainability. The development of the objective function and constrains requires monetary values for ecosystem functions, resources development activities and environmental cost. The feedback model ensures policy and resources use changes required for sustainability. An iterative process would be required to define the optimum ecosystem development plan that satisfies sustainable outcome. (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

DE cogeneration; sustainability assessment; multi-criteria analysis
AB The effective and rational energy generation and supply is one of the main presumptions of sustainable development. Combined heat and power production, or co-generation, has clear environmental advantages by increasing energy efficiency and decreasing carbon emissions. However, higher investment cost and more complicated design and maintenance sometimes-present disadvantages from the economical viability point of view. As in the case of most of economies in transition in Central and Eastern Europe, Croatia has a strong but not very efficient co-generation sector, delivering 12% of the final energy consumption. District heating systems in the country's capital Zagreb and in city of Osijek represent the large share of the overall co-generation capacity. Besides district heating, co-generation in industry sector is also relatively well developed. The paper presents an attempt to assess the sustainability of Croatian co-generation sector future development. The sustainability assessment requires multi-criteria assessment of specific scenarios to be taken into consideration. In this respect three scenarios of Croatian co-generation sector future development are taken into consideration and for each of them environmental, social and economic sustainability indicators are defined and calculated. The assessment of complex relationships between environmental, social and economic aspects of the system is based on the multi-criteria decision-making procedure. The sustainability assessment is based on the General Sustainability Index rating for different cases reflecting different criteria and their priority. The method of sustainability assessment is applied to the Croatian co-generation sector contributing to the evaluation of different strategies and definition of a foundation for policy related to the sustainable future cogeneration sector development.

AB Climate change response, including the implementation of the Kyoto targets as the first step, calls for technological innovation of future sustainable energy systems. Based on the Danish case, this paper evaluates the type of technological change necessary. During a period of 30 years, Denmark managed to stabilize primary energy supply, and CO2 emissions decreased by 10%, during a period of 20 years. However, after the introduction of the Kyoto Mechanisms, Denmark has changed its strategy. Instead of continuing the domestic CO2 emission controls, Denmark plans to buy CO2 reductions in other countries. Consequently, the innovative technological development has changed. This paper evaluates the character of such change and makes preliminary recommendations for policies to encourage the use of the Kyoto Mechanisms as an acceleration of the necessary technological innovation.

AB The present research is based on a survey sent to large medium and small size companies, located in Portugal and within what are considered the most pollutant industrial sectors. The analyses of the results, processed with the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) 11.0, show that generally companies are concerned with the implementation of clean processes, green products and eco-equipment to have a cleaner environment, i.e. a more sustainable society. Statistically, the results show that the 98 potential polluting companies are moderately contributing for a green society (x(m) = 3.1) regarding the ten environmental strategies under research. It can also be concluded that, globally, environmental strategies are directly linked to the companies' size. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Recycled wood has two important functions for sustainable development, as an industrial resource and as a means of longer storage of fixed carbon from carbon dioxide by photosynthesis. Recycled wood-based board, such as medium density fiberboard (MDF), is treated to produce a base material of floor heating system. The concept of functionally graded material (FGM) is introduced for the design of energy saving wood-based board. The heat transfer phenomenon of an FGM base plate used in a floor heating system is modeled and analyzed. The basic equation of the unsteady two-dimensional heat transfer problem and the analytical method for an FGM plate with wood material properties are proposed. The analytical method consists of the Laplace transformation and the perturbation method for arbitrary grading patterns. The results of the numerical calculation suggest that the optimum FGM wood-based board can save more energy than the homogeneous material. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Watershed management is dedicated to solving watershed problems on a sustainable basis. Managing watershed development on a sustainable basis usually entails a balance between the needs of humans and nature, both in the present and in the future. From a watershed or water resources development basis, these problems can be classified into five general categories: lack of water quantity, deterioration in water quality, ecological impacts, weak public participation, and weak economic value. The first three categories can be combined to make up physical sustainability while the last two categories can be defined as social and economic sustainability. Therefore, integrated watershed management should be designed to achieve physical sustainability utilizing, to the greatest extent possible, public participation in an economically viable manner. This study demonstrates an innovative approach using scientific, social, and motivational feasibilities that can be used to improve watershed management. Scientific feasibility is tied to the nature of environmental problems and the scientific means to solve them. Social feasibility is associated with public participation. Motivational feasibility is related to economic stimulation for the stakeholders to take actions. The ecological impacts, lack of water quantity and deterioration in water quality are problems that need scientific means in order to improve watershed health. However, the implementation of these means is typically not achievable without the right public participation. In addition, public participation is typically accelerated by economic motivation for the stakeholders to use the resources in a manner that improves watershed health. The Big Lost River in south-central Idaho has been used as an illustration for implementing scientific, social and motivational feasibilities and in a manner that can achieve sustainability relative to water resources management. However, the same approach can be used elsewhere after appropriate modifications. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE LWR; FBR; reprocessing; uranium removal; recycle material
AB The transition from light water reactors (LWR) to fast breeder reactors (FBR) is indispensable for sustainable nuclear electricity supply but has various Unpredictable factors such as introduction speed and time of FBR. In order to manage these unpredictable factors. the authors propose advanced fuel cycle system which consists of LWR spent fuel reprocessing (uranium removal) and FBR spent fuel reprocessing and fabrication. LWR fuel reprocessing only carries out about 90% uranium removal from LWR spent fuel. then the composition of remaining spent fuel (recycle material) is about 50% uranium, 15% plutonium and 35% fission products + minor actinides. Recycle material is transferred to FBR spent fuel reprocessing to recover plutonium and uranium followed by mixed Oxide (MOX) fuel fabrication for FBR. Depending on the introduction time of FBR. recycle material (about 1/10 volume of original LWR spent fuel) may be stored until the construction of FBR. The proposed fuel cycle system called "flexible fuel cycle initiative (FFC1)'' has some characteristics compared with ordinary (reference) system which consists of full reprocessing facilities of LWR and FBR spent fuels. that is smaller LWR reprocessing facility, higher plutonium content in recycle material for FBR. compact storage volume Of recycle material with high proliferation resistance in case of FBR introduction delay. By the evaluation of several transition scenarios from LWR to FBR. the FFC1 system was clarified to supply enough and no surplus plutonium for FBR. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The world's energy system is at least a 1.5 trillion dollars market dominated by fossil fuels, where small changes can have a large influence on efforts to reach sustainability. Renewable energy sources are key to achieving this goal. Excluding traditional biomass, in 2001 renewables represented 4.4% of primary energy consumption, unevenly distributed between developed and developing countries. Environmental problems at local, regional and global levels, as well as external dependency and security of supply will persist if we rely on an energy future based on fossil fuels. Solutions encompass extending the life of fossil fuel reserves and expanding the share of renewable in the world energy system through top down and bottom up policies, described in this paper.

AB Security of energy supply and climate change are central concerns for policy makers and important dimensions of the long-term quest for a sustainable global energy system. This paper examines the role of several policy instruments in managing energy security and climate risks and stimulating technological change towards a more secure and climate-benign global energy system in the long-term future. The analysis has been conducted with ERIS, a multi-regional energy-systems "bottom-up" optimization model with technology learning. Our analysis provides some policy insights and identifies synergies and trade-offs relating to the potential for security of supply policies to promote the uptake of new technologies, reduce the cost of pursuing climate change mitigation policies, and facilitate a possible transition to a hydrogen economy.

SO ENERGY POLICY

DE energy intensity; communist legacies; economies in transition
AB The fall of communism left some of the most polluting and wasteful energy sectors of the World in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). After 15 years of restructuring, eight of these countries have joined the European Union (EU), closing an era of economic transitions. What progress has been made in these countries in the field of energy from the perspective of sustainability? Has the transition agenda been completed, or do any of the socialist energy sector legacies prevail?
   The purpose of this paper is to review the period of economic transition in the energy sector, focusing on sustainability, in three selected CEE countries, and to use Russia as a comparison. First, the paper argues that at the core of the unsustainability of energy sectors at the end of the communist era were among the highest energy intensities in the world. Then, we identify the legacies of the centrally planned economy that contributed to these high-energy intensities. We outline a policy agenda for the transitions which addresses the identified legacies. Next, we look at the energy landscape at the end of the restructuring, and review the developments in energy intensities during the period of economic transitions. We conclude that, while energy and economic restructuring is very important to bring down the high-energy intensities of former communist countries, a sizeable gap remains in intensity levels between CEE countries and the old EU states. Therefore, economic and energy system reforms alone will not close the gap, and targeted policies and measures are needed to improve energy efficiency levels. Beyond a more serious governmental commitment, a concerted effort is needed from regulators, corporations, utilities, consumer organisations and the civil sector to catalyse the remaining progress to be made in combating the socialist legacy in the field of energy efficiency.

AB Energy is often known as the catalyst for development. Globally, the per capita consumption of energy is often used as a barometer to measure the level of economic development in a particular country. Realizing the importance of energy as a vital component in economic and social development, the government of Malaysia has been continuously reviewing its energy policy to ensure long-term reliability and security of energy supply. Concentrated efforts are being undertaken to ensure the sustainability of energy resources, both depletable and renewable. The aim of this paper is to describe the various energy policies adopted in Malaysia to ensure long-term reliability and security of energy supply. The role of both, non-renewable and renewable sources of energy in the current Five-Fuel Diversification Strategy energy mix will also be discussed. Apart from that, this paper will also describe the various alternative energy and the implementation of energy efficiency program in Malaysia. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This article is about a new approach in robotic learning systems. It provides a method to use a real-world device that operates in realtime, controlled through a simulated recurrent spiking neural network for robotic experiments. A randomly generated network is used as the main computational unit. Only the weights of the output units of this network are changed during training. It will be shown, that this simple type of a biological realistic spiking neural network-also known as a neural microcircuit-is able to imitate robot controllers like that incorporated in Braitenberg vehicles. A more non-linear type controller is imitated in a further experiment. In a different series of experiments that involve temporal memory reported in Burgsteiner et al. [2005. In: Proceedings of the 18th International Conference IEA/AIE. Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence. Springer, Berlin, pp. 121-130.] this approach also provided a basis for a movement prediction task. The results suggest that a neural microcircuit with a simple learning rule can be used as a sustainable robot controller for experiments in computational motor control. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The food industry has always been a major generator of economic activity in the Greater Toronto Area. However, recently the innovative and creative elements of the industry have changed. Since the mid-1990s, the fastest growing segment within the industry has been small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The specialty, ethnic, and organic SMEs (hereinafter referred to as the 'creative-food' industry) appear to be particularly innovative as they respond to consumer demand for local, fresh, ethnic, and fusion cuisine. On the basis of sixty-five interviews with food producers, processors, restaurateurs, food media, non-government organizations, government, and private sector agencies, it is suggested that this creative-food sector is thriving despite existing public policies that bias toward large-scale, industrialized agri-food firms in the region. As such, a disconnect currently exists between on the one hand, the traditional agrifood paradigm that the government regulatory environment is promoting and, on the other hand, the locally consumer-driven food cluster that is emerging. Public policies of multiculturalism and education have done more to facilitate the unprecedented growth of this creative subcomponent of the food sector than have explicit public food-policy initiatives. However, there is still room for policy initiatives that advance the development of this dynamic sector, especially in the area of supportive infrastructure, access to health-based ethnically appropriate food, food education, and fair labour standards. Contrary to a widely held view, the creative-food industry is not just about promoting exclusive foods for the pleasure of urban elite. Rather, it offers an opportunity for a more socially inclusive and sustainable urban development model. The findings also have implications for multilevel governance in cluster formation and policy, future research on food, as well as for theories on innovation, urban creativity, and governance.

AB This paper explores the relations between different forms of knowledge and urban environmental policy arenas. It briefly considers the evolution of the urban environmental agenda and growing interest in questions of knowledge transfer. It then explores reasons for an apparent knowledge-policy 'gap', including familiar explanations, such as the problems of communicating research findings, as well as those based on more subtle and complex interpretations of both knowledge and policy processes. It concludes with some proposals for thinking about the boundary between knowledge and policy and constructive ways to enhance the sustainable urban environment agenda. The paper introduces the other contributions in this theme issue-concerned with diverse aspects of knowledge transfer in the context of urban environments-and draws upon insights from a seminar series at which these papers were first presented.

TI Designing urban knowledge: competing perspectives on energy and
   buildings
SO ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING C-GOVERNMENT AND POLICY
LA English
DT Article
ID CONSERVATION; POLICY; DIFFERENCE; INNOVATION; EFFICIENCY
AB The author engages with debates about buildings, energy efficiency, and the innovation process-issues that are of great significance for urban sustainability because buildings are such an important constituent of urban energy consumption. Within this context, the author explores what it might mean to develop an interdisciplinary understanding of technical change. Questioning conventional accounts, he develops a sociotechnical perspective on competing energy knowledges and contexts of design, development, and consumption. It is argued that energy research and policy-making for the built environment is underpinned by a common understanding of technical change, which fails to take account of the contextual nature of energy-related choice. Describing cultural, organisational, and commercial factors shaping technological innovation, the author explores how more-or-less energy-efficient choices influencing urban development are made in response to changing opportunities and practices which sometimes favor energy efficiency, sometimes not. The author draws upon sociological accounts of technical change and illustrates both a sociotechnical perspective on energy and buildings and a key role for sociologists in the field of architecture, energy, and environmental studies.

AB In this paper I argue that environmental policy research could benefit from developing an understanding of how the concepts of 'scale', 'scalar strategies', and 'struggles over scale' play out empirically in processes of environmental policymaking and planning. I emphasise how scale, as an issue in environmental governance, is not merely an independent variable causing specific outcomes; rather, it is negotiable, allowing actors to adopt different strategies in order to pursue their varying agendas. I show how a local struggle can be represented as a global struggle: a case study concerning the domestic use of natural gas in the Norwegian city of Stavanger, and how this metamorphosed into a struggle about what was the appropriate geographical scale at which the environmental and climatic consequences of a natural gas project should be assessed, is described. By framing climate change as a global issue, local actors were able to portray the natural gas project as environmentally friendly. I argue that the realisation of this natural gas project should be seen in light of how strategies over scale-which were developed in the debate-fitted with climate discourses institutionalised in national policy and politics.

AB Cities are growing inexorably, causing many to think that inevitably their environmental impact will worsen. In this paper, three approaches to understanding the environmental impact of cities are analyzed, namely population impact, Ecological Footprint and sustainability assessment. Although the population impact model provides some perspective on local impact, and the Ecological Footprint model on global impact, only the sustainability assessment approach allows us to see the positive benefits of urban growth and provides policy options that can help cities reduce their local and global impact while improving their liveability and opportunity, which continue to drive their growth. This approach is then applied in the city of Sydney.

AB This paper describes how ten municipalities within the Ayuquila river basin in Mexico formed a collaborative association to reduce river pollution and, more generally, to work together to improve living conditions and promote more sustainable management of natural resources within and across their administrative boundaries. It describes the improvements achieved and discusses the institutional arrangements for this association, including the involvement of local universities and state- and federal-level institutions, and provision for citizen participation. It also discusses the measures taken to ensure the association's continued effectiveness, especially ensuring support from municipal politicians (who only have three-year terms of office), strengthening municipal-level technical capacity and what is needed to ensure the association's effectiveness in the future.

LA English

DE ecological design; sustainable development; sustainable urban
   development; sustainability
AB Urban development strategies that aim to eradicate poverty will only be successful if these strategies include ecological sustainability criteria relating to sanitation, solid waste removal, energy, building materials and food security.((1)) This paper uses the Lynedoch EcoVillage development in Stellenbosch (near Cape Town) to demonstrate that this can result in a balance between growth, equity and sustainability without any one of these criteria being seen as less or more important. In practice, however, judgments need to be made, and original intentions are often thwarted by conditions as they emerge during the course of the development process. Lynedoch EcoVillage is a significant case because it is the first intentional, socially mixed ecologically designed urban development in the South African context. To this extent, the Lynedoch Development is a challenge to both the traditional unsustainable approaches to urban design and infrastructure that have dominated the democratic period in South Africa since 1994, and to the perpetuation of economic apartheid whereby the rich and poor have remained segregated.

ID COPRODUCTION
AB Using the results of a comparative three-year research project in five metropolitan areas, this article reviews a range of practices in accessing water and sanitation by peri-urban poor residents and producers. It starts from the observation that neither centralized supply policies nor the market through, for example, large-scale profit-making enterprises are able to meet their needs. Although they are consumers insofar as they have no option but to pay market prices for water (and often for sanitation), the peri-urban poor are, in practice, sometimes regarded as citizens with basic entitlements such as the right to water. This article outlines a conceptual distinction between "policy-driven" and "needs-driven" practices in the access to peri-urban water and sanitation services. The case studies show that this access is mainly needs-driven and informal rather than the result of formal policies. The key to structural improvements in water and sanitation lies in the recognition of these practices and their articulation to the formal system under new governance regimes.

DT Article
DE colonial; history; sanitation; technology; urban; water
AB This paper describes the evolution of the piped water and sewer system in Kampala, Uganda, between 1920 and 1950, and considers the influences this had on the city's later development. Large-scale systems for water and sanitation are associated with an inertia that makes them slow to adapt to a new economic, social or environmental context. It is important to know the history of such systems in order to understand issues of sustainability today. This article shows how the piped water and sewerage systems were introduced to serve mainly the more affluent groups in society. Although the systems were economically and socially sustainable in the colonial context, inherent features of the systems made universal service coverage problematic from an economic point of view. Policy makers need to acknowledge the historic influence and the inertia of systems in order to address current shortcomings in water and sanitation provision, and create sustainable and equitable service provision.

AB This paper reviews the failure of conventional transport policies to address the many problems caused by private car use in cities in high-income nations, and suggests that restructuring parking provision can address these problems. It discusses how increasing car use has not produced more trips per day, and increasing speed has not increased leisure time, because of congestion and increased travel distances. Transport planning that provides parking spaces for car owners at their homes, workplaces, shopping centres and recreational places has supported increased private car use. Not only does this make people car drivers but its effect also restructures cities so that shop, workplace, recreational and social contacts within neighbourhoods disappear, city landscapes become remodeled for cars, and public transport becomes unviable. Meanwhile, car-oriented city streets discourage walking. This paper suggests that these problems can be solved if strong incentives are provided for cars to be parked in garages that are only as accessible as public transport stops - at all origins and destinations.

AB DNA strand breaks [as determined by the conventional and formamidopyrimidine glycosylase (FPG)-modified Comet assay] and antioxidant defense status [as indicated by superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and reduced glutathione (GSH) concentration] were evaluated in healthy adult chub (Leuciscus cepholus) after exhaustive exercise [swimming to their critical swimming speed (U-crit), twice in succession with a 40 min rest period between] vs. confined (unexercised) control fish. The conventional Comet assay revealed significantly higher DNA strand breaks in all the tissues (blood, liver, and gill), with the highest increase over background evident in the epithelial gill cells of swum fish compared to the controls. Moreover, when the FPG-modified Comet assay was conducted to reveal specific oxidative lesions, the gill cells of exercised fish sustained the highest level of oxidative DNA damage in comparison to the control. Data on tissue antioxidant defense mechanism were less conclusive, with no significant differences in the tissue levels of SOD or GSH. This suggests that either the degree of oxidative stress was not great enough to evoke a response in terms of defense mechanisms or the timescale of antioxidant defense response was somewhat different from the time between the application of stress and subsequent tissue sampling. From the swimming data, U-crit was significantly lower on the second assessment compared to the first (repeat ratio: 0.76), suggesting that the fish were exercised to a level which was not sustainable. Overall, these findings support the theory that acute extreme exercise could result in oxidative stress and associated DNA damage in fish. These observations suggest that fish living in fast flowing and polluted rivers are at increased risk of DNA damage.

AB The 'Landscapes of Settlement Project' has carried out archaeological and paleoenvironmental research in the Lake Myvatn region of N. Iceland since 1996. Animal bone collections dating from the late 9th century to the early 13th century AD have been recovered from five sites in different ecological zones around the lake, and three of these sites provide multiple phases datable through radiocarbon, artefacts, and volcanic tephra. Modern systematic biological and geological investigations in the Myvatn district date to the 19th century and a detailed picture of the recent ecology can be combined with both archaeological and historical evidence for long term resource exploitation by humans in this inland region. Analysis of bird bones and bird eggshell suggests that the locally managed sustainable harvest of migratory waterfowl eggs carried out over the last 150 years extends back to the 9th century. These inland archaeofauna also include significant numbers of marine fish and sea birds, marine mollusca, and a few seal and porpoise bones. Marine fish remains recovered indicate specialised transport of partial skeletons missing most cranial and some thoracic vertebrae, suggesting that a cured fish product was being regularly brought to inland farms during the early years of the settlement. Inter-regional exchange and a pre-Hanseatic artisanal fish trade prior to AD 1000 suggests the importance of preserved marine fish in early Scandinavian economies, and may shed light on the source of the 11th century 'fish event horizon' recently documented in southern Britain.

AB BACKGROUND: Community-based research often involves additional ethical, legal, and social considerations beyond those of the specific individuals involved in the study. The traditional institutional review board (IRB) typically focuses on protecting the rights and ensuring the safety of the individuals involved. For projects involving community members, IRBs should be more sensitive to issues related to the broader community concerns.
   OBJECTIVES: The objective of this article is to discuss the concept of community-based participatory research and the shortcomings of the traditional IRBs in dealing with ethical issues associated with broader community concerns such as implications for family members, neighborhood groups, and local businesses. I examine the rationale and benefits for expanding the roles and responsibilities of review boards related to community-based issues.
   DISCUSSION: I propose the development of environmental health and community review boards (EHCRBs) that combine the fundamental responsibilities and ethical concept of the traditional review boards with an expanded ethical construct of dignity, veracity, sustainability, and justice, with an added emphasis on community.
   CONCLUSIONS: Only by acknowledging the needs of and working with the community can we ensure ethically based and socially responsible research. An EHCRB will allow researchers and community members to more fully address their mutual interest in conducting scientific, ethical, and socially responsible research.

AB Solid waste management (SWM) is at the forefront of environmental concerns in the Lower Rio Grande Valley (LRGV), South Texas. The complexity in SWM drives area decision makers to look for innovative and forward-looking solutions to address various waste management options. In decision analysis, it is not uncommon for decision makers to go by an option that may minimize the maximum regret when some determinant factors are vague, ambiguous, or unclear. This article presents an innovative optimization model using the grey mini-max regret (GMMR) integer programming algorithm to outline an optimal regional coordination of solid waste routing and possible landfill/incinerator construction under an uncertain environment. The LRGV is an ideal location to apply the GMMR model for SWM planning because of its constant urban expansion, dwindling landfill space, and insufficient data availability signifying the planning uncertainty combined with vagueness in decision-making. The results give local decision makers hedged sets of options that consider various forms of systematic and event-based uncertainty. By extending the dimension of decision-making, this may lead to identifying a variety of beneficial solutions with efficient waste routing and facility siting for the time frame of 2005 through 2010 in LRGV. The results show the ability of the GMMR model to open insightful scenario planning that can handle situational and data-driven uncertainty in a way that was previously unavailable. Research findings also indicate that the large capital investment of incineration facilities makes such an option less competitive among municipal options for landfills. It is evident that the investment from a municipal standpoint is out of the question, but possible public-private partnerships may alleviate this obstacle.

AB Environmental indicator systems are a fundamental tool in quantifying the environmental component of sustainable development. They are useful because they quantify the status and trends of key environmental parameters and provide information on the environment that allows authorities and communities to make informed decisions. This article analyzes the basic framework for Chinese environmental indicator systems and presents a "core" set of environmental indicators. In our research, we used a theme approach to develop the environmental indicator systems. We performed two case studies of selected indicators. In the first, we used an urban ambient air pollution composite index and an urban ambient air pollution indicator for three main pollutants to examine trends in urban air pollution in China from 1990 to 2000 at regional and national levels. The results indicate that China has made some progress towards controlling urban air pollution, but must do more in order to reach acceptable pollution levels. We think that an aggregated index and disaggregated indicators have important complementary roles in the policy-making processes. In the second case study, we developed and constructed a grassland degradation index that aggregates information on the extent and severity of grassland degradation. Taking the Xilinhaote region of Inner Mongolia as the study area, we calculated this index by combining remote-sensing data, a geographical information system (GIS), and field investigation. Based on these results, we provide recommendations regarding further development and measurement of environmental indicators in China.

ID ISSUES
AB A conceptual model of sustainable forest management is described based on three connected and necessary components: Policy/Strategic Planning, Operational Planning, and EffectivenessMonitoring/Science.
   Alberta's proposed Forest Management Planning Standard is described as an example of operational planning. The standard utilizes coarse and fine filter approaches to conserving biodiversity and sets requirements for implementation monitoring.
   The Alberta Biodiversity Monitoring Program (ABMP) is described as an example of effectiveness monitoring supporting Operational Planning. The ABMP is a rigorous science-based initiative that is being developed to monitor and report on biodiversity status and trends throughout the province of Alberta, Canada. The basic survey design consists of 1656 sites, 20 km apart, evenly spaced on a grid pattern across Alberta. Sites will be sampled over a five-year period at a rate of 350 sites/year. Standardized sampling protocols will be used to cover a broad range of species and habitat elements within terrestrial and aquatic environments, as well as broader landscape-level features.
   Trends and associations detected by ABMP products will be validated through cause-effect research. ABMP focuses research on critical issues and informs both operational planning and the development of policy and strategic-level plans. The Alberta Forest Management Planning Standard and the ABMP are described as key components to implementing resource planning based on ecosystem management principles.

AB ']Background, Aims and Scope. In a previous study, we explored the use of acetate, lactate, molasses, Hydrogen Release Compound (HRC (R), which is based on a biodegradable poly-lactate ester), methanol and ethanol as carbon source and electron donor to promote bacterial sulfate reduction in batch experiments, this with regards to applying an in situ metal precipitation (ISMP) process as a remediation tool to treat heavy metal contaminated groundwater at the site of a nonferrous metal work company. Based on the results of these batch tests, column experiments were conducted with lactate, molasses and HRC (R) as the next step in our preliminary study for a go-no go decision for dimensioning an on site application of the ISMP process that applies the activity of the endogenous population of sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB). Special attention was given to the sustainability of the metal precipitation process under circumstances of changing chemical oxygen demand (COD) to [SO42-] ratios or disrupted substrate supply.
   Methods. To optimize the ISMP process, an insight is needed in the composition and activity of the indigenous SRB community, as well as information on the way its composition and activity are affected by process conditions such as the added type of C-source/electron donor, or the presence of other prokaryotes (e.g. fermenting bacteria, methane producing Archaea, acetogens). Therefore, the biological sulfate reduction process in the column experiments was evaluated by combining classical analytical methods [measuring heavy metal concentration, SO42- -concentration, pH, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) with molecular methods [denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) fingerprinting and phylogenetic sequence analysis] based on either the 16S rRNA-gene or the dsr (dissimilatory sulfite reductase) gene, the latter being a specific biomarker for SRB.
   Results and Discussion. All carbon sources tested promoted SRB activity, which resulted within 8 weeks in a drastic reduction of the sulfate and heavy metal contents in the column effluents. However, unexpected temporal decreases in the efficiency of the ISMP process, accompanied by the release of precipitated metals, were observed for most conditions tested. The most dramatic observation of the failing ISMP process was observed within 12 weeks for the molasses amended column. Subsequent lowering the COD/SO42- ratio from 1.9 to 0.4 did not alter the outcome of sulfate reduction and metal precipitation efficiency in this set-up. Remarkably, after 6 months of inactivity, bacterial sulfate reduction was recovered in the molasses set up when the original COD/SO42- ratio of 1.9 was applied again. Intentional disruption of the lactate and HRC (R) supplies resulted in an immediate stagnation of the ISMP processes and in a rapid release of precipitated metals into the column effluents. However, the ISMP process could be restored after substrate amendment. 16S rDNA-based DGGE analysis revealed that the SRB population, in accordance with the results of the previously performed batch experiments, consisted exclusively of members of the genus Desulfosporosinus. The community of Archaea was characterized by sequencing amplicons of archaeal and methanogen-specific PCR reactions. This approach only revealed the presence of non-thermophilic Crenarchaeota, a novel group of organisms which is only distantly related to methane producing Euryarchaeota. DGGE on the dsrB genes was successfully used to link the results of the ISMP process to the community composition of the sulfate reducing bacteria.
   Conclusions. In the case of an intentional disruption of substrate supply, the. ISMP process failed most likely because the growth and activity of the indigenous SRB community stopped due to a lack of a carbon and electron donor. On the other hand, the cause of the sudden temporal shortcomings of the ISMP process in the presence of different substrates was not immediately clear. It was first thought to be the result of competition between methanogenic prokaryotes (MP) and sulfate reducers, since the formation of small amounts of CH4 (0.01-0.03 ppm ml(-1)) was detected. However, the results of molecular analyzes indicate that methanogens do not constitute a major fraction of the microbial communities that were enriched in the column experiments. Therefore, we postulate that the SRB population becomes inhibited by the formed metal sulfides.
   Recommendation and Perspective. Our results indicate that the ISMP process is highly dependent on SRB-stimulation by substrate amendments and suggest that this remedial approach might not be viable for long-term application unless substrate amendments are continued and environmental conditions are strictly controlled. This will include the removal of affected aquifer material from the metal precipitation zone at the end of the remediation process, or removal of metal precipitates when the microbial activity decreases. Additional tests are necessary to investigate what will happen when clear groundwater passes through the reactive zone while no more C-sources are amended and all indigenous carbon is consumed. Also, the effects of dramatic increases in sulfate- or HM-concentrations on the SRB-community and the concomitant ISMP process need to be studied in more detail.

AB Scope and Background. Contamination of soils, aquifers and groundwater by nonaqueous phase liquid (NAPL) pollutants constitutes a major environmental issue of concern, worldwide. The residual (biodegradation-resistant) hydrophobic fuel hydrocarbons entrapped in the soil porous matrix, possess a particular bioremediation challenge due to their becoming virtually immobile, nor desorbable, or water dispersible. Consequently, they are not available as substrates to the micro-organism-based biodegradation.
   Materials and Methods. Our research involves the development of economically feasible, surfactant/surfactant-nutrient mix (SSNM) - enhanced bioremediation methodologies for sustainable, in situ bioremediation of fuel-contaminated aquifers. This requires, methodologically, (a) the optimization, via in vitro 'flow' (columns) lab experiments and screening processes, of an effective mixture for the intended SSNM-enhanced bioremediation; and (b) the study of the combined effect of the optimized SSNM on the solubilization/mobilization and biodegradation of NAPL (fuel) in in vitro site/aquifer-simulated bioremediation.
   Results and Discussion. The essence of our findings: (1) kerosene's maximum enhanced mobilization - f = 3.6, compared with that of deionized water, was achieved with an SSNM having the composition of linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (LABS): coco-amphodiacetate (containing N): surfactant-nutrient X (containing both N and P) = 0.15: 0.15: 0.05 g/L, respectively; (2) 62-64% of the initial amount of kerosene in the initially saturated soil matrix, 'packed' in a column, has been eluted from it during similar to 30 days, compared with 68% of kerosene biodegradation in 'vessel' settings, in 21 days.
   Conclusions. (1) The indigenous microorganisms present in the vadose zones of fuel-contaminated sandy soil aquifers are potentially capable of unassisted removal of similar to 80% of the initially contained fuel (kerosene), during a period of about 42 days; (2) the major effects of the SSNM addition are (a) enhanced mobilization of the bulky NAPL; and (b) enhanced desorbtion/ solubilization/dispersion of the entrapped NAPL which, in turn, facilitate their enhanced biodegradation.
   Recommendations and Perspective. Our findings suggest that pre-optimized, biodegradable SSNM is essential for surfactants based bioremediation of NAPL-contaminated aquifers, in order to make this in-situ methodology both technologically and economically feasible.

   the EU Council's position on authorisation within REACH

AB Background. Preparation of the new European REACH (Registration, Evaluation and Authorisation of CHemicals) regulation on chemicals has reached a critical stage. Depending on how key elements of the legislative proposal are finalised, especially that on authorisation of uses of 'substances of very high concern', REACH could either provide an effective measure to drive innovation towards cleaner and safer alternatives, or instead lead to further avoidable chemical exposures on the basis of demonstrated 'adequate control' of risks. Given that some key indicators of human and wildlife reproductive health continue to decline in parts of Europe, while evidence for chemical exposure as a contributory factor grows, it will clearly be vital to get the legislation right.
   Goal and Scope. Whereas there is now a consensus between the European Parliament and Council of the European Union that uses of persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic (PBT) and very persistent and very bioaccumulative (vPvB) substances should only be permitted when no safer alternatives are available, major differences remain regarding the manner in which other 'substances of very high concern' (including substances which are carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic to reproduction (CMRs) and endocrine disruptors) are addressed. This paper examines those differences in more detail and proposes some ways forward.
   Methods. Using case studies of specific chemicals as examples, the paper critically evaluates the concepts of 'effect thresholds' and 'adequate control' of risks, which underpin the Council's proposal for many CMRs and endocrine disruptors.
   Results. The subjectivity and uncertainties inherent in the threshold approach proposed by the Council, as illustrated by these case examples, bring its ability to ensure a high level of protection for the environment and human health into question: i. the nature and extent of toxic effects recorded depend on many different factors, including the type of test and conditions selected, the organisms exposed, the timing of exposure and precisely which effects are measured and over what timeframe. ii. doses considerably below 'no effect levels' for survival could nevertheless be causing significant impairment to health and/or reproductive success. iii. chemicals present in mixtures at levels below established thresholds for effects may, in combination, induce significant toxicological responses.
   Discussion. Under the Council's current proposal, companies will be granted authorisations for some uses of CMRs and endocrine disruptors, even if safer alternatives without these properties are already on the market. The high level of evidence required for identification of substances as being of equivalent concern represents an additional weakness in the Council approach.
   Conclusions. Instead, a requirement (along the lines of the Parliament's proposals) to address the availability of alternatives in all cases, to use them when available and to initiate their development when not, represents a more robust, defensible and protective approach to the management of 'substances of very high concern'. The possibility for authorisation of essential uses would remain, while all avoidable uses and exposures would progressively be prevented and sustainable innovation supported.
   Perspectives. In the long run, this can only lead to a more sustainable future for the chemical industry in Europe, as well as delivering benefits of increased protection for our environment and health for generations to come.

AB Some of the challenges to establishing and sustaining environmental monitoring are potentially overcome under the framework of global observing systems. Observing systems go beyond monitoring by enabling links between user needs and observations and by providing valued information products to user groups at appropriate spatial and temporal scales. The United Nations established three global observing systems; for climate, oceans, and land and freshwater. Initiatives have also begun to address important issues within coastal ecosystems. Recent socio-political awareness and technical advances have improved the opportunities for establishing these observing systems and ensuring their sustainability. Awareness and current technology alone are not enough, and ongoing implementation of these systems is still stymied by a variety of factors. We make several recommendations to promote their success now and in the future.

AB The phytoplankton and zooplankton assemblages in the Guadiana estuary (south Portugal) were compared in two contrasting hydrologic years, characterized by high and low freshwater discharges. Changes in salinity, nutrients and turbidity, which were mainly due to the changes in freshwater input, had an important influence on the structure of the planktonic assemblages. Nevertheless, coastal upwelling can also influence the productivity of the lower estuarine area during short periods both in winter and in summer. In 2000, a short-term freshwater pulse during May (average 126.46 m(3) s(-1)) was markedly beneficial; phytoplanktonic diversity increased, and this caused an increase in zooplanktonic diversity. As phyto-zooplankton coupling in these systems is an important regulator of processes in the trophic web, changes in the dominant groups can have consequences on water quality, especially on the occurrence of toxic plankton blooms. Modelling simulations indicate that a day discharge of 50 m(3) s(-1), every week during critical periods, such as summer/autumn, could be enough to avoid cyanobacteria blooms. Since freshwater "pulses" can be managed by operating the freshwater release from hydrotechnical structures, understanding the relationships between the periodicity and magnitude of inflow pulse events and the estuarine ecosystem structure and healthy functioning is a crucial step towards the development of management modelling tools, as proposed in this study.

AB Climate and human impact on terrestrial sediment flux, nutrient and pollutant delivery to the coastal zone in the Algarve can be clearly demonstrated with both past and recent examples. A Holocene period of high sediment input, supporting a depositional coastal response to relative sea-level rise, has now given way to a period of coastal retreat where increased damming of rivers has led to reduced river flow and terrestrial sediment input. These changes in water and sediment budget are coupled with increased nutrient and pollutant influx associated with agriculture and industrial/urban development. Solutions to these problems may only be addressed through integrated river basin management, and with ecohydrological principles playing a critical role in the development and routine use of sustainable management techniques. Whilst riparian wetlands and saltmarshes are recognised as ecohydrological management tools with which to regulate hydrology, sedimentation, nutrient status and pollutant sequestration and the conservation of biodiversity, the same is not true of perimarine wetlands that occupy the transition zone between catchment and sea. Evidence from Holocene examples of estuarine and back-barrier perimarine wetlands in the UK suggests that they are well adjusted to the conditions of high relative sea-level rise (3-6 mm yr(-1)) and low terrestrial sediment supply. Whilst Holocene examples in Portugal are sparse, the present conditions of reduced sediment input due to damming and enhanced relative sea-level rise due to Greenhouse warming now makes perimarine wetlands a viable coastal management option. Here, the benefits and practical aspects of perimarine wetland development are considered with a view to establishing a demonstration pilot project in the Guadiana. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Maize production in Malalawi is limited by high costs and sub-optimal use of chemical fertilizers under Continuous cultivation. A long-term gliricidia/maize trial was undertaken oil a Ferric Lixisol from 1991/92 to 2001/02. The purpose of the study was to assess the performance of a gliricidia/maize intercropping system as a low-input soil fertility replenishment option in southern Malawi. The experiment was a 2 x 3 x 3 factorial design with three replications. Treatments included two maize cropping systems (with and without gliricidia trees), and three rates of inorganic N fertilizer (0, 24 and 48 N kg ha(-1) representing 0.25 and 50% of the national recommended N rate), and three rates of P fertilizer application (0, 20 and 40 P ha(-1) representing 0, 50 and 100% of the recommended rate). No effect of P was detected on yield call\, in the trial, and this treatment was discontinued. The gliricidia pruning biomass did not decline after 10 ycars of intensive pruning, with strong correlation between tree biomass production and years after establishment (r = 0.91,p < 0.001). Application of gliricidia prunings increased maize yields by three times compared to the yield of unfertilized sole maize. Maize yield from the unfertilized gliricidia pruning treatment was superior to the yield from sole maize supplemented with a quarter or half the recommended N rate. The study confirmed that a gliricidia/maize intercropping system is a promising soil fertility replenishment option ill Southern Malawi and elsewhere in Southern Africa.

TI Exploring farmers' innovativeness: Experiences with the adaptation of
   water-saving technologies for small-scale vegetable production around
   Marsabit Mountain in northern Kenya
SO EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
AB Over 90 % of the farmers around Marsabit Mountain, a pocket of arable land amidst a predominantly and area in northern Kenya, are former pastoralists, unfamiliar with productive and sustainable farming technologies. This paper describes how encouraging farmer innovativeness enhanced adoption and adaptation of water-saving technologies to suit individual farmers' needs. When farmers understood the principles behind a technology, they were more likely to adapt it. Both men and women farmers were most interested in increasing their available income through improved technologies, but more women than men ranked labour saving as an important attribute of a new technology. More women adopted the new technologies, but men used them on a larger area than women. The paper also shows that agricultural productivity can substantially increase even if the theoretical full potential of the recommended practices might not be achieved. It is concluded that farmers need to be exposed to new ideas in exciting and thought provoking ways to tap their innovation potential.

AB Both intensification and diversification of cropping systems may allow improving the productivity and sustainability of agricultural production in the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP), but the choices to be made require integrated assessment of various cropping systems. A field experiment was conducted from 1999 to 2002 on a sandy clay loam (Inceptisol) to evaluate nine predominant cropping systems in West Bengal, India. Productivity, energy use efficiency, and nutrient uptake generally increased with increasing cropping intensity. Positive residual effects of potato and jute on yield and energy output of subsequently grown crops were observed as well as maintenance or improvement of soil properties such as soil organic matter, available P, and available K. The P balance was positive for most systems, except for jute-containing systems. However, negative K balances occurred due to almost complete removal of crop biomass in all systems, suggesting that recommended rates of applied K fertilizer were to low for sustaining soil K supply over the longer term. Cropping systems containing potato had the highest levels of yield, net return, benefit to cost ratio and energy productivity, but energy use efficiency was reduced due to higher energy consumption in these systems. Jute-wheat and jute-rapeseed-rice systems showed high energy use efficiency along with moderate cost and return. Based on economic considerations alone, jute-potato-rice, rice-potato-rice and rice-potato-sesame can be recommended as cropping systems for resource-rich growers in the eastern part of the IGP. Systems such as jute-wheat, rice-wheat and jute-rapeseed-rice appear to be most suitable for small and marginal farmers that cannot afford the large production costs associated with crops such as potato.

AB Regeneration of baldcypress (Taxodium distichum (L.) Rich.) and water tupelo (Nyssa aquatica L.) in swamps of the deltaic plain of the Mississippi River are of major importance for ecosystem sustainability and forest management in the context of regional hydrological changes. Water tupelo often forms prolific sprouts from cut stumps, and baldcypress is one of few conifers to produce stump sprouts capable of becoming full-grown trees. Previous studies have addressed early survival of baldcypress stump sprouts, but have not addressed the likelihood of sprouts becoming an important component of mature stands. We surveyed stands in southeastern Louisiana that were partially logged 10-41 years ago to determine if stump sprouts are an important mechanism of regeneration. At each site we inventoried stumps and measured stump height and diameter, presence and number of sprouts, sprout height, and water depth. We determined age and diameter growth rate for the largest sprout from each stump from increment cores. The majority of stumps did not have surviving sprouts. Baldcypress sprout survival was about the same (median 10%) as previously found for stumps up to 7 years old, so it appears that, although mortality is high soon after sprouting, it is low after age 10. Water tupelo sprouting was rare at our sites but it was not clear whether this may have been because trees were not cut at our sample locations. Baldcypress stump sprouts were more likely to survive on shorter, smaller-diameter stumps, and baldcypress sprout growth was greatest on drier sites with less competition from overstory trees. Surviving baldcypress stump sprouts had high growth rates, but were not regularly spatially distributed within stands and many had advancing decay from stumps into sprouts. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB Clearcut harvesting removes old-forest structure from stands, rendering these habitats unsuitable for tree-dependent mammal species such as North American red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus). Unsuitability of boreal mixedwood forest clearcuts may persist for almost a century, longer than most harvest rotations in this region. In these systems, one alternative to clearcutting is mixedwood understorey protection (MUP) harvesting. MUP harvesting selectively removes mature deciduous canopy trees, retaining some mature and immature trees in the overstorey and understorey, and promoting release of understorey conifers. Live tree retention may also serve to promote early recolonisation by tree squirrels. We compared red squirrel abundance and demography before and after MUP harvest, and between different stand types, in the boreal forest of northern Alberta, Canada. Red squirrels were mark-recaptured in MUP, mixedwood reserve, deciduous, and conifer stands June-July 2001-2003. Red squirrel abundance and masses differed between stand types within years. Abundance and masses did not differ between pre- and post-harvest mixedwood stands across years. Across all stand types, red squirrel abundance was predicted by abundance of spruce trees and fungi. Our results indicate that MUP harvesting retains forest structure required by red squirrels, thus allowing persistence of red squirrel populations; it thus holds promise as a component of the natural disturbance model for maintaining arboreal sciurid populations in managed landscapes.

AB In many fire-dependent forests in the United States, changes occurring in the last century have resulted in overstory structures, conifer densities, down woody structure and understory plant communities that deviate from those described historically. With these changes, many forests are presumed to be unsustainable. Broad-scale treatments are proposed to promote stand development on trajectories toward more sustainable structures. Yet little research to date has identified the effects of these restoration treatments, especially in low elevation dry ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) forests of northeastern Oregon. We report changes in tree structure, coarse woody debris (logs), and understory composition from an operational-scale, replicated (N = 4), completely randomized experiment. Treatments included a single entry thin from below conducted in 1998, a late season burn conducted in 2000, a thin followed by burning (thin + burn), and a no action treatment which served as a control. Changes in live and dead tree structure and understory vascular plant community composition were compared between pre-treatment and 2004. Tree seedling density and composition and coarse woody debris structure were evaluated in 2004. Thin, burn, and thin + burn treatments reduced the density but not the basal area of live overstory trees. Thinning reduced the number of medium-diameter trees, and tended to decrease the abundance of shade tolerant, moist-site understory species yet increased the dominance of several rhizomatous species such as Calamagrostis rubescens, Symphoricarpos albus, and Spiraea betulifolia. Burning alone had little effect on large trees but reduced the number of small Douglas-fir and logs. Shade tolerant perennial species associated with fine textured soils such as S. albus, Spiraea betulifolia, C. rubescens, Carex geyeri, and Arnica cordifolia increased in frequency and average cover with burning. Conversely, cover of the bunch grass Festuca idahoensis was reduced while non-native invasive species establishment was little affected. Ordination scores suggested that burning increased the abundance of species representing greater shade tolerance and finer-textured soils. The thin + burn treatment left both ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir with modal or normal diameter distributions, and increased the abundance of understory species representing shallow, coarse texture soils. These results are discussed in the context of management options for restoration of ecosystem health in similar low elevation dry ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir forests. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB Frequent fire is a feature of the mesic Australian savannas, yet little is known about its effect on tree growth rates. Growth data are critical for the development of demographic models to understand the consequences of different land management regimes. We used generalized linear mixed effects models and information-theoretic multi-model inference to analyse annual diameter growth of adult trees (>= 5 cm diameter at breast height, DBH) and saplings (>= 1.5 m height and < 5 cm DBH) and height growth of juveniles (< 1.5 m height) in response to fire, tree size, stand basal area, annual rainfall, and for adult trees, the presence of the introduced Asian swamp buffalo (a potentially growth-limiting herbivore). The analysis was based on two medium-term datasets from natural eucalypt savanna in Kakadu National Park in the Australian monsoonal tropics. One dataset was based on a 7-year experiment examining the effect of buffalo removal during which three fires occurred, and the second was derived from a 4-year study in which three experimental fire treatments (annual early dry season fire, annual late dry season fire and no fire) were imposed. An unplanned, extremely severe fire burnt some of the previously unburnt trees in the final year of this latter experiment, so we considered it as an additional fire treatment. Despite high variance, there was strong evidence for differential effects of the fire treatments on tree growth, and these effects differed among the three size groups. Late and extreme fires resulted in a high proportion of individuals with negative DBH increments (due to burning or shedding of bark, and also to stems being killed and replaced by small stems), and decreased average DBH growth of saplings (-0.17 and -1.38 cm year(-1), respectively-cf. 0.22 cm year(-1) for no fire) and adult trees (0.01 and 0.03 cm year(-1), respectively-cf. 0.18 cm year(-1) for no fire). Early fires decreased DBH growth of saplings (0.11-cf. 0.22 cm year(-1) for no fire) but increased growth of adult trees (0.29-cf. 0.18 cm year(-1)). Height growth of juvenile trees was reduced by early fires (0.01-cf. 0.06 m year(-1) for no fire) but was increased by late fires (0.10 m year(-1)), probably because juveniles are physiologically active early in the dry season, but are effectively dormant in the late dry season. When stand basal area was high there was evidence of growth suppression in adults, saplings and juveniles. Growth of adult trees was lower in years with high rainfall and where buffalo were removed, possibly because of increased competition from ground layer vegetation. Our study casts doubt on the sustainability of the frequent, early dry season fires that have become a management goal in much of northern Australia. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Rural people worldwide rely on non-timber forest products (NTFP) to generate income to meet livelihood needs. Ecological impacts of harvest are unknown in most cases, despite interest in NTFP for sustainable development and concerns over over-exploitation. Moreover, most studies are <= 2 years in duration, so may not capture long-term harvest impacts or reveal sustainable harvest levels, especially for long-lived species or when impacts are likely to be cumulative. We examined the effects of several leaf harvest regimes on the demography of the understory palm, Chamaedorea radicalis, whose leaves are harvested for use in the international cut-greens industry. From 1999 to 2005, we exposed 100 adult palms to each of five leaf harvest treatments (N = 500): control (no harvest), 1 x (harvest once/year), 2 x (harvest twice/year), 4 x (harvest four times/year), and a modified 4 x treatment (4 x m) where only one leaf was removed per harvest and no palms were completely defoliated. Leaf production, leaf length, palm survival, and reproductive activity were monitored throughout the study. These data were incorporated with demographic data on seeds, seedlings, and juveniles to parameterize stage-based transition matrices for each year x treatment combination to estimate,, the finite rate of population growth. Leaf harvest increased mortality rates, and reduced palm growth and reproductive activity. Three of the harvest treatments reduced; compared to the control treatment, and two of these (2 x, 4 x) significantly below the replacement rate of 1.0. Only in the 4 x m treatment was X not significantly different than the control. No differences in leaf yield were found among the harvest treatments; though yield generally averaged <= 1 leaf per palm per year, it did not decline over the 6 years. Incorporating the price of leaves with leaf yield indicated that income generated per hectare per year ranged from US$7-31. Since the 1 x and 4 x m treatments had yields comparable to more intense harvest treatments with fewer ecological impacts, these treatments could serve as a foundation for the development of sustainable palm harvest and management plans. Harvesting only once per year is the most efficient strategy, as comparable yield is obtained in the fewest days of work. Conservation strategies, such as not harvesting from reproductively active plants, should enhance C. radicalis recruitment, with minimal impact on harvester income. Our findings indicate that sustainable C radicalis harvest can be achieved with few modifications of current harvest practices. In general our conclusions are similar to those based on a two-year intensive study. It is not clear whether these findings apply to other harvested Chamaedorea species, since species differ in life history, habitats, and leaf selection criteria. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB Predicting how timber harvesting will influence sensitive taxa such as amphibians is of critical importance for sustainable management of forests. In 2004 and 2005, we studied the effects of four forestry treatments (clearcut with coarse woody debris [CWD] removed, clearcut with CWD retained, partial-cut of 50% of canopy cover, and an uncut control) on movement, habitat selection, and abundance of amphibians in Maine. Four landscape-scale replicates of these four forestry treatments were created with each replicate centered on a breeding pool. A total of 8632 emerging juvenile wood frogs were captured and marked at drift fences encircling breeding pools, with 1166 marked wood frogs (Rana sylvatica), and 13,727 unmarked amphibians captured in drift fence/pitfall arrays at 16, 50, 100, and 150 m from the pools. Our capture results in the different treatments were consistent with previous studies in showing that adult abundance and habitat use differed among species, with wood frogs, spotted salamanders (Ambystoma maculatum), and eastern red-backed salamanders (Plethodon cinereus) preferring uncut and partial-cut habitat, and adult green frogs (Rana clamitans) and American bullfrogs (Rana catesbeiana) being more tolerant of clearcutting. Spotted salamanders also showed reduced captures with partial canopy removal and increased captures with the retention of CWD. Our results for juvenile amphibians differed from previous research, with lower captures of all study species (statistically significant for seven of nine species) in clearcuts compared to uncut and partial-cut treatments. Clearcuts did not reduce habitat permeability for the low number of marked wood frogs that entered these treatments. Data from marked wood frogs also suggest that both density of conspecifics and habitat quality can influence habitat selection, and potentially dispersal of juvenile amphibians. The avoidance of clearcuts by juveniles of all study species suggests that this silvicultural technique may reduce both abundance and dispersal of many species, rather than just species where adults are known to be forest-dependent. Species may also be affected by partial as well as full canopy removal, and the retention of CWD may play a role in mitigating some of the effects of clearcutting. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB During the past 40 years, the beech bark disease complex has destabilized the beech component of New York State forests, but a selected portion of the American beech (Fagus grandifolia) population has attained a sustainable forest structure. The influence of slope and aspect in relation to beech bark disease on the sustainability of American beech populations was evaluated. There were differences in the proportion of American beech trees with signs of Neonectria spp. and beech scale (Cryptococcus fagisuga) on eastern and western aspects on slopes >= 16%. American beech populations on northern, northeastern, eastern, southeastern, and southern aspects on slopes >= 16% (23-29% of the sample) displayed diameter distributions that would sustain the current forest structure. In all other sites, observed percentage mortality in the large-diameter classes was higher than predicted, suggesting a future shift in forest structure toward lower densities of large trees in these sites.

AB This paper aims to assess the long-term financial sustainability of the Spanish national health system using Generational Accounting, and investigates the effects of several financial options that governments may use to face the challenges posed by the demographic ageing process. Our results indicate, first, that population ageing will have a substantial impact on future health care expenditure, although the examination of past health expenditure trends seems to indicate that ageing is not the main force behind their growth. Second, we find that the policy proposals put forward to date to solve the financial problems of the health system are clearly insufficient to cope with the levels of expenditure predicted for the future.

TI "Steeping" of health expenditure profiles

LA English
DT Article
DE health care expenditure; expenditure profiles; demographics; red herring
ID CARE EXPENDITURE; POPULATION; COSTS
AB If health care expenditure for the elderly grows faster than for younger people, the expenditure profiles become "steeper''-we call that "steeping''. Three instruments for measuring "steeping'' are presented: ( 1) trend of the relation between per capita expenditure of the old and the young; ( 2) comparing the linear slopes of per capita expenditure in age groups; ( 3) trend in parameters of nonlinear modelling of expenditure profiles. Using data of the largest German private health insurer over a period of 18 years, "steeping'' could be observed by all three methods in most examined insurance plans. There are some hints that steeping also occurs in Germany's social health insurance system. The impact of steeping on the sustainability of the health system is discussed. Consequences for the calculation methods in a capital-funded health insurance system and for the implicit inter-generational contract within a pay-as-you-go financed social health insurance system are analysed. The link between "steeping'' and the topic of the "red herring'' discussion is elaborated.

AB The Himalayan Kingdom of Bhutan is in the midst of transformation as it moves from an isolated past to a modern nation-state and participant in the global community. Its development path embraces the concept of "Gross National Happiness," a philosophy and policy instrument that seeks to promote human development and manage environmental conservation within a sustainable strategy guided by Buddhist ethics. After examining Bhutan's approach to development and the governance and environmental policies stemming from it, this essay assesses its impacts on environmental conditions in the country.

AB The Indian health system is mainly funded by out-of-pocket payments. More than 80% of health care expenditure is borne by individual households. Only about 3% of the population, mostly those in the formal sector, benefit from some form of health insurance. Several Indian Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) have initiated Community Health Insurance (CHI) schemes within their existing development programmes. This article describes the principal features of the design and functioning of a selection of 10 CHI schemes and presents a brief overview of the current landscape of CHI in India. The schemes explicitly target the poorest and most vulnerable households in Indian society-scheduled tribes, scheduled castes and poor women. Three CHI management models can be distinguished. The first model consists of local NGOs acting as both insurer and provider. In the second model, the NGO is the insurer but does not itself provide care, which is then purchased from a private provider. In the third model, the NGO neither does provide health care nor acts as an insurer: the NGO, on behalf of a community, links with an insurer and purchases health care from a provider. The benefit packages generally include both primary and secondary care and most of the providers are in the private sector. Most of the schemes require external resources for financial sustainability. There is currently little information on the impact of CHI schemes on the performance of local health systems and more research is warranted in that respect. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Traditional, complementary and alternative medicine (TM/CAM) is globally increasing in popularity. The World Health Organization (WHO) has advocated for the integration of TM/CAM in national public health policies to enhance health care resources. Interest in collaboration between traditional and biomedical health sectors has been renewed in attempts to strengthen control of the AIDS epidemic. However, studies exploring communities' views on the prerequisites for such collaboration are inexistent.
   We conducted 21 focus group discussions with community members in two Zambian urban centres (Ndola and Kabwe) to explore their perspectives on preconditions for useful collaboration between traditional and modern health workers in the management of STIs and HIV/AIDS.
   This study shows that laypersons' perspectives can be rich and inform complex policy issues. Five categories indicating key areas of actions were identified, including protection of traditional medicine and of compensation of healers, education of both groups of providers and adequate community involvement. The respect for some degree of secrecy in traditional medicine was also called for.
   As part of efforts to strengthen available resources for better care of STI/HIV/AIDS, this study provides policymakers, researchers and practitioners with an outline of fundamentals in terms of needed crucial changes at health policy level, among providers and in the community for sustainable collaboration between modern and traditional health practitioners.

AB This paper synthesizes research conducted during the first 5-6 years of the Florida Coastal Everglades Long-Term Ecological Research Program (FCE LTER). My objectives are to review our research to date, and to present a new central theme and conceptual approach for future research. Our research has focused on understanding how dissolved organic matter (DOM) from upstream oligotrophic marshes interacted with a marine source of the limiting nutrient, phosphorus (P), to control productivity in the oligolialine estuarine ecotone. We have been working along freshwater to marine transects in two drainage basins located in Everglades National Park (ENP). The Shark River Slough transect (SRS) has a direct connection to the Gulf of Mexico, providing this estuarine ecotone with a source of marine P. The oligolialine ecotone along our southern Everglades transect (TS/Ph), however, is separated from this marine P source by the Florida Bay estuary. We originally hypothesized an ecosystem productivity peak in the SRS ecotone, driven by the interaction of marine P and Everglades DOM, but no such productivity peak in the TS/Ph ecotone because of this lack of marine P. Our research to date has tended to show the opposite pattern, however, with many ecosystem components showing enhanced productivity in the TS/Ph ecotone, but not in the SRS ecotone. Water column P concentrations followed a similar pattern, with unexpectedly high P in the TS/Ph ecotone during the dry season. Our organic geochemical research has shown that Everglades DOM is more refractory than originally hypothesized. We have also begun to understand the importance of detrital organic matter production and transport to ecotone dynamics and as the base of aquatic food webs. Our future research will build on this substantial body of knowledge about these oligotrophic estuaries. We will direct our efforts more strongly on biophysical dynamics in the oligohaline ecotone regions. Specifically, we will be focusing on inputs to these regions from four primary water sources: freshwater Everglades runoff, net precipitation, marine inputs, and groundwater. We are hypothesizing that dry season groundwater inputs of P will be particularly important to TS/Ph ecotone dynamics because of longer water residence times in this area. Our organic geochemical, biogeochemical, and ecosystem energetics work will focus more strongly on the importance of detrital organics and will take advantage of a key Everglades Restoration project, scheduled for 2008 or 2009, that will increase freshwater inputs to our SRS transect only. Finally, we will also begin to investigate the human dimensions of restoration, and of a growing population in south Florida that will become increasingly dependent on the Everglades for critical ecosystem services (including fresh water) even as its growth presents challenges to Everglades sustainability.

TI User Fee in Public Health Institutions An Experience Across Asian and
   African Countries
SO INDIAN JOURNAL OF SOCIAL WORK
LA English
DT Article
AB The introduction of user fee as an alternative source of health financing is widely being questioned across nations mainly because of its inability to generate the required revenue needed for any significant improvements in the quality of care and its implications on equity. This article looks at the experiences of some Asian and African countries for implementation of the fee, which was basically meant to increase the quality, efficiency, sustainability and effectiveness of the government health services and seeks to draw lessons for a country like India. This has been done by the review of relevant national and international studies in the area.

DE Nanomaterials; Membranes; Oxidation; Adsorbents; Toxicity
AB In the environmental technology industry alone, nanomaterials will enable new means of reducing the production of industrial wastes, using resources more sparingly, remediating industrial contamination, providing potable water, and improving the efficiency of energy production. This paper discusses three new kinds of nanotechnology materials that should be developed in the future: Membranes, oxidants, and adsorbents. Nanoscale control of membrane architecture may yield membranes of greater selectivity and lower cost in both water treatment and water fabrication. Fullerene-based oxidant nanomaterials such as C60 have a high electron affinity and reactivity, and are capable of producing reactive oxygen species such as singlet oxygen and superoxides. Fullerenes might be used in engineered systems to photocatalytically oxidize organic contaminants, or inhibit or inactivate microbes. The ability to tailor surfaces can help to increase adsorbing capacities or recognize specific contaminants. The potential environmental risks are that nanomaterials could interact with biota and that their toxicity adversely may affect ecosystems. As nanochemistry emerges as an important force behind new environmental technologies, we are also presented with the responsibility of considering the environmental implications of an emerging technology at its inception and taking every precaution to ensure that these technologies develop as tools of sustainability rather than becoming future liabilities.

TI Multifactorial and participative methodology for the evaluation of
   agroecological and environmental deterioration of two river basins in
   Trujillo State, Venezuela
SO INTERCIENCIA
LA Spanish
DT Article
AB A participative and multifactorial methodology was applied to evaluate the agroecological and environmental deterioration of the microbasins Rio Blanco and El Socorro, located in the subbasins of the Escuque and La Palma rivers, respectively. Both subriver basins belong, geographically, to the Trujillo State, Venezuela. Field trips were conducted to observe in situ some conditioning characteristics of the increasing deterioration shown by these microbasins. Based on the methodological instruments matrix cause-effect and matrix problem-solution, the level of deterioration of these microbasins was determined. The global analysis of the environmental deterioration was conducted for both areas, applying parametric relations defined by the authors in previous studies. It was determined that the Rio Blanco microbasin exhibits a deterioration value (VD) of 678, and that in El Socorro, microbasin VD=572. According to this methodology it can be concluded that the most relevant causes of deterioration are the absence of a territorial ordaining plan and the lack of technical management by government entities. It is recommended to define an environmental and agricultural operational plan able to identify priorities and design viable, feasible and sustainable productive projects in the agricultural, forestry and agroforestry sectors for these microbasins.

DE health economics; municipalities; partnership; incentives; games
AB This article studies strategic behavior in municipal health care consortia where neighboring municipalities form a partnership to supply high-complexity health care. Each municipality partially funds the organization. Depending on the partnership contract, a free rider problem may jeopardize the organization. A municipality will default its payments if:it can still benefit from the services, especially when political pressures for competing expenditure arise. The main result is that the partnership sustainability depends on punishment mechanisms to a defaulting member, the gains from joint provision of services and the overall economic environment. Possible solutions to the incentive problem are discussed. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Objective On the basis of a case study in Pakistan, the paper argues that good governance, characterized by transparency, accountability and meaningful community participation, plays a critical role in the sustainability of donor-funded health systems projects in the public health sector.
   Methods The Family Health Project (FHP) (1992-1999), funded by the World Bank, has been used as a case study. Critical analysis of secondary data mainly obtained from the Department of Health (DoH) in the province of Sindh in Pakistan is the major tool used for the study. Data from other sources including the World Bank have also been used.
   Results The analysis reveals that the existing health care system could not fully absorb and sustain major "sociopolitical" thrusts of the project, meaningful community participation and "democratic" decision-making processes being the most important ones. The hierarchical structure and management process made it difficult to produce a sense of ownership of the project among all managers and the rank and file staff. The Provincial Health Development Center (PHDC) and District Health Development Centers (DHDCs) established by the FHP did not receive adequate financial and political support from DoH and the Ministry of Health to have much control of the project at the local level. Consequently, these Centers largely failed to institutionalize a continuing training program for district level health officials/professionals. Due to lack of political support, the District Health Management Teams (DHMTs) could not be institutionalized. Community participation in the DHMTs was symbolic rather than forceful. Improved coordination among all stakeholders, more stable and competent leadership, more meaningful community participation, greater devolution of project management to the district level, and better management of resources would have resulted in more effective and efficient implementation of the project. Based on these findings, the paper introduces a sustainable Management Approach (SMA) as a tool that can be used to ensure the sustainability of health systems projects, particularly those funded by international organizations in developing countries.
   Conclusions Good governance and a conducive organizational culture are important prerequisites for incorporating any new project within an existing system. This includes prior consensus building among all stakeholders, a meaningful and inclusive participatory planning, implementation and evaluation process involving communities, political commitment, and the identification and use of appropriate leadership for project management.

ID CYCLE IMPACT ASSESSMENT; FRAMEWORK
AB Goal, Scope and Background. Societal assessment is advocated as one of the three pillars in the evaluation of, and movement toward, sustainability. As is the case with the well established LCA, and the emerging LCC, societal life cycle assessment should be developed in such as way as to permit relative product comparisons, rather than absolute analyses. The development of societal life cycle assessment is in its infancy, and important concepts require clarification including the handling of the more than two hundred social indicators. Therefore, any societal life cycle assessment methodology must explain why it is midpoint- or endpoint-based as well as its reasons to be complimentary with, or included within, life cycle assessment.
   Methods. A geographically specific midpoint based societal life cycle assessment methodology, which employs labour hours as an intermediate variable in the calculation has been developed and evaluated against an existing LCA comparing two detergents. The methodology is based on using an existing life cycle inventory and, therefore, has identical system boundaries and functional units to LCA. The societal life cycle assessment methodology, much like LCA, passes from inventory, through characterisation factors, to provide an ultimate result. In analogy to economics and cost estimation, societal life cycle assessment combines, into its statistics, both data as well as estimates, some of which are correlated to elements of the LCI. It focuses on the work hours required to meet basic needs.
   Results. The societal life cycle assessment of an appended case study indicates that Detergent 2 generates, relative Detergent 1, approximately 20% less employment in Russia, 35% less in France, and approximately five times more in Canada and South Africa, the latter derived from its higher aluminium content. There is essentially no difference in the employment in the use country (Switzerland) nor in Morocco, where some of the waste disposal was assumed to take place.
   Discussion. Given that housing is more affordable, in terms of shelter units per labour hour, in South Africa, compared to Europe, it is, therefore, of no surprise that Detergent 2 provides a societal benefit in terms of housing. Detergent 2 does, however, result in dematerialization, in that its environmental impact is lower (LCI). Therefore, as less resources are employed and labour required, in extraction, production and transport, the societal benefits in health care, education and necessities, a grouped variable, are lower for Detergent 2. This is despite the employment shift away from Europe and to less 'developed' regions.
   Conclusions. The assessment of societal impacts involves several hundred specific indicators. Therefore, aggregation is, if not impossible, at least heavily value laden and, therefore, not recommended. The impact of a societal action, derived from a product purchase or otherwise, is also highly local. Given this, societal life cycle assessment, carried through to the midpoints, and based on an existing LCI, has been developed as a methodology. The results, for an existing LCA-detergent case, illustrate that societal life cycle assessment provides a means to investigate how policy and policy makers can be linked to sustainable development. The sensitivity analyses also clarify the decisions in regards to product improvement.
   Recommendations and Perspectives. The goal of societal life cycle assessment is not to make decisions, but rather to point out tradeoffs to decision- or policy-makers. This case, and the methodology that it is based on, permit such a comparison. Substituting Detergent 2 for Detergent 1 reduces resource use at the expense of an increase in atmospheric and terrestrial emissions. Access to housing is improved, though at the expense of education, health care and necessities. As a recommendation, one would look at the fact that the majority of indicators are superior for Detergent 2 relative to Detergent land seek to improve the aqueous emissions in Detergent 2 via a change in the formulation. An energy or fossil fuel substitution at the site of production could also improve the societal benefits in terms of education and health care.
   While societal life cycle assessment remains in its infancy, a methodology does exist. The field can, therefore, be viewed in a similar way to LCA in the early 1990s, with a need to validate, consolidate and, ultimately, built toward a standard. The contribution is aimed at contributing to such a discussion and therefore proposes that a societal life cycle assessment be LCI-derived, geographically specific, based on mid-points, and use employment as an intermediate variable.

ID LIFE-CYCLE OPTIMIZATION
AB Goal, Scope and Background. In Japan, the abatement of CO, emission by households is a significant problem. Hence, it is necessary to formulate a long-term policy on the use of long-life and highly-insulating technologies for houses; these technologies are expected to reduce CO, emission. The conventional LCA methodology can evaluate the environmental impact of these technologies, while not necessarily providing sufficient information to support policy-making because of its analytical perspective. The aim of the present study is to first develop a new methodology to examine the optimal use of technologies to formulate an environmental policy by considering dynamic socioeconomic conditions. Second, as a demonstration, such a developed methodology is applied to explore an environmentally conscious housing policy for CO, abatement in Japan.
   Methods. A new methodology was developed, considering the context of a society where technologies are introduced, in order to determine the optimal configuration of technologies to minimize the cumulative environmental burden over time on a social scale. An inter-temporal linear programming model using an input-output table was formulated to make the methodology operational. Using the new model, the optimal use of long-life and thermal-insulating technologies for houses is examined to minimize CO, emissions across the entire life cycle of all the houses in Japan.
   Results and Discussion. The results of the model simulation indicate that not only long-life and highly-insulating technologies, but also short-life and poorly-insulating technologies, are required to minimize CO, emissions over a long period. According to the conventional LCA, a house with a short life is inferior to that with a long life, and a house with poor insulation is inferior to that with high insulation. However, houses with a short life and/or poor insulation are introduced in a transition phase to a certain extent before the final stage is reached that is completely dominated by highly-insulated houses with a long life. In other words, the existing houses that were built in the past are gradually replaced with highly-insulated houses with a long life after first building houses with a short life and/or poor insulation. It is not always feasible or not necessarily an optimal solution on a social scale to introduce only a technology that is best evaluated by using the conventional LCA. Inferior technologies can also play a significant role because of various socio-economic conditions and requirements, e.g. population decline, limited housing budgets, and employment stability. Dynamic socio-economic conditions significantly influence the optimal mix of technologies for CO, minimization in the entire society.
   Conclusions and Recommendations. The present study suggests that it is critical to consider dynamic socio-economic conditions when examining technologies for selection with the aim of a long-term reduction of the environmental burden. The new methodology proposed can provide valuable information to support policy-making toward a sustainable society.

   practitioners; Uganda
ID DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; CARE; MANAGEMENT; KNOWLEDGE
AB Background: Access to reliable information is the most cost-effective and achievable strategy for sustainable improvement in health care. While several studies have described practitioners' information seeking behavior in developed countries, literature from developing countries is lacking. The aims of the study were: (i) to determine the most influential type of information for health workers' and planners' decision making; (ii) to establish the practitioners' evaluation of the availability and quality of this important information; and (iii) to establish the most commonly used/accessible sources of the information relevant for decision making in Uganda.
   Methods: Self-administered questionnaires were sent to 610 health workers, planners, and administrators at the national, district and health facility levels in four districts in Uganda. Respondents were reminded three times, after which non-response was registered. Data were entered, cleaned and analysed using SPSS version 12.0. Logistic regression analysis was used to test for differences in responses.
   Results: The response rate was 67.7% (413). The respondents indicated that personal experience (79%), discussion with colleagues (76%) and national policy and treatment guidelines (75%) were most influential when making decisions in health care and planning. They reported that most of the epidemiological information was available and of relatively good quality but there was lack of information about distribution of benefit, segregated demographic data, and social values. The most often used sources of information included; discussions with colleagues (89%), doctors' statements (85%) and textbooks (77%). The least frequently used sources were the internet and the library. This varied with respondents' designation and region of origin.
   Conclusions: Health planners and practitioners lack some of the information relevant for decision making. They tend to rely on the national policy and treatment guidelines, discussion with colleagues, and personal experience. Most frequently used sources of information are similar to previous studies. The variation in the frequency of use of the different sources of research information necessitates research to understand the barriers and careful planning of health information delivery to ensure equitable access.

AB Purpose: To present the lessons learned from an evaluation of a comprehensive telehealth project regarding success factors and evaluation methodology for such projects.
   Methods: A recent experience with the evaluation of new telehealth services in BC, Canada, is summarized. Two domains of clinical applications, as well as educational and administrative uses, and the project environment were evaluated. In order to contribute to the success of the project, the evaluation included formative and summative approaches employing qualitative and quantitative methods with data collection from telehealth events, participants and existing databases. The evaluation had to be carried out under severe budgetary and time constraints. We therefore deliberately chose a broad ranging exploratory approach within a framework provided, and generated questions to be answered on the basis of initial observations and participant driven interviews with progressively more focused and detailed data gathering, including perusal of a variety of existing data sources. A unique feature was an economic evaluation using static simulation models.
   Results: The evaluation yielded rich and detailed data, which were able to explain a number of unanticipated findings.
   One clinical application domain was cancelled after 6 months, the other continues. The factors contributing to success include:
   Focus on chronic conditions which require visual information for proper management.
   Involvement of established teams in regular scheduled visits or in sessions scheduled well in advance.
   Problems arose with:
   Ad hoc applications, in particular under emergency conditions.
   Applications that disregard established referral patterns.
   Applications that support only part of a unit's services.
   The latter leads to the service mismatch dilemma (SMMD) with the end result that even those e-health services provided are not used.
   The problems encountered were compounded by issues arising from the manner in which the telehealth services had been introduced, in particular the lack of time for preparation and establishment of routine use.
   Educational applications had significant clinical benefits. Administrative applications generated savings which exceeded the substantial capital investment and made educational and clinical applications available at variable cost.
   Conclusion: Evaluation under severe constraints can yield rich information. The identified success factors, including provision of an overarching architecture and infrastructure, strong program management, thorough needs analysis and detailing applications to match the identified needs should improve the sustainability of e-health projects. Insights gained:
   Existing assumptions before the study was conducted:
   Evaluation has to proceed from identified questions according to a rigorous experimental design.
   Emergency and trauma services in remote regions can and should be supported via tele-health based on video-conferencing.
   Educational applications of telehealth directed at providers are beneficial for recruitment and retention of providers in remote areas.
   Insights gained by the study:
   An exploratory approach to evaluation using a multiplicity of methods can yield rich and detailed information even under severe constraints.
   Ad hoc and emergency clinical applications of telehealth can present problems unless they are based on thorough, detailed analyses of environment and need, conform to established practice patterns and rely on established trusting collaborative relationships.
   Less difficult applications should be introduced before attempting to support use under emergency conditions.
   Educational applications are of interest beyond the provider community to patients, family and community members, and have clinical value.
   In large, sparsely populated areas with difficult travel conditions administrative applications by themselves generate savings that compensate for the substantial capital investment for telehealth required for clinical applications. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study examines the possibility of designating and implementing a citywide public space network, constituted of randomly dispersed and not interrelated public spaces and greenways across the city of Mugla. Although Mugla is a major coastal province, with worldwide tourism districts, the city centre falls behind other settlements in terms of quality of social life, physical layout, economic investment and tourism revenue. In 2001, the local government commissioned the Department of Landscape Architecture of Ege University to prepare a comprehensive master plan towards achieving a corporate public space network, as well as development strategies to ameliorate the previous failures. The master plan developed a blueprint for the city-wide network and addressed each existing or potential public space and greenway as integrated components of the network. The process involved short-, medium- and long-term action from the local government to achieve the physical layout and efficiently implement phases of the network. As a guide for other small or medium urban settlements in Turkey, a model proposal was derived from the study to address formulation, implementation, and management of the network in order to create a sustainable urban development.

DE eco-effectiveness; state of bliss (ideal state); energy intensity;
   material intensity; sustainability
AB Eco-efficiency has been pursued over the last two decades in different industries and branches. But, despite the fact that the culture and economic advantage in this direction have improved considerably, this paradigm must be considered a limitation if related to the necessity of greatly increasing resource productivity (at least by ten times), within sustainability. As a consequence of this, the new paradigm of co-effectiveness must be introduced and spread within all economies, in order to modify the type of development. This concept is outlined and discussed here, by taking as reference the 'ideal state', consisting of the use of zero resources (energy, materials, water, etc.) in all economic systems. Since this target cannot be achieved, it maybe defined as 'state of bliss' and, in each different situation (branch of industry, services, whole economy), it is only possible to measure the 'distance' between a real situation and the 'ideal state', through a specific formula that is here reported. The distance can be obtained by using the energy and the material intensity at micro and macro levels. This formula permits both the obtaining of absolute figures and the comparison of different situations in the same branch of industry at different times and/or in different countries, and between different countries as a whole.

ID DESERTIFICATION
AB Land degradation threatens environmental well-being and is a growing global issue. China is among the most affected countries in the world in terms of the extent, intensity and economic impact of land degradation. Sustainable and successful intervention requires clear definition and quantification of land degradation. Based on land resource variation survey data from 1991 to 2002, this paper identified, defined and classified land resource degradation, and analyzed dynamic changes in the degradation and rehabilitation process. Through the establishment of a land resource degradation index, the status and trend of degradation in China was explored to enable the design and planning of interventions for mitigation and establishment of sustainable land use and management practices. Results showed that: (1) The total land degradation index (A) fluctuated upwards from 1991 to 2002, although some parts improved. (2) Sand and rock desertification, deforestation and wetland loss reduced slightly, whereas secondary salinification, non-agricultural land occupation and natural grassland further deteriorated. (3) 66.27% of degradation was in natural grassland and non-agricultural land; while 57.5% of rehabilitation focused on sandy desertification and forests. (4) Non-agricultural land occupation and wetland shrinkage are primary causes of land resource deterioration in China. (5) Grassland, cultivated land and forest land accounted for 83.9% of degradation. (6) All the degradation processes are interrelated. These results provide useful information to combat future land resource degradation in China.

ID PHRAGMITES-AUSTRALIS
AB The harvesting of Phragmites australis reeds in the Tembe Elephant Park has to be managed pro-actively. Solutions to potential problems should be sought before they arise. This paper offers a potential solution to the problem of instating a winter-only reed harvest in the Muzi Swamp. The potential for manufacturing finished products such as prefabricated huts from sustainably harvested reeds and forest timber is examined and a cost estimate is presented. A prefabricated reed hut is three-times cheaper than a similarly sized house made of bricks and cement. The manufacturing of finished products from the harvested material will add secondary value to the resource and also offer an alternative employment to harvesting reeds in the summer. The higher prices obtained for a processed article will also, hopefully, reduce the demand for the resource in its raw form, thereby increasing the perceived value of the resource and reducing wastage from raw materials that are not sold.

TI The benchmarking of a beet sugar plant - how to rate the environmental
   performance of a sugar plant against the sectors best
SO INTERNATIONAL SUGAR JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB Despite many existing frameworks for the assessment of companies' sustainability, none of them specifically includes the benchmarking of beet sugar plants. This paper focuses on the performance assessment of traditional beet sugar plants, by considering the Best Available Techniques for beet sugar production, as determined by the Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control Directive. The main objective was to establish a model for the self-evaluation of environmental and technological performances by sugar plants, benchmarked by the achievements expressed in the Reference Documents on Best Available Techniques for sugar production. The effectiveness of the model was tested in the performance assessment of the case-studied sugar plant producing beet sugar and other sugar related products. Based on the results of this case study, the model was recognized as a promising one for comparing the environmental and technological performances of the sugar plant with the leading sustainability-driven sugar plants.

DT Article
DE cultural energy analysis; broiler; performance; housing capacity
ID DIFFERENT STOCKING DENSITIES; PERFORMANCE; SUSTAINABILITY
AB Data obtained from 4 different capacity houses were evaluated to analyse the cultural energy and performance of broilers. Capacities of housings were 20,000, 25,000, 30,000 and 60,000 birds per production period and they were assigned as HI, HII, HIII and HIV, respectively. The study was conducted in 2005 in which there were 6 production periods of 45 days. Data collected for each period were: date of starting and finishing; number of chicks entered and broilers sold; live weight at slaughter; carcass weight; feed consumption for starting, growing and finishing phase; labour; medication, vaccination and disinfectant; electricity consumption; heating and cooling methods and amount spent; distance for transportation of feed, chicks, broilers, wood shaving, limestone; and other miscellaneous expenditures. Ross 308 chickens in all houses received the same commercial feed and water ad libitum. Chicks were reared under a conventional temperature regimen. Chicks were fed starter, grower and finisher diets according to their ages. Even though capacities for houses were different their stocking densities were 16.36, 16.00, 16.38 and 16.54 birds/m(2) for HI, HII, HIII and HIV, respectively. For cultural energy analysis, feed, transportation, labour, machinery, electricity, brooding, and other inputs were calculated and corresponding energy values for each input were obtained from literature. For the analysis it was assumed that carcasses would have 18.2% protein and 15.2% fat. Total cultural energy invested in broilers in HIII was lower than that of broilers in HI (P < 0.05). Energy input per kg live weight gain and per kg carcass of HIII were lower than that of HI (P < 0.05, P < 0.01, respectively). The HIII had lower cultural energy ratio for protein energy output than HI (0.01). Energy efficiency (kcal input/kcal output) of HIII was better than that of HI (P < 0.01). Results of the study showed that increasing capacity of housings decreases cultural energy input up to certain capacity and indicated that increasing housing capacity without interfering with performance could be a means for energy conservation in sustainable agriculture.

DT Article
DE Earth-Moon transport system; cable space transport system
ID LUNAR; TEMPERATURE
AB The prospect for non-rocket space transportation system creates an opportunity for new macro-engineering initiatives related to lunar economic development and Earth's ecological sustainability. We propose a macroproject that will transfer collected seawater from the Arctic Ocean and compressed carbon dioxide gas from the planet's atmosphere via a conveyer belt-like space transport system to the Moon. Creation of a subterranean cave or surface dome-enclosed lunar seawater reservoir (lake, ocean) will permit remarkable industrial transformations of the Moon's crust; carbon dioxide is a useful industrial gas, perhaps worthy of bulk transport to the Moon. Abstraction of carbon dioxide gas and seawater, and its conveyance via a Cable Space Transportation System cable cabins, will result in a slight geo-engineering of Earth.

AB Purpose: To investigate the effect of a six-month teacher-led osteogenic physical activity program, vs. a self-led activity program, on ultrasound measurements of bone in inactive teenage girls.
   Methods: Ninety sedentary girls [mean (SD) age 16.3 (.6) years] were identified from 300 assessed for physical activity across five schools in southeast Ireland. Schools were matched and randomly assigned to a teacher-led physical activity (TLPA) program, a self-led physical activity (SLPA) program, or a control group. Broadband ultrasound attenuation (BUA), speed of sound (SOS), and os calcis stiffness index (OCSI) were measured using a portable ultrasound machine. Anthropornetry, aerobic fitness, calcium intake, and physical activity were assessed, and focus groups held one month after program completion. Descriptive statistics, paired t-tests, and analysis of variance were used to analyze the data.
   Results: Both intervention groups demonstrated significant improvements (p <.05) in BUA, SOS, OCSI and aerobic fitness, i.e., TLPA: + 14.9%, + 21.9%, + 15.9%, and + 8.5 %, respectively, and SLPA: + 10.6%, + 30.3 %, + 15.6%, and + 5.1 %, respectively, with no change in controls. Differences between intervention groups and controls were significant for BUA and OCSI (p < .05). TLPA and SLPA groups engaged in an average of 4.5 and 3.4 hours/week of physical activity, respectively, over the intervention period. The SLPA group continued to exercise after the intervention had ceased, whereas the TLPA group did not.
   Conclusions: Previously inactive teenage girls can adhere to an osteogenic activity program whether supervised or directing their own activity. Longer-term, sustainable initiatives with this age group are needed and might focus on developing personal skills for physical activity. 0 2006 Society for Adolescent Medicine. All rights reserved.

AB Americans' excessive consumption of food harms their health and quality of life and also causes direct and indirect environmental degradation, through habitat loss and increased pollution from agricultural fertilizers and pesticides. We show here that reducing food consumption (and eating less meat) could improve Americans' health and well-being while facilitating environmental benefits ranging from establishing new national parks and protected areas to allowing more earth-friendly farming and ranching techniques. We conclude by considering various public policy initiatives to lower per capita caloric intake and excessive meat consumption, and to translate this temperate behavior into substantial environmental protection.

AB A simulation study using the Seasonal Analysis program of the Decision Support Systems for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT 3.5) suite of models was conducted from 2001 to 2003 under a subhumid subtropical climate. The models CERES-Rice and CERES-Wheat in DSSAT 3.5 were calibrated and validated for transplanted rice, direct seeded rice and wheat crops using the soil and weather parameters of Kharagpur, West Bengal, India. The weather generator program, SIMMETEO, was used to generate future weather scenarios based on weather data from 9 consecutive years. These weather scenarios were used in the seasonal analysis program to run each treatment combination with 20 replications. The results of both biophysical and economic analyses of the Seasonal Analysis program predicted an application of 120 kg N/ha along with both rice and wheat crop residues at 4 t/ha for rice, whereas the economical analysis, specifically the Mean-Gini analysis, showed that application of 80 kg N/ha along with both rice and wheat crop residue incorporation at 4 t/ha as the most dominant management options for wheat. The present study revealed that the generated future weather data were reliable and DSSAT could successfully use it to predict the future crop yields under different management practices and select the best one for sustainable production of rice and wheat crops by DSSAT.

TI Output and sustainability of organic ley/arable crop rotations at two

SO JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
ID FARMING SYSTEMS; SOIL FERTILITY; MANAGEMENT
AB Trials at Tulloch, Aberdeen (sandy loam soil, 820 mm rainfall) and Woodside, Elgin (light sandy loam, 730 mm) compared organically managed crop rotations containing different proportions of spring oats, swedes, potatoes and grass/clover leys (0-50 and 0-67 of the rotation at Tulloch; 0-38 and 0-50 at Woodside). The trials simulated farm conditions through the use of grazing animals and the recycling of farmyard manure. The rotations at each site gave similar financial outputs. Yields of oats were higher where these were grown after the main ley phase of the rotation than where they were grown later in the rotation (more ears/m' and grains/ear), but were not significantly higher after a 4-year ley than after a 3-year ley at Tulloch. It was concluded that all of the rotations were agronomically and financially sustainable. Cereal yields showed large year-to-year variations but little indication of a progressive decline. There were only small changes in soil organic matter, soil P and soil K. Increased early summer weed cover in the arable crops was not matched by increases in weed invasion in the grass/clover leys and did not appear to be affecting yields.

AB Optimal sperm cryopreservation is a prerequisite for the sustainable commercial application of frozen-thawed boar semen for AI. Three experiments were performed to identify factors influencing variability of postthaw sperm survival among 464 boar ejaculates. Sperm-rich ejaculate fractions were cryopreserved using a standard freezing-thawing procedure for 0.5-mL plastic straws and computer-controlled freezing equipment. Postthaw sperm motility (assessed with a computer-assisted semen analysis system) and viability (simultaneously probed by flow cytometry analysis after triple-fluorescent stain), evaluated 30 and 150 min postthaw, were used to estimate the success of cryopreservation. In the first experiment, 168 unselected ejaculates (1 ejaculate/boar), from boars of 6 breeds with a wide age range (8 to 48 mo), were cryopreserved over a 12-mo period to evaluate the predictive value of boar (breed and age), semen collection, transport variables (season of ejaculate collection, interval between collections, and ejaculate temperature exposure), initial semen traits, and sperm quality before freezing on sperm survival after freezing-thawing. In Exp. 2, 4 ejaculates from each of 29 boars, preselected according to their initial semen traits and sperm quality before freezing, were collected and frozen over a 6-mo period to evaluate the influence of interboar and intraboar ejaculate variability in the survival of sperm after cryopreservation. In Exp. 3, 12 ejaculates preselected as for Exp. 2, from each of 15 boars with known good sperm cryosurvival, were collected and frozen over a 12-mo period to estimate the sustainability of sperm cryosurvival. between ejaculates over time. Boar and semen collection and transport variables were not predictive of sperm cryosurvival among ejaculates. Initial semen traits and sperm quality variables observed before freezing explained 23.2 and 10.9%, respectively, of the variation in postthaw sperm motility and viability. However, more that 70% of total variance observed in postthaw sperm quality variables among ejaculates was explained by boar. This indicates that boar is the most important (P < 0.001) factor explaining the variability among ejaculates in sperm cryosurvival, with most (14 of the 15 boars in Exp. 3) showing consistent (P > 0.05) sperm cryosurvival over time.

TI Hydrological disturbance benefits a native fish at the expense of an

AB 1. Some native fish in New Zealand do not coexist with introduced salmonids. Previous studies of disjunct distributions of exotic brown trout Salmo trutta and native galaxiids demonstrated native extirpation except where major waterfalls prevented upstream migration of trout. In the Manuherikia River system, we predicted that water abstraction might be a further factor controlling the spatial distribution of both the invader and a native fish.
   2. We applied multiple discriminant function analyses to test for differences in environmental conditions (catchment and instream scales) at sites with roundhead galaxias Galaxias anomalus and brown trout in sympatry and allopatry. We then used a supervised artificial neural network (ANN) to predict the presence-absence of G. anomalus and brown trout (135 sites). The quantification of contributions of environmental variables to ANN models allowed us to identify factors controlling their spatial distribution.
   3.Brown trout can reach most locations in the Manuherikia catchment, and often occur upstream of G. anomalus. Their largely disjunct distributions in this river are mediated by water abstraction for irrigation, together with pool habitat availability and valley slope. Trout are more susceptible than the native fish to stresses associated with low flows, and seem to be prevented from eliminating galaxiid populations from sites in low gradient streams where there is a high level of water abstraction.
   4. Synthesis and applications. In contrast to many reports in the literature, our results show that hydrological disturbance associated with human activities benefits a native fish at the expense of an exotic in the Manuherikia River, New Zealand. Water abstraction is also known to have negative impacts on native galaxiids, therefore we recommend restoring natural low flows to maintain sustainable habitats for native galaxiids, implementing artificial barriers in selected tributaries to limit trout predation on native fish, and removing trout upstream.

ID SIZE-SELECTIVITY; BIOLOGY; SEA
AB Samples of Boops boops ranging from 7.4 to 30.5 cm were obtained mainly by longline, supplemented by beach seining in the Ria Formosa lagoon, and by market sampling in the Algarve (southern Portugal). The macroscopic analyses of the gonads and the gonad somatic index showed that the south coast of Portugal B. boops spawn mainly from late winter to spring, between February and May. The length at first maturity was similar for males and females and the value for both sexes combined was estimated to be 15.22 cm, corresponding to an age range of 1-3. Age was determined by reading growth bands on otoliths. Age determination was validated by marginal increment analysis. The estimated parameters were L-infinity = 28.06, K = 0.22 and t(0) = -1.42. Mortality rates were calculated for fish captured with longlines, and the estimated parameters were M = 0.33, Z = 1.04 and F = 0.71. Relative yield per recruit analysis and sensitivity analysis showed that the resource is moderately exploited. From the perspective of sustainability, these results provide support for the use of longlines as a gear that is among the least harmful for species such as the bogue.

AB The Gulf of California, considered one of the most pristine areas of the world, hosts more than 50 seaweed species that have commercial applications. Only one species, however, is presently harvested commercially. In order to establish potential areas for seaweed use, a Geographical Information System (GIS) was used to determine areas for potential seaweed exploitation based on more than 9000 literature records. The system allows for the determination of sites, areas and times of the year when commercial species may be available. This information is being considered in a zoning program that would determine the areas of the Gulf sustainable for use or conservation. Temperature data were also included in order to determine potential areas for seaweed cultivation. GIS proves to be a powerful tool for large-scale management of seaweed resources.

AB The temporary wetlands of Eastern Mauritania in the Sahel region of Africa, are productive systems in an and environment. Traditionally managed wetlands provide habitats for a wide range of plant and animal species and support local livelihoods through multiple land use. The heterogeneity and socio-economic importance of the wetlands is reflected in a cultural nomenclature, but the land use, environmental and biological basis of the nomenclature has not been studied. In this paper, the cultural typology is described from a structured field survey of site biophysical and land use attributes recorded in a regional site inventory.
   A numerical classification of inventory sites based on the plant species used for food and materials (resource species), showed that it was significantly associated with the cultural typology. Ordination of the sites showed that key underlying environment gradients significantly influencing resource species composition were water availability and land use intensity. Each cultural type occupied a unique location in ordination space corresponding to its hydrology and land use. A site ordination based on animal wildlife species composition showed that the duration of standing water was a key significant explanatory variable, with land use intensity of secondary importance.
   Analysis supports the view that traditional land use is based on understanding environment, plant growth and wildlife interactions and that this is the basis of sustainable management. Recent schemes to develop single-use agricultural systems by changing wetland shape and hydrology do not take cultural typology or traditional use systems into account. We propose that decisions on land use change at site and regional landscape scales would benefit from considering traditional management practices and that the cultural typology can be used as an indicator of site development potential.

AB We tested the effectiveness of prepayment for advice and aligned incentives as mechanisms for enhancing trust in unfamiliar advisers in decision-making under uncertainty. Participants were low-income Zimbabweans who played two rounds of the Monty Hall three-door game. In round 1, participants who purchased advice were significantly more likely to follow advice for how to win the game than were participants who received free advice. In round 2, the apparent effectiveness of advisers' suggestions in round 1 moderated participants' propensity to follow advice. If the round I advice appeared wrong, the credibility enhancing benefits of prepayment diminished. If the advice appeared right, the benefits of prepayment maintained. Hypotheses with regard to the benefits of aligned incentives received only weak support. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Efficiency and effectiveness are central terms in assessing business performance, yet the challenge for companies is to balance efficiency with effectiveness in business networks. Companies often fail to achieve differentiation and innovation in their surrounding networks, through dealing with efficiency and neglecting effectiveness. This article describes the term efficiency as a necessary condition or hurdle reflected in the company's operating margins, and 'effectiveness' as the company's ability to generate a sustainable growth of earnings in its surrounding network. The study builds on notions of efficiency and effectiveness using empirical research in manufacturer-retailer networks conducted between 2002 and 2005. The study draws conclusions to the importance of linking efficiency and effectiveness and more widely on companies' performance in business networks. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Lean processes for sustainable project delivery

ID TOYOTA
AB Facility owners and project teams often struggle to engage "green" or "sustainable" requirements on building projects and can incur additional project costs as a result. Although "investments" in high performance building features can be paid back through operational savings, the project delivery methods currently adopted by most teams are laden with process waste. Lean production principles have been proven to reduce waste and improve process performance in highly complex development and production environments. Adopting these lean principles, this paper reports a study that identified the presence of value and waste in a sustainable building project. Through an empirical investigation of the Real Estate and Facilities Division of Toyota Motor Sales, Toyota's capital facility delivery process was mapped to identify both the steps in project delivery critical for success (value) and those that are waste. The investigation focused on the South Campus Facility, which received U.S. Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design Gold certification at a project cost equivalent to a conventional facility. Through post hoc process-based analysis, insight about what added value and waste in sustainable project delivery at Toyota was obtained. The results also identify further improvement opportunities to Toyota's delivery process. For corporate facility owners and the Architecture Engineering Construction industry, the results unearth insights about how to successfully and economically deliver sustainable facilities.

AB To evaluate resistance to Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner (Bt) toxins, adult female bollworms, Helicoverpa zea (Boddie) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), were collected from four light trap locations in two eastern North Carolina counties from August to October during 2001 and 2002. Females were allowed to oviposit, and upon hatching, 24 neonates from each female (F(1) lines) were screened for survival and growth rate on each of three diets: non-Bt diet, diet containing 5.0 mu g/ml Cry1Ac toxin, or diet containing 5.0 mu g/ml Cry2Ab toxin. These screens were designed to identify nonrecessive Bt resistance alleles present in field populations of bollworm. Of 561 and 691 families screened with both Cry1Ac- and Cry2Ab-containing diets in 2001 and 2002, respectively, no F(1) lines were identified that seemed to carry a gene conferring substantial resistance to either Cry1Ac or Cry2Ab. Adults from F(1) lines with growth scores in the highest (R) and lowest (S) quartiles were mated in four combinations, RxR, SxR, RxS, and SxS. Differences in growth rates of larvae from these crosses demonstrated that there is substantial quantitative genetic variation in eastern North Carolina populations for resistance to both Cry1Ac and Cry2Ab toxins. These findings, in addition to results suggesting partially dominant inheritance of resistance to Cry1Ac and Cry2Ab, are critically important for determining appropriate resistance management strategies that impact the sustainability of transgenic cotton, Gossypium hirsutum (L.).

TI The analytic assessment of online portfolios in undergraduate technical
   communication: A model
SO JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
DE technical communication; assessment; portfolios; online
AB This paper describes an innovative model for assessing the technical communication course by analytically scoring online portfolios, open to the internet, for ten separate (analytic) variables and one overall (holistic) score. The model is a statistically verifiable and sustainable method that strengthens the curriculum and fosters consensus within the teaching community. We achieved construct validity by redefining the elements of the course to incorporate communication in the digital age and then by creating new criteria for evaluation related to that construct. We achieved inter-reader reliability by beginning each assessment with a calibrated reading and by adjudicating non-adjacent scores. After using the model successfully for three semesters, we can see increased consistency in teaching among sections and semesters, more communication among instructors, and we are beginning a database with which we can test farther change. The theory and method behind this model can be applied to other disciplines as well.

AB Activities of fishermen in the Bay of La Paz, B. C. S. are focused to satisfy the local demand of fish and shellfish by using approximately 300 small outboard crafts equipped with gillnets. Sea lions in this Bay attack the fishes captured damaging both product and gear. We did experimental gillnet throws to determine the frequency and preferences of sea lions in fishing areas. 52 experimental gillnet throws with time averages of 2 hr were performed, rending an average of 30 kg of fish captured and less than 10% of damages to the net. Traditional fishermen in this Bay usually left the net the whole night, (approximately 750 hr, obtaining an average of 50 kg of captured fish, but the damages to the nets is in average of 40%. The cost-benefit balance comparing our alternative fishing method, which includes the use of the gillnets during the afternoon, watching for sea lions and retiring the nets at their arrival, it is more sustainable and profitable than the traditional fishing method currently used by the local fishermen. This paper suggests how to minimize the harmful effects of the sea lions on the fishermen productivity and gear, maximizing the production and reducing the damage. Our alternative method is applicable to other regions where this harmful interaction is taking place. We conclude that the coexistence of sea lions-fisheries is feasible, by applying the simple measures that we propose.

AB The potential for simultaneous sludge minimization and enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) in Cannibal solids reduction processes was investigated. To simulate a Cannibal-EBPR system, a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) operated with anaerobic and aerobic cycles was coupled with an anaerobic sidestream bioreactor, which received mixed liquor from the SBR and returned the same amount of treated sludge back to the SBR. The biomass yield in the Cannibal-EBPR system was estimated to be 0.16 mg volatile suspended solids (VSS)/mg chemical oxygen demand, which represented a 16-33% reduction in solids production compared to a Control-EBPR system operated with a 10-day solids retention time, for which conventional digestion of excess sludge was assumed. Regarding EBPR, greater than 98% phosphorus removal was sustainable in the Cannibal-EBPR system, but a mass balance on total phosphorus could not be closed, with nearly 33% of the phosphorus unaccounted. The fate of the missing phosphorus could not be resolved.

AB An investigation of dye decolorization from synthetic dye solutions using the non-ionic, water-soluble, high molecular weight seed gums Ipomoea dasysperma and guar gum as coagulants was undertaken. The use of galactomarmans derived from plants in this system presents a sustainable method of textile effluent treatment. These natural coagulants extracted from plants proved to be workable alternatives to conventional coagulants like polyaluminum chloride, as they are biodegradable, safe to human health, are cost effective when compared to imported chemical's and have a wider effective dosage range for flocculation of various colloidal suspensions. Coagulant dose and coagulation pH are important factors influencing the mechanism of coagulation. Also the type and chemical structure of the dye plays an important role in the coagulation process. The seed gums alone were found to be effective for decolorization of direct dye and in combination with PAC their coagulation efficiency was well extended even for reactive and acid dyes.

AB Improvement of primary effluent quality by using an integrated system of emergent plants (Scirpus grossus in the leading subsurface flow arrangement) and submergent plants (Hydrilla verticillata in a subsequent channel) was investigated. The primary effluent was drawn from a septic tank treating domestic sewage from a student dormitory at the University of Peradeniya, Sri Lanka. Influent and effluent samples were collected once every 2 weeks from May 2004 through July 2005 and analyzed to determine water quality parameters. Both the emergent and submergent plants were harvested at predetermined intervals. The results suggested that harvesting prolonged the usefulness of the system and the generation of a renewable biomass with potential economic value. The mean overall pollutant removal efficiencies of the integrated emergent and submergent plant system were biological oxygen demand (BOD(5)), 65.7%; chemical oxygen demand (COD), 40.8%; ammonium (NH(4)(+)-N), 74.8%; nitrate (NO(3)(-)-N), 38.8%; phosphate (PO(4)(3-)), 61.2%; total suspended solids (TSS), 65.8%; and fecal coliforms, 94.8%. The submergent plant subsystem improved removal of nutrients that survived the emergent subsystem operated at low hydraulic retention times. The significant improvement in effluent quality following treatment by the submergent plant system indicates the value of incorporating such plants in wetland systems.

AB This paper describes how compost, a by-product generated by solid waste treatment plants, can be usefully applied to road embankments to prevent erosion. Our study analyzed this process in terms of the following variables: (1) location and orientation; (2) embankment slope; (3) soil and compost characteristics; (4) compost dosage; (5) vegetation species; (6) plot dimensions; and (7) planting method. The results obtained focus on the vegetation survival rate, plant growth and germination; colonization of other species; cover crop for plots; and erosion estimation. It was found that when greater quantities of compost were added to embankments, soil loss was decreased. The addition of this material also produced a marked increase in plant growth, the survival rate of manually planted vegetation, the colonization of other species, as well as the cover crop. However, we observed that compost seemed to hinder the germination of hydroseeded species, whereas colonizing plants germinated more quickly. The side slope was not found to be a significant factor for manually planted species, but turned out to be crucial for hydroseeded varieties.

TI Effect of the irrigation regime, type of fertilization, and culture year
   on the physical properties of almond (cv. Guara)
SO JOURNAL OF FOOD ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
DE CIELAB color space; almond; organic matter; drip irrigation; physical
   properties
AB The physical properties of almond nuts and kernels (cv. Guara) were evaluated as functions of irrigation regime (non-irrigated and irrigated soil), fertilizer treatment (inorganic and organic), and culture cycle (years 2002 and 2003).
   The physical properties were influenced by the irrigation regime: non-irrigation produced nuts of greater mass (M), width (W), and geometric mean diameter (D-p) and kernels of greater mass (M), length (L), and width (W), whilst irrigation gave rise to longer and more spherical nuts and thicker and more spherical kernels. In both water regimes, physical properties of almond nuts did not show significant differences among fertilizer treatments, but almond kernels showed significant differences among fertilizer treatments. Under non-irrigation, longer kernels were obtained in both organic treatments. With irrigation, kernels of lower mass and D-p were obtained in the inorganic treatment (C). The physical properties of almond showed significant differences among culture cycles. These differences were the result of the particular environmental and growth conditions in each year of cultivation. The values of the co-ordinates and attributes of the CIELab color system varied as a function of the climatic conditions in each culture cycle, but not as a function of the irrigation regime or fertilizer treatment.
   The application of irrigation increased the production of almonds in shell (6.16 and 8.88 kg tree(-1) without and with irrigation, respectively) and the percentage of total almond weight as kernel (29.22 and 32.07%, respectively). With organic fertilizers, production was similar to that for inorganic fertilizers: in the absence of irrigation, values were 5.44, 5.68, and 5.77 kg tree(-1) for the inorganic treatment and the organic treatments T1 and T2, respectively, whilst with irrigation the corresponding values were 7.31, 7.44, and 7.00 kg tree(-1). Thus, the organic fertilizers represent a viable alternative to inorganic fertilization and a step towards a sustainable agriculture. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Invasive exotic species pose significant challenges for natural resource managers charged with the maintenance of biological diversity and the sustainable production of forest resources. In this article, we review what is known about the biology and control of some of the most serious woody invaders of eastern forests. Based on the parallels between these invasions, we propose a working framework for integrating invasive control into forestry practices. In general, early detection and rapid response to invasions are essential. However, given that consistently effective control strategies that are broadly applicable simply do not exist for many species, adaptive management strategies will be necessary.

ID CURRENCY CRISES
AB This paper develops a new early warning system (EWS) model, based on a multinomial logit model, for predicting financial crises. It is shown that commonly used EWS approaches, which use binomial discrete-dependent-variable models, are subject to what we call a post-crisis bias. This bias arises when no distinction is made between tranquil periods, when economic fundamentals are largely sound and sustainable, and crisis/post-crisis periods, when economic variables go through an adjustment process before reaching a more sustainable level or growth path. We show that applying a multinomial logit model, which allows distinguishing between more than two states, is a valid way of solving this problem and constitutes a substantial improvement in the ability to forecast financial crises. The empirical results reveal that, for a set of 20 open emerging markets for the period 1993-2001, the model would have correctly predicted a large majority of crises in emerging markets.

AB This paper analyzes dynamic equilibrium risk sharing contracts between profit-maximizing intermediaries and a large pool of ex ante identical agents that face idiosyncratic income uncertainty that makes them heterogeneous ex post. In any given period, after having observed her income, the agent can walk away from the contract, while the intermediary cannot, i.e. there is one-sided commitment. We consider the extreme scenario that the agents face no costs to walking away, and can sign up with any competing intermediary without any reputational losses. We demonstrate that not only autarky, but also partial and full insurance can obtain, depending on the relative patience of agents and financial intermediaries. Insurance can be provided because in an equilibrium contract an up-front payment effectively locks in the agent with an intermediary. We then show that our contract economy is equivalent to a consumption-savings economy with one-period Arrow securities and a short-sale constraint, similar to Bulow and Rogoff [1989. Sovereign debt: is to forgive to forget? American Economic Review 79, 43-50]. From this equivalence and our characterization of dynamic contracts it immediately follows that without cost of switching financial intermediaries debt contracts are not sustainable, even though a risk allocation superior to autarky can be achieved.

AB Nanoparticles are increasingly used in a wide range of applications in science, technology and medicine. Since they are produced for specific purposes which cannot be met by larger particles and bulk material they are likely to be highly reactive, in particular, with biological systems. On the other hand a large body of know-how in environmental sciences is available from toxicological effects of ultrafine particles (smaller than 100 nm in size) after inhalation. Since nanoparticles feature similar reactivity as ultrafine particles a sustainable development of new emerging nanoparticles is required. This paper gives a brief review on the dosimetry of nanoparticles, including deposition in the various regions of the respiratory tract and systemic translocation and uptake in secondary target organs, epidemiologic associations with health effects and toxicology of inhaled nanoparticles. General principles and current paradigms to explain for the specific behaviour of nanoparticles in toxicology are discussed. With that respect we consider nanoparticles to be in the range from 1 to 2 nm (clusters of atoms/molecules) to particles that are smaller than 100 nm at least in one dimension. Since the evidence for health risks of ultrafine and nanoparticles after inhalation has been increasing over the last decade, the paper attempts to extrapolate these findings and principles observed in particle inhalation toxicology into recommendations for an integrated concept of risk assessment of nanoparticles for a broad range of use in science, technology and medicine.

AB It is postulated that dietary carbohydrates and thyroid hormones are major regulators for expression of the lactase/phlorizin hydrolase (LPH) gene in rat jejunum. In this study. we investigated the effects of thyroid hormones and dietary sucrose on LPH gene expression and lactase activity in starved rats. Firstly, animals at 8 wk of age were fed a low-starch diet (5.5% energy as cornstarch) or high-starch diet (71% energy as cornstarch) for 7 d (experiment 1). The mRNA level of LPH as well as lactase activity significantly decreased in rats fed the low-starch diet as compared to those fed the high-starch diet. To investigate the effects of thyroid hormone status, the animals previously fed the low-starch diet were starved for 3 d. and half of the animals were given intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of 20 mu g/100 g body weight triiodothyronine (T-3) twice daily (experiment 2). The LPH mRNA level and lactase activity were elevated by starvation for 3 d, but they were repressed by the injection of T-3 during starvation. To investigate the effects of dietary sucrose in starved rats, they were force-fed a sucrose diet for 6 h (experiment 3). The LPH gene expression and lactase activity were up-regulated by force-feeding a sucrose diet, only when the animals were kept in euthyroid status by daily T-3 administrations. In contrast, the sucrase-isomaltase mRNA levels and sucrase activity were unaffected by force-feeding the sucrose diet for both T-3-treated and untreated starved rats. Our work suggests that dietary sucrose is capable of enhancing lactase gene expression in starved rats when they have a sustainable thyroid hormone level.

AB Objective: Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) has the potential to place an enormous burden on families in resource-poor countries, and the aim of this survey was. to provide more specific insights into the difficulties faced by families living with CAH in Vietnam. It is hoped that this information will be used to ensure that future efforts to reduce the burden of CAH are as effective, sustainable and appropriate as possible.
   Design and Methods: A questionnaire-based needs assessment survey was offered to parents of children with CAH who were attending the Annual CAH Support Group Meeting held at the National Hospital of Pediatrics (NHP) in Hanoi, Vietnam, on 10(th) June 2005.
   Results: Fifty-three families responded to the questionnaire. Information pertaining to the purchase and use of medication to treat CAH, access to medical care, surgical treatment for girls, and a wide range of parental concerns was collected.
   Conclusions: This survey highlights the heavy burden that CAH places on families in Vietnam, and provides significant insights into various initiatives that could well help ease this suffering. In particular, efforts must be made to ensure essential medication is affordably available, communication of important messages to parents is enhanced, local support groups encouraged, and early diagnosis and medical treatment of CAH optimized so as to reduce morbidity and mortality.

AB The 6th edition of the Recommended Standards for Newborn Intensive Care Unit (NICU) Design includes, for the first time, concerns related to sustainability. Environmental responsibility in healthcare had its beginnings in the late-1980s with an awareness of the toxic qualities of mercury and the need to remove it from hospital environments. Since that time, environmental activism in healthcare has grown to include efforts to construct 'green' buildings, incorporate sustainable practice and apply environmentally responsible purchasing. Language inserted into Standards 8 and 18 - 21 is intended to extend sustainable design and practice not only in the design of space in the NICU but also in the selection of materials such as floor surfaces, wall coverings, furnishings and ceiling finishes. This paper includes a number of resources that will not only assist with application of the standards, but also with expanding knowledge of issues related to the development of healthcare settings that are not harmful to either human or environmental health.

ID MIGRATION
AB Economic theory points out that immigration of even low-skilled immigrants may improve public finances in Western welfare states, and it is sometimes suggested that fiscal sustainability problems in Western countries caused by ageing populations could be solved by increasing immigration. We examine consequences of various immigration scenarios using the large-scale computable general equilibrium model Danish rational economic agents model describing the Danish economy. It turns out that increased immigration will generally worsen the Danish fiscal sustainability problem. Improved economic integration of immigrants and their descendants, however, may alleviate the problems of the public sector considerably.

TI The effective mediator
SO JOURNAL OF PROFESSIONAL ISSUES IN ENGINEERING EDUCATION AND PRACTICE
LA English
DT Article
ID TERM SUCCESS; CONFLICT; TACTICS
AB Mediation is becoming the premier method of resolving disputes within the construction industry. The linchpin to the mediation process is the mediator. An effective mediator may make the difference between mediation success or failure. Yet, considering the importance of an effective mediator, there is a dearth of information as to the attributes of one and how to recognize and retain one. Considering the importance of mediation in the arbitration process as well as the trend toward court ordered mediation, it behooves industry members to understand the attributes of an effective mediator. This paper will discuss the skills an effective mediator needs to assist the parties in moving forward, crafting a sustainable settlement as well as leave the disputing parties and their counsel satisfied with the process and result. It will alert readers what to look for when engaging a mediator's service and what questions need to be asked in the quest for the effective mediator to assist in the resolution of disputes.

AB A new mobile instrumentation that takes advantage of the simultaneous utilisation of two micro-analytical techniques (Raman and XRF) has already been effected within the PRAXIS European project (Competitive and Sustainable growth programme, PRAXIS: A portable Raman-X-Ray instrument. No G6RD-CT-2001-00602). The instrument permits structural characterisation of the pigments incorporated in a painting under study by evaluation of the Raman spectra together with elemental analysis of the same materials provided by XRF spectra. Although direct structural characterisation with great specificity is directly accomplished by Raman spectroscopy, the signal is often masked by strong fluorescence, a fact that imposes time consumption. On the other hand, the average signal offered by XRF over larger volumes enables unique information to be obtained from invisible under-layers. Moreover, the detection of trace elements by XRF, not influencing the Raman spectra, renders the characterisation of painting materials more comprehensive. Validation of the instrument's in situ and non-destructive capabilities was performed after its in vitro application on an experimental icon (painted with traditional Byzantine techniques). The data acquired by the two techniques from the same spots on the painting offer complementary results, which enable the identification of almost all pigments even in the case of over-painted art objects. Finally, the instrument's abilities on the identification of materials on specimen's cross sections are revealed. Copyright (C) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI Ecological citizenship and sustainable consumption: Examining local
   organic food networks
SO JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
ID POLITICS; UK; EMBEDDEDNESS
AB Sustainable consumption is gaining in currency as a new environmental policy objective. This paper presents new research findings from a mixed-method empirical study of a local organic food network to interrogate the theories of both sustainable consumption and ecological citizenship. It describes a mainstream policy model of sustainable consumption, and contrasts this with an alternative model derived from green or 'new economics' theories. Then the role of localised, organic food networks is discussed to locate them within the alternative model. It then tests the hypothesis that ecological citizenship is a driving force for 'alternative' sustainable consumption, via expression through consumer behaviour such as purchasing local organic food. The empirical study found that both the organisation and their consumers were expressing ecological citizenship values in their activities in a number of clearly identifiable ways, and that the initiative was actively promoting the growth of ecological citizenship, as well as providing a meaningful social context for its expression. Furthermore, the initiative was able to overcome the structural limitations of mainstream sustainable consumption practices. Thus, the initiative was found to be a valuable tool for practising alternative sustainable consumption. The paper concludes with a discussion of how ecological citizenship may be a powerful motivating force for sustainable consumption behaviour, and the policy and research implications of this.

TI Objective and subjective analysis of effects of listening angle on
   crosstalk cancellation in spatial sound reproduction
SO JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA
LA English
DT Article
ID LOUDSPEAKERS; ROBUSTNESS; SYSTEMS; STEREO
AB A comprehensive study was conducted to explore. the effects of listening angle on crosstalk cancellation in spatial sound reproduction using two-channel stereo systems. The intention is to establish a sustainable configuration of crosstalk cancellation system (CCS) that best reconciles the separation performance and the robustness against lateral head movement, not only in theory but also in practice. Although crosstalk can in principle be suppressed using multichannel inverse filters, the CCS does not lend itself very well to practical application owing to the fact that the sweet spot is being so small. Among the parameters of loudspeaker deployment, span angle is a crucial factor that has a profound impact on the separation performance and sweet spot robustness achievable by the CCS This paper seeks to pinpoint, from a more comprehensive perspective, the optimal listening angle that best reconciles the robustness and performance of the CCS. Two kinds of definitions of sweet spot are employed for assessment of robustness. In addition to the point source model, head related transfer functions (HRTF) are employed as the plant models in the simulation to emulate more practical localization scenarios such as the high-frequency head shadowing effect. Three span angles including 10, 60, and 120 deg are then compared via objective and subjective experiments. The Friedman test is applied to analyze the data of subjective experiments. The results indicate that not only the CCS performance but also the panning effect and head shadowing will dictate the overall performance and robustness. The 120-deg arrangement performs comparably well as the standard 60-deg arrangement, but is much better than the 10-deg arrangement. (c) 2006 Acoustical Society of America.

AB In this study, an overview of the current species composition of ophiuroids off Helgoland, German Bight (North Sea) is given. In addition, abundance and distribution of ophiuroids on different types of soft bottom sediments taken by van Veen grab samples around Helgoland were recorded. The literature was reviewed in order to outline the diversity of ophiuroid species over the past 130 years lit the inner German Bight. In the historical literature, quantitative references often apply to verbal descriptions and thus make comparisons to modern data and assessment of possible changes in abundance rather subjective.
   In total, six ophiuroid species were identified off Helgoland: Acrocnida brachiata, Amphiura filiformis, Amphipholis squamata, Ophiothrix fragilis, Ophiura albida and Ophiura ophiura. The species found in this study had also been reported by previous investigators and are regarded as 'common' species in the German Bight. Occasional findings in this area refer to Amphiura chiajei, Ophiopholis aculeata, Ophiocten affinis and Ophiura sarsi, which are regarded here as 'rare' species. These findings, however, do not indicate sustainable changes lit the species diversity over time.
   Apart from Acrocnida brachiata, a newcomer in the 1970s, findings of the common species mentioned above can be dated back to 1875. Therefore, a fairly stable composition of brittle stars is represented in the inner German Bight during the past 130 years.

AB Terrestrial ecosystems originate when particular plant species attain dominance at specific locations under specific environmental regimes. Ecosystems terminate, gradually or abruptly, when the dominant species or functional types are replaced by others, usually owing to environmental change or severe and irreversible disturbance. Assessing whether current ecosystems are sustainable in the face of future environmental change can be aided by examining the range of environmental variation those ecosystems have experienced in the past, and by determining the environmental conditions under which those ecosystems arose. The range of environmental variation depends on the time scale at which it is assessed. A narrow time span (e.g. 200-300 years) may underestimate the range of variation within which an ecosystem is sustainable, and it may also underestimate the risk of major transformation or disruption of that ecosystem by environmental change. Longer time spans (e.g. 1000-2000 years) increase the range of variation, by encompassing a larger sample of natural variability as well as non-stationary variability in the earth system. Most modem ecosystems disappear when the time span is expanded to 10000-15 000 years owing to secular changes in earth's climate system. Paleo-ecological records can pinpoint the time of origination of specific ecosystems, and paleo-environ mental records can reveal the specific environmental changes that led to development of those ecosystems and the range of environmental variation under which those ecosystems have maintained themselves in the past. This information can help identify critical environmental thresholds beyond which specific modem ecosystems can no longer be sustained.

ID POPULATION PRESSURE; AGRICULTURAL CHANGE; SALINITY; PEASANT; ASIA
AB This paper examines the impact of shrimp farming on rice ecosystem in a village in Southwestern Bangladesh. The village Damarpota has experienced transformation of 274ha (79%) of its prime quality rice fields into shrimp farms during the period between 1985 and 2003. Prolonged shrimp farming for 5-, 10-, and 15-year period has increased soil salinity, acidity, and depleted soil Ca, K, Mg, and organic C content of all three types of soils in the villages to a variable degree and caused soil degradation that significantly affected the rice yield. Declined yield and acreage of rice jointly reduced the total production of rice and animal fodder. Soil degradation and loss of acreage under rice have threatened the sustainability of the village rice ecosystem. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we present a Danish case study of the effectiveness and costs of protecting nitrogen poor nature areas vulnerable to ammonia eutrophication by appointing buffer zones around them. Buffer zones are found to be an important step towards sustainable co-existence of intensive livestock production and nature conservation when local sources are important contributors to eutrophication. Depending on the deposition patterns, buffer zones may be cost-effective compared to re-establishment of eutrophicated locations, but a need for further model analysis is also identified.

AB The decline in agricultural and other forms of rural employment in many countries has created a need for a diversified range of rural businesses. In most cases, agritourism has become an important element of the diverse activities in rural areas of Taiwan. However, there are a number of significant impacts from tourism activities that can be influenced by agritourism policy.
   Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) is a procedural tool to assess policies and can aid the development of more sustainable policy formulation. However, SEA aims to assess environmental impacts; the health issues are often overlooked. Hence, a Delphi-Indicator approach to SEA is proposed here to integrate Health Impact Assessment (HIA). This new approach is based on the impact indicator system, and then the Delphi method is employed to collect experts' opinions. After the evaluation system was established, the current agritourism policy and another alternative policy are assessed to examine this new method.
   Finally, various types of impacts from current agritourism policy in Taiwan are identified, and the significant impacts are as follows: resources usage (water, electricity, petroleum), pollution generation (waste, noise), and other landscape problems (mudflows and landslide, harmony of the rural landscape). In addition, several benefits are found from the alternative policy (agro-ecotourism) such as the amount of pesticides used per unit area, and environmental quality of local community since agro-ecotourism development is based on organic agriculture and combination with ecotourism to provide acceptable recreation opportunity without destroying natural rural environment. In summary, the impacts are less significant from agro-ecotourism than those from current agritourism policy, and these positive changes are not only in the environmental sector, but also within the economic, social, and health issues.

ID INFRASTRUCTURE; TRANSFORMATION; REFORM; CITY
AB China's economic reforms over the past decades have given rise to the development of a rudimentary urban land market. Although one cannot speak of a land "market" in the strict sense of the word, there is an urban land allocation system in which land lease rights can be acquired through the payment of a land-use fee. If the urban land market is to develop in a sustainable manner, new credible institutions need to be established that can safeguard greater legal security and transparency. For these purposes, it is necessary to establish a management system that can support the legal (tenure security), economic (leases, taxes) and broader aspects (spatial and environmental land use policies) of land administration. To make an urban land administration system socially credible and functional, land-related information should be registered and structured at a detailed spatial level, such as parcels. There is no parcel-based information system in China, but the country has developed a population registration system at a detailed spatial level that could be a starting point to develop integrated information systems, or a so-called "local spatial data infrastructure". This paper reviews China's population registration system and their spatial units and presents a proposal for an information system that can be expanded or adapted to meet the requirements of an effective land administration system.

AB Adopted in Florence (Italy) on 20 October 2000, the European Landscape Convention is aimed at promoting the protection, management and planning of European landscapes and organising European cooperation on landscape issues. It is the first international treaty to be exclusively concerned with all dimensions of European landscape. It applies to the entire territory of the Parties and relates to natural, urban and peri-urban areas, whether on land, water or sea. It therefore concerns not just remarkable landscapes but also ordinary everyday landscapes and blighted areas. The Convention represents an important contribution to the implementation of the objectives of the Council of Europe: these seek to protect Europeans' quality of life and well-being, taking into account landscape, cultural and natural values. The member states of the Council of Europe signatory to the European Landscape Convention declared their concern to achieve sustainable development based on a balanced and harmonious relationship between social needs, economic activity and the environment. The cultural dimension is also of fundamental importance.

AB We investigate how a firm's birthright can determine its competitive advantage and its ability to survive an industry shakeout, especially when caused by non-disruptive technological innovations. Birthright is defined as the firm's superior endowment of resources, both tangible and intangible, vis-a-vis competitors', stemming either from its earlier entry into the market or from prior experience in a related market. Using a system dynamics simulation case analysis, we show that, consistent with the literature, birthright was indeed the determining force during the consolidation of the Korean mobile telecom industry case, and that firm's reputation or brand was the significant factor. We then consider a deeper question, whether it is possible for newcomers without strong birthrights to survive such industry turmoil. We use the simulation model to conduct a 'what-if' analysis on one of the 'victim' firms which failed in the Korean telecoms shakeout, and conclude that targeted investment in reputation building would have enabled it to survive.

DE Waste Input-Output analysis; landfilled waste; landfill inining
AB New environmental assessment model based on the Waste Input-Output analysis has been developed and applied for the "Landfill mining activity" for the recovery of valuable materials and energy resources and the saving of landfill site.
   In this study, the landfilled wastes are assumed to be treated by the gasification/melting processes. Two kinds of reactors, the fluidized bed type and the shaft furnace type, have been considered in this work as the typical gasification/melting processes adopted in Japan. Both processes generate electric power by the recovered heat and fly ash as waste to be landfilled. It has been found in this study that the both processes can reduce the total volume of waste and save the available landfill space. The shaft furnace type seems to have higher potential for decreasing volume of wastes because of less emission than the fluidized bed type. The results of scenario analysis have also indicated that the landfill mining activity is effective for sustainable management of landfill sites.

AB Regeneration of the chromophore 11-cis-retinal is essential for the generation of light-sensitive visual pigments in the vertebrate retina. A deficiency in 11-cis-retinal production leads to congenital blindness in humans; however, a buildup of the photoisomerized chromophore can also be detrimental. Such is the case when the photoisomerized all-trans-retinal is produced but cannot be efficiently cleared from the internal membrane of the outer segment discs. Sustained increase of all-trans-retinal can lead to the formation of toxic condensation products in the eye. Thus, there is a need for potent, selective inhibitors that can regulate the flux of retinoids through the metabolism pathway termed the visual (retinoid) cycle. Here we systematically study the effects of the most potent inhibitor of this cycle, retinylamine (Ret-NH2), on visual function in mice. Prolonged, sustainable, but reversible suppression of the visual function was observed by Ret-NH2 as a result of its storage in a prodrug form, N-retinylamides. Direct comparison of other inhibitors such as fenretinide and 13-cis-retinoic acid showed multiple advantages of Ret-NH2 and its amides, including a higher potency, specificity, and lower transcription activation. Our results also revealed that mice treated with Ret-NH2 were completely resistant to the light-induced retina damage. As an experimental tool, Ret-NH2 allows the replacement of the native chromophore with synthetic analogs in wild-type mice to better understand the function of the chromophore in the activation of rhodopsin and its metabolism through the retinoid cycle.

TI Making the brand: Using brand management to encourage market acceptance
   of forestry certification
SO NEW YORK UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB Forestry certification seeks to lessen the environmental impacts of private forestry management practices by providing information to consumers. Certified producers attach a uniform label to their wood products to assure buyers that the products were produced in a sustainable manner. In the United States, forestry certification has existed for more than a decade, yet industry participation in such programs remains low. This Note argues that low industry participation results from a lack of consumer demand for certified forestry products and the failure of certification stakeholders to address this lack of demand. While there are many obstacles to increasing consumer demand, this Note suggests that brand management concepts taken from the field of marketing can help tackle these challenges and, in turn, help increase market acceptance of forestry certification in the United States.

TI Students' perception of the psycho-social clinical learning environment:
   An evolution of placement models
SO NURSE EDUCATION TODAY
LA English
DT Article
DE student; nurses; clinical; placement
ID EXPERIENCES; INVENTORY
AB Nursing is a practice based discipline. A supportive environment has been identified as important for the transfer of learning in the clinical context. The aim of the paper was to assess undergraduate nurses' perceptions of the psychosocial characteristics of clinical learning environments within three different clinical placement models. Three hundred and eight-nine undergraduate nursing students rated their perceptions of the psycho-social learning environment using a Clinical Learning Environment Inventory. There were 16 respondents in the Preceptor model category, 269 respondents in the Facilitation model category and 114 respondents in the clinical education unit model. across 25 different clinical areas in one tertiary facility. The most positive social climate was associated with the preceptor model. On all subscales the median score was rated higher than the two other models. When clinical education units were compared with the standard facilitation model the median score was rated higher in all of the subscales in the Clinical Learning Environment Inventory. These results suggest that white preceptoring is an effective clinical placement strategy that provides psycho-social support for students, clinical education units that are more sustainable through their placement of greater numbers of students, can provide greater psycho-social support for students than traditional models.

ID RESPONSIVENESS
AB Background Persistent low back pain is a major health and socio-economic problem in the UK. Evidence-based guidelines have been produced to inform management strategies for this significant health issue. This study reports the outcome of a tertiary intervention functional restoration programme (FRP) in manual workers of a water utility company, consistent with UK guidelines.
   Objectives To evaluate whether a FRP could achieve a sustainable improvement in back health, a sustainable return to full duties and a cost reduction.
   Method Participants were assessed at start, end, 12 and 24 months post-programme.
   Results Eighty-nine employees completed the FRP; 78 returned to normal duties, nine to restricted duties and two left the employer shortly after. Overall, there were significant improvements in psychological status, perceived pain, disability and work capability. Improvements were sustained for 24 months. Sickness absence and the need for post-treatment work restrictions decreased. Reductions in ill-health retirements and compensation claims for low back pain were reduced.
   Conclusion The findings support the effectiveness of a tertiary intervention FRP for workers with persistent low back pain.

AB Density dependence of the Addo Elephant National Park (South Africa) elephants Loxodonta africana was assessed using a long-term data set. Estimated carrying capacity is 0.1-0.5 elephants km(-2) but stocking rates have been up to 4 elephants km(-2). Population growth rate was found to be positively correlated with increasing density. There was no relationship between birth rate, the age of first calving or calf sex ratio and elephant density but there was a positive relationship between birth rate and rainfall during conception year. Mortality rates, particularly for juveniles, were low, and mean inter-calf interval was 3.3 years. There is no evidence of density dependent regulation in this population, despite the population being consistently above the estimated sustainable carrying capacity and a loss of phytomass and biodiversity. This is interpreted in light of the characteristics of the aseasonal habitat, succulent thicket vegetation and the ability of elephants to utilize accumulated vegetation biomass. These findings indicate that density dependence should not be considered as an option in the control of elephant numbers in this Park, or where elephant resources are not seasonally limited.

AB Although understood differently in different parts of the world, conservation tillage usually includes leaving crop residues on the soil surface to reduce tillage. Through a global review of long-term conservation tillage research, this paper discusses the long-term effect of conservation tillage on sustainable land use, nutrient availability and crop yield response. Research has shown several potential benefits associated with conservation tillage, such as potential carbon sequestration, nutrient availability, and yield response. This research would provide a better perspective of the role of soil conservation tillage and hold promise in promoting application of practical technologies for dryland farming systems in China.

TI Four fundamental elements for the public, democratic and civic
   management of water
SO PENSEE
LA French
DT Article
AB The four fundamental elements of democratic public water management are ethical, ecological, social and political. By themselves, each of these elements should suffice to support this proposition. Water has the peculiarity that it is at once a gift of nature and also one of nature's fundamental constituents : without it, there would be no nature. The need for water is not only shared by all living creatures but also the fundamental condition for life itself. Water is life and the awe with which we humans owe it should contribute to the development of sustainable policies for the preservation and management of an essential resource.

AB This study characterized genetically 30 fast-growing rhizobial strains isolated from nodules of Asian and modern soybean genotypes that had been inoculated with soils from disparate regions of Brazil. Analyses by rep-PCR (ERIC and REP) and RAPD indicated a high level of genetic diversity among the strains. The RFLP-PCR and sequencing analysis of the 16S rRNA genes indicated that none of the strains was related to Sinorhizobium (Ensifer) fredii, whereas most were related to Rhizobium tropici (although they were unable to nodulate Phaseolus vulgaris) and to Rhizobium genomic species Q. One strain was related to Rhizobium sp. OR 191, while two others were closely related to Agrobacterium (Rhizobium) spp.; furthermore, symbiotic effectiveness with soybean was maintained in those strains. Five strains were related to Bradyrhizobium japonicum and B. elkanii, with four of them being similar to strains carried in Brazilian inoculants, therefore modifications in physiological properties, as a shorter doubling time might have resulted from adaptation to local conditions. Phospholipid fatty acid analysis (PFLA) was less precise in delineating taxonomic relationships. The strains fit into eight Nod-factor profiles that were related to rhizobial species, but not to N-2-fixation capacity or competitiveness. The data obtained highlight the diversity and promiscuity of rhizobia in the tropics, being capable of nodulating exotic legumes and might reflect ecological strategies to survive in N-poor soils; in addition, the diversity could also represent an important source of efficient and competitive rhizobial strains for the tropics. Putative new rhizobial species were detected only in undisturbed soils. Three species (R. tropici, B. j. apom. cum and B. elkanii) were found under the more sustainable management system known as no-till, while the only species isolated from soils under conventional till was R. tropici. Those results emphasize that from the moment that agriculture was introduced into undisturbed soils rhizobial diversity has changed, being drastically reduced when a less sustainable soil management system was adopted.

AB Conventional evolutionary game theory predicts that natural selection favours the selfish and strong even though cooperative interactions thrive at all levels of organization in living systems. Recent investigations demonstrated that a limiting factor for the evolution of cooperative interactions is the way in which they are organized, cooperators becoming evolutionarily competitive whenever individuals are constrained to interact with few others along the edges of networks with low average connectivity. Despite this insight, the conundrum of cooperation remains since recent empirical data shows that real networks exhibit typically high average connectivity and associated single-to-broad scale heterogeneity. Here, a computational model is constructed in which individuals are able to self-organize both their strategy and their social ties throughout evolution, based exclusively on their self-interest. We show that the entangled evolution of individual strategy and network structure constitutes a key mechanism for the sustainability of cooperation in social networks. For a given average connectivity of the population, there is a critical value for the ratio W between the time scales associated with the evolution of strategy and of structure above which cooperators wipe out defectors. Moreover, the emerging social networks exhibit an overall heterogeneity that accounts very well for the diversity of patterns recently found in acquired data on social networks. Finally, heterogeneity is found to become maximal when W reaches its critical value. These results show that simple topological dynamics reflecting the individual capacity for self-organization of social ties can produce realistic networks of high average connectivity with associated single-to-broad-scale heterogeneity. On the other hand, they show that cooperation cannot evolve as a result of "social viscosity'' alone in heterogeneous networks with high average connectivity, requiring the additional mechanism of topological co-evolution to ensure the survival of cooperative behaviour.

TI Accreditation as a regulatory option for Antarctic bioprospecting
SO POLAR RECORD
LA English
DT Article
AB The current lack of a specific policy regime for Antarctic biological prospecting (bioprospecting) has emerged as a focus of recent discussion. Consideration has been given to the interface of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and the Antarctic Treaty System (ATS). This paper aims to introduce the potential for industry accreditation to address existing regulatory uncertainty. The Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) accreditation for sustainable fisheries and the accreditation scheme being developed for Antarctic tour operators provide examples of industry accreditation that interplay with the Antarctic Treaty System. Accreditation may provide an avenue for industry to promote legitimate activities, demonstrate willingness to comply with existing principles and established regulations while the perception of being over-regulated is potentially reduced. Accreditation may also serve as an is not without its limitations, it does provide an avenue for the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties (ATCPs) to engage industry stakeholders, clarify existing obligations and promote a regulatory initiative in conformity with the principles of the Antarctic Treaty System.

AB This article draws on the policy experience of a range of countries to argue that different approaches to pension reform reflect national values and culture that become embedded in pension arrangements and take on their own momentum. This is illustrated with examples drawn from Australia and China on the role of means testing and the balance between formal and informal means of support in old age. Pension reform must address demographic change and be financially sound, but must also be politically sustainable. Challenges exist, but to portray these as a 'crisis' does little to aid the search for sensible responses.

AB The establishment of a sustainable energy future is one of the most pressing tasks of mankind. With the exhaustion of fossil resources the energy economy will change from a chemical to an electrical base. This transition is one of physics, not one of politics. It must be based on proven technology and existing engineering experience. The transition process will take many years and should start soon. Unfortunately, politics seems to listen to the advice of visionaries and lobby groups. Many of their qualitative arguments are not based on facts and physics. A secure sustainable energy future cannot be based on hype and activism, but has to be built on solid grounds of established science and engineering. In this paper the energy needs of a hydrogen economy are quantified. Only 20%-25% of the source energy needed to synthesized hydrogen from natural compounds can be recovered for end use by efficient fuel cells. Because of the high energy losses within a hydrogen economy the synthetic energy carrier cannot compete with electricity. As the fundamental laws of physics cannot be chanced by research, politics or investments, a hydrogen economy will never make sense.

AB Most of the 60+ developing countries that have established social funds (SFs) are decentralising their governments as well. But the question of how to tailor SFs-originally a highly centralised model-for a decentralising context has received relatively little attention in the literature. We first examine evidence on the ability of SFs to adapt to a decentralised context. We then lay out the implications of decentralisation for SF institutional design step-by-step through the project cycle. The topic is doubly important because social funds can increase their effectiveness, and the sustainability of their investments, by reorganising internal processes to take advantage of the political and civic institutions that decentralisation creates. Local government has an informational advantage in local needs and characteristics (time and place), whereas SFs have access to better technology and knowledge of sectoral best practice. The key is to create institutional incentives that best combine these relative advantages. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI Sustainable waste management in the UK: the public health role

ID CLIMATE-CHANGE; ENVIRONMENT; ISSUES; RISK
AB This paper discusses waste management in the UK and its relationship with health. It aims to outline the role of health professionals in the promotion of waste management, and argues for a change in their role in waste management regulation to help make the process more sustainable.
   The most common definition of sustainable development is that by the Brundtland commission, i.e. 'development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs'. Managing waste sites in a manner that minimises toxic impacts on the current and future generations is obviously a crucial part of this. Although the management of waste facilities is extremely complex, the Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control regime, which requires the input of public health professionals on the regulation of such sites, means that all waste management installations should now be operating in a fashion that minimises any toxicological risks to human health.
   However, the impacts upon climate change, resource use and health inequalities, as well as the effects of waste transportation, are currently not considered to be part of public health professionals' responsibilities when dealing with these sites. There is also no requirement for public health professionals to become involved in waste management planning issues. The fact that public health professionals are not involved in any of these issues makes it unlikely that the potential impacts upon health are being considered fully, and even more unlikely that waste management will become more sustainable.
   This paper aims to show that by only considering direct toxicological impacts, public health professionals are not fully addressing all the health issues and are not contributing towards sustainability. There is a need for a change in the way that health professionals deal with waste management issues. (c) 2006 The Royal Institute of Public Health. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Cellulose is a biodegradable polymer produced sustainably in large quantities by nature. It has been used by mankind for centuries because of its favorable properties, but suffers disadvantages such as the high cost of production and limited processibility. For example, it cannot be melted and is only soluble in less common solvents. The latter limitation can be overcome through appropriate derivatization of cellulose, which increases the solubility range and may generate thermoplastic materials. This paper will review three new developments leading to enhanced utilization of cellulosics.
   Firstly, an overview is given of the progress in the formulation of fiber-reinforced thermoplastic cellulose composites to facilitate extrusion processing. Cellulose-polypropylene composites show enhanced properties in comparison with neat polypropylene, and offer scope for replacing composites containing glass fibers, owing to resultant advantages in weight, recyclability, and ease of disposal. Progress is also reported in improving the predictability of essential physical quantities and melt flow in cellulose esters. Finally, an account is given of the successful development of microcrystalline cellulose (CFM) derivatives, synthesized in a heterogeneous manner, as chiral recognition agents in liquid chromatography. The structural features of these materials are decisive for their use. A model is proposed for the morphology of the cellulosic fibrils.

AB Convective systems over sub-Saharan Africa and the tropical East Atlantic have distinct geographical and seasonal variations in convective intensity and stratiform precipitation production as observed by the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Precipitation Radar. Over the East Atlantic, convective rain rates are lower and the percentage of total rain that is stratiform is higher compared to over West Africa. In addition, the East Atlantic has more shallow precipitating convection and less non-precipitating anvil than sub-Saharan Africa. During the monsoon season, convective rain rates and the percentage of area covered by anvil decrease while the stratiform rain fraction and number of shallow convective cells increase in both regions compared to the pre-monsoon season. These observations suggest that convective sustainability, i.e. the ability of a region to continually support convection, helps determine whether a robust stratiform rain area or non-precipitating anvil forms.
   In addition to convective sustainability, wind shear and the Saharan Air Layer appear to play important roles in the formation and extent of the stratiform components of convective cloud systems. Strong winds associated with the African Easterly Jet and dry intrusions from the Sahara Desert may increase sublimation and evaporation at mid levels, resulting in less stratiform rain. Strong upper-level shear associated with the African Easterly Jet may further hinder stratiform rain production by displacing hydrometeors that form in the convective cells beyond the area of mesoscale rain formation. When the upper-level Tropical Easterly Jet strengthens during the monsoon season, upper-level shear is reduced dramatically and stratiform rain areas form in preference to non-raining anvil.

AB Volcanic soil can be used to remove metals from wastewaters. Once used, it is disposed in landfills. The utilization of this material in the cement industry as an alternative raw material was evaluated using life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology. This possibility has been studied from an environmental point of view in a Chilean cement facility, representative of the current operation state of art, including both technical and economic analysis. Two scenarios were compared: Scenario 1, which corresponds to the existing cement production process, and Scenario 2, which represents cement production using spent volcanic soil. With the exception of the categories of carcinogens (C) and minerals (M), the comparative results are favourable to Scenario 2, specially regarding to the category of ecotoxicity (E), mainly due to the avoided landfilling emissions of the volcanic soil. When considering the damage assessment, damage to human health (HH), ecosystem quality (EQ) and resources (R) are lower in Scenario 2. In addition, sensitivity analyses were performed to study the influence of particular parameters (i.e., transport of spent volcanic Soil, CO2 emissions from the clinkerization process and heavy metals leaching from the spent volcanic soil) on the results of the assessment. The use of alternative raw materials (in this case, spent volcanic soil), which present the advantage to be wastes from other technical systems, appear to allow the development of cement production in a more sustainable way, slightly improving the economy of the process. The spent volcanic soil can be treated with zero cost for the wastewater treatment plant with savings of 0.23EURO for each tonne of clinker production. Establishing a sound management way for the spent volcanic soil could foment its possible use as mineral adsorbent in industrial wastewater treatment facilities. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

ID PROMOTION
AB Background: Public health stakeholders are concerned about program sustainability. However, they usually conceive sustainability in accordance with financial criteria for at least one reason. No simple frameworks are operationally and theoretically sound enough to globally evaluate program sustainability. The present paper aims to describe an application of one framework assessment tool used to evaluate the sustainability level and process of a Nutritional Care Unit managed by a Swiss humanitarian agency to fight against severe child malnutrition in a Haitian area. The managing agency is committed to put this Unit back into the structure of a local public hospital.
   Methods: The evaluation was performed within the sustainability, framework proposed in a former article. Data were collected with a combination of tools, semi-structured interviews (n=33, medical and support staff from the agency and the hospital), participatory observation and document review. Data concerned the four characteristics of organizational routines (memory, adaptation, values and rules) enabling assess to the level of sustainability. In addition, data were related to three types of events distinguishing routinization processes from implementation processes: specific events of routinization, routinization-implementation joint events, and specific events of implementation. Data analysis was thematic and results were validated by actors through a feed-back session and written comments.
   Results: The current level of sustainability of the Nutritional Care Unit within the Hospital is weak: weak memory, high adaptation, weak sharing of values and rules. This may be explained by the sustainability process, and the absence of specific routinization events. The relevance of such processes is reasonable, while it has been strongly challenged in the troublesome Haitian context. Riots have been widespread over the last years, creating difficulties for the Hospital.
   Conclusion: This experience suggests the proposed framework and sustainability assessment tools are useful when the context permits scrutinization of program sustainability.

AB The climate change problem must be thought of in terms of risk, not certainty. There are many well-established elements of the problem that carry considerable confidence whereas some aspects are speculative. Therefore, the climate problem emerges not simply as a normal science research issue, but as a risk management policy debate as well. Descriptive science entails using empirical and theoretical methods to quantify the two factors that go into risk assessment: "What can happen?" and "What are the odds?" (Probability x Consequences).
   Policymakers should, in turn, take that information and use it to make value judgments about what is safe, what is dangerous, what is fair. To make these judgments, policymakers need to know the probabilities that experts assign to various possible outcomes in order to make risk management decisions to hedge against unsafe, dangerous and unfair outcomes. The climate debate needs to be refrained away from absolute costs-or benefits-into relative delay times to achieve specific caps or to avoid crossing specific agreed "dangerous" climate change thresholds. Even in most optimistic scenarios, CO2 will stabilize at a much higher concentration than it has reached today, and temperature will rise accordingly. It will take even longer for sea level rise from thermal expansion and the melting of polar ice to occur, but what is most problematic is that how we handle our emissions now and in the next five decades preconditions the sustainability of the next millennium.

AB Since the 1960s, dramatic changes have taken place in land-use patterns characterized by the persistent expansion of cultivated land and a continuous decrease in natural woodland and grassland in the and inland river basins of China. It is very important to assess the effects of such land-use changes on the hydrological processes so vital for water resource management and sustainable development on the catchment scale. The Maying River catchment, a typical and inland watershed located in the middle of the Hexi Corridor in northwest China, was the site chosen to investigate the hydrological responses to land-use changes. The annual runoff, base flow, maximum peak flow, and typical seasonal runoff in both spring and autumn flood periods were selected as the variables in the hydrological processes. Statistical-trend analysis and curvilinear regression were utilized to detect the trends in hydrological variables while eliminating the climatic influence. The relationship between cultivated land-use and hydrological variables was analyzed based on four periods of land-use variation data collected since 1965. A runoff model was established composed of two factors, i.e., cultivated land use and precipitation. The impact of land use changes, especially in the large areas of upstream woodland and grassland turned into cultivated lands since 1967, has resulted in a mean annual runoff decrease of 28.12%, a base flow decline of 35.32%, a drop in the maximum peak discharge of 35.77%, and mean discharge decreases in spring and autumn of 36.05% and 24.87% respectively, of which the contribution of cultivated land expansion to the influence of annual runoff amounts to 77%-80%, with the contribution to the influence of spring discharge being 73%-81%, and that to the influence of base flow reaching 62%-65%. Thus, a rational regulation policy of land use patterns is vitally important to the sustainable use of water resources and the proper development of the entire catchment.

AB Phosphorus (P) losses caused by intensive agriculture are known to have potentially large negative effects on the water quality of lakes. However, due to the buffering capacity of soils and lake ecosystems, such effects may appear long after intensive agriculture started. Here we present the study of a coupled shallow lake catchment model, which allows a glimpse of the magnitude of these buffer-related time delays.
   Results show that the buffering capacity of the lake water was negligible whereas buffering in the lake sediment postponed the final lake equilibrium for several decades. The surface soil layer in contact with runoff water was accountable for a delay of 550 years. The most important buffer, however, was the percolation soil layer that may cause a delay of 150-1700 years depending on agricultural P surplus levels. Although the buffers could postpone final lake equilibria for a considerable time, current and target agricultural surplus levels eventually led to very turbid conditions with total P concentrations of 2.0 and 0.6 mg L-1 respectively. To secure permanent clear water states the current agricultural P surplus of 15 kg P ha(-1) yr(-1) should drop to 0.7 kg P ha(-1) yr(-1). We present several simple equations that can be used to estimate the sustainable P surplus levels, buffer related time delays and equilibrium P concentrations in other catchment-lake systems.

AB We investigate the implications of two protective properties, sustainability and exemption, for the resolution of conflicting claims. Under the properties, agents with sufficiently small claims in relation to the other claims and to the amount available are fully reimbursed. Our main results are three characterizations of the constrained equal awards rule. Namely, (1) it is the only rule satisfying sustainability and claims monotonicity, (2) it is the only rule satisfying sustainability and super-modularity, and (3) it is the only rule satisfying exemption, order preservation, and consistency.

AB The labor quality index (LQI) not only serves as an important reference for monitoring the progress of the sustainable development of a country, but it can also serve as an important parameter for economic analysis. To compile such an index for Taiwan, we conducted two large-scale surveys of 1000 major enterprises and 844 union leaders, respectively, to determine the appropriate weights for each key factor. We also searched for all the relevant statistics that were used to calculate the weighted sum of the 25 sub-indexes, in order to compile a LQI for Taiwan's manufacturing industries covering the period from 1990-2000. Our calculations show that this LQI rose from 80.2 in 1990 to 117.5 in 2000, which reflected an impressive 37.3% increase in just one decade. This rate of growth has, however, been slowing down since 1997. Our results indicate that the LQI provides a valuable indicator for monitoring the enhancement of labor quality in this society.

AB Aquaculture is heralded as a way of helping to feed a growing global population by supplementing supplies of wild-sourced seafood. Australian aquaculture has the potential to become a $1 billion per year industry and to provide employment needed in some rural areas. However, concerns about aquaculture have led to disputes about the industry's access to highly valued marine and coastal environments. The lack of research on this topic has confounded efforts to build a more socially acceptable and sustainable aquaculture industry. This research used key stakeholder interviews and a household mail survey to reveal differences in perceptions of aquaculture risks. Community groups (particularly conservation), ecotourism industries, researchers, some state and local government staff, and informed members of the general public were more likely to focus on aquaculture's risks, and seek improvements in aquaculture planning and management to substantially reduce those risks and make the industry more acceptable to diverse interests.

ID PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT; POLICY
AB Forest management in Canada is evolving from being largely bilateral and closed to being more inclusive and open. In an effort to test new approaches to public participation, many forest products companies have established advisory committees. Since there is little empirical evidence documenting advisory committee processes, our purpose was to determine the strengths and weaknesses of such processes. This was achieved by assessing the advisory committees of three major forest products companies in Manitoba, Canada, responsible for managing over 5 million hectares of productive forest. Our approach was inductive and qualitative, involving standardized, semistructured interviews with committee members. Results coalesce around both process and outcome strengths and weaknesses, such as multiple involvement techniques, information sharing and communication, and breadth of participant learning. While the results are mixed, the study confirms that advisory committees have promise as a method of actively involving a select group of stakeholders in forest management.

AB Angola is recovering from nearly 30 years of war that has left the country without food, education, and economic means. The ProPlanalto Project of WorldVision, Chevron-Texaco, US Agency for International Development, and three Angolan institutions (The Agricultural Research Service, Instituto de Investigacoes Agronomicas; the Agricultural University, Agostinho Neto University, and the Extension Service, Instituto de Desenvolvimento Agronomica) was organized to begin the restoration of the highly successful prewar agricultural production systems to end the famine that has struck many Angolan families and households. Modern varieties of maize, potato, and beans were brought in, local seed producers were found, fertilizer experiments were conducted, and a soils laboratory was constructed, furnished, equipped, and supplied. A goal of the Soil Management Collaborative Research Support Program intervention was to assist in this restoration by illustrating and training in the use of information technologies and participatory development to improve the provision and management of nutrients and fertilizers. Information technology tools, such as decision aids and geospatial analysis, were introduced. Participatory methods of using soil test kits, farmer-to-farmer visits, and farmer empowerment were used to used to illustrate that the country and its scientists can leapfrog into use of current technology and knowledge management skills if they so choose. Maize yields of up to 9000 kg ha(-1) and potato yields as high as 16,000 kg ha(-1) were obtained under ideal conditions. Indications are that irrigation is available during the dry season, potentially providing sustainable water supply for year-round irrigation. Soils from the experimental sites were characterized using Soil Taxonomy to facilitate sharing of production system technology and expertise.

AB Background and Purpose-There is no consensus about indicators for measuring quality of acute stroke care in Germany. Therefore, a standardized process was initiated recently to develop and implement evidence-based indicators for the measurement of quality of acute hospital stroke care.
   Methods-Quality indicators were developed by a multidisciplinary board between November 2003 and December 2005. The process was initiated by the German Stroke Registers Study Group in cooperation with the German Stroke Society, the German Society of Neurology, the German Stroke Foundation, Regional Offices for Quality Assurance and other experts proven in the field. National and international recommendations were considered during the development process. The process was based on a systematic literature review, an independent external evaluation of the process and its results, and a prospective pilot study to evaluate the defined indicators in clinical practice.
   Results-Overall a set of 24 indicators was developed to measure performance of acute care hospitals in the 3 health care dimensions structure, process and outcome as well as in 3 treatment phases prehospital, in-hospital/acute and, postacute. Practicability of the derived indicators was tested in a prospective pilot study. During a 2-month period, 1006 patients in 13 hospitals were documented. Application of the new indicator set was found to be feasible by participating physicians and hospitals. Median time to document the required information for 1 patient was 5 minutes. Nationwide implementation of the new indicator set within regional registers in Germany started since April 2006.
   Conclusions-The development of indicators to measure hospital performance in stroke care is an important step toward improving stroke care on a national level. The chosen standardized evidence-based approach ensures maximal transparency, acceptance and sustainability of the developed indicators in Germany.

TI Land management strategy formulation in post-conflict societies
SO SURVEY REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB Developing a sustainable strategic action plan for land management and administration in post-conflict societies is extremely difficult. We will argue that it is not feasible to use conventional conceptual frameworks to underpin strategic action planning in post-conflict environments and, in fact, to do so might prove both inefficient and biased. This argument is based on work in Afghanistan, South Africa, Somalia, Mozambique, Uganda and Kosovo. Instead we argue that a soft systems approach, such as that developed by Barry and Fourie [4] in post-conflict South Africa, should ensure that the most appropriate activities are prioritised. By using examples based on cadastral systems and land administration, we show how a more appropriate strategic action plat? for land administration in post-conflict situations can be developed using this framework. This approach should improve both national reconciliation, as well as the efficiency of the land market.

AB The Industrial Revolution and associated economic, demographic, technological and cultural changes have resulted in what many scientists are beginning to refer to as "the Anthropocene" - roughly translated, the Age of Humans. One response to this development is the nascent field of "sustainability science," a multidisciplinary and systemic attempt to perceive and understand this new era. In doing so, however, methodologies and intellectual frameworks must be developed which extend beyond existing, dominantly reductionist, approaches, and are intended to address emergent characteristics of complex systems that integrate cultural and social systems, the engineered and built environment and natural systems. In the area of ethics, this requires developing a capability for "macroethics," or ethical systems and processes capable of addressing issues arising from the emergent behavior of the complicated systems that characterize the Anthropocene.

AB Given progress in policies for pursuing sustainable development, promoting commitment to thinking and acting more far-sightedly has become the primary strategic challenge. In the face of impatience, selfishness, uncertainty, analytical limitations, and vulnerability, strategies for promoting far-sightedness can be identified by assessing how these obstacles can be overcome. Strategies for creating or rescheduling tangible and deference rewards, realigning performance evaluations, implementing cognitive exercises, framing communications, altering decision-making processes, using self-restraint devices both to resist temptation and to enhance credibility, altering institutions to empower the patient, and stabilizing living conditions are the major categories for identifying and assessing the many strategies which arise out of both ordinary and constitutive policy initiatives.

TI Supporting climate change vulnerability and adaptation assessments in
   the Asia-Pacific region: an example of sustainability science
SO SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
DE Vulnerability; Adaptation; Risk; Sustainability; Asia; Pacific
ID IMPACT; RISK
AB Sustainability is achieved only when there is full reconciliation between: (1) economic development; (2) meeting, on an equitable basis, growing and changing human needs and aspirations; and (3) conserving the limited natural resources and the capacity of the environment to absorb the mulitple stresses that are a consequence of human activities. The linkages between climate and sustainability are examined in the context of both the wider Asia-Pacific region and local level climate risks and adaptation responses. These findings are used to underpin and illustrate several implications for sustainability science. Climate change is seen as both an impediment to increasing sustainability and as an opportunity, though in most cases the former far outweighs the latter. Assessments of climate change vulnerability and risk are shown to be of critical importance because they inform decisions as to where resources for adaptation are best invested. They also show whether global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions need to be strengthened because of limits to adaptation. In practice, adaptation takes place at many levels, essentially ranging between tangible interventions at community and enterprise level and national and international efforts to strengthen the enabling environment for adaptation. It is informative to undertake regional assessments of adaptation, even though most adaptation interventions need to reflect local conditions, including local adaptive capacities. The foregoing findings, based in part on a series of regional and local case studies, lead to several recommendations for further research that will help reduce barriers to implementing responses that reduce climate related risks, including adverse consequences for sustainability. The recommendations relate to such themes as making optimum use of predictive capabilities, characterising the linkages between climate change and sustainability, implications of the required rates and magnitudes of adaptation, institutional responses that enhance adaptive capacity, use of new and traditional technologies, the multiple dimensions of social responsibility, and enhancing the enabling environment for adaptation at the community and enterprise level. If these recommendations are acted upon they will, in turn, help address much needed improvements in quantifying the costs and benefits of adaptation, prioritising adaptation options, assessing sustainable development tradeoffs, and monitoring the success of adaptation initiatives. Such improvements will have even greater utility if they are incorporated into user-friendly decision support tools for adaptation.

AB While it is widely known that sustainable development is the only sound and viable pathway for humankind's future, its attainment remains elusive despite intensive efforts and some successes. The current industrial society approach based on product and process innovation in a variety of fields is not providing the expected results in addressing this important issue. In an attempt to carry out this unavoidable task, Osaka University's Research Institute for Sustainability Science (RISS) introduces an integral and dynamic innovation system where technology plays a key role in fulfilling societal functions. This innovation system adopts a highly solution-driven approach that makes use of backcasting techniques based on long-term visions and mid-term strategic goals. Since technology management is the key to propelling effective innovation towards sustainability, we propose a technology transition management through the interaction of technology push, demand pull and institutional design, along with eight transition principles. RISS will develop this innovation system based on these three components and through the design of dynamic scenarios and their roadmaps.

In this work a linear programming model was developed to simulate the effectiveness of different nitrogen runoff control policies, using Pinghu City in Tai Lake valley as an example. Four policy scenarios were tested: a tax at a rate equivalent to 50% of the cost of nitrogen fertilizer (S1); a ban on summer fertilizer applications to make the most use of fertilizer applied in the spring (S2); mandatory substitution of regular fertilizers by controlled-release fertilizers (S3); and a subsidy of US$300 ha(-1) (RMB phi 150 mu(-1)) for using compost (S4). The results indicate that all four policies would effectively reduce nitrogen runoff-by 9.8, 26.8, 14.4, and 80.0%, respectively. A subsidy for recycling domestic animal manure and utilizing compost had the most significant effect on the reduction of nitrogen runoff without reducing household income. This research suggests that measures to control agricultural NPS pollution should be combined with a policy to promote recycling of bio-resources and that financial support for NPS pollution control combined with bio-resource recycling should be regarded as one aspect of public investment in regional sustainable development.

AB Exchanges of carbon and nitrogen between the atmosphere and terrestrial ecosystems involve a complex set of interactions affected by both natural and management processes. Understanding these processes is important for managing ecosystem productivity and sustainability. Management processes also affect the net outcome of exchanges of greenhouse gases between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere. In developing a national carbon accounting system (NCAS) for Australia to account for emissions and removal of greenhouse gases to and from the atmosphere, a carbon: nitrogen mass balance ecosystem model (FullCAM) was developed. The FullCAM model is a hybrid of empirical and process modelling. The approach enables application to a wide range of natural resource management issues, because it is at land-management-relevant spatial and temporal resolution and captures the main process and management drivers. The scenario-prediction capability can be used to determine the emissions consequences of different management activities. Because, in Australia, emissions of greenhouse gases are closely related to the retention of dead organic matter and the availability of nitrogen for plant growth, the carbon and nitrogen cycling as modelled are good indicators of ecosystem productivity and condition. The NCAS also emphasizes the advantages of a comprehensive and integrated approach to developing a continental scale ecosystem-modelling system that has relevance both to estimation of greenhouse gas emissions and sustainable management of natural resources.

AB The East Asian economy has been growing fast in recent years, and environmental stresses are building up rapidly. Transboundary air pollution, water shortages, drinking water contamination, freshwater and marine pollution, deforestation, climatic disasters, and other environmental problems are becoming serious threats to the well-being of people in this densely populated region. The ESI (environmental sustainability index) reported by the World Economic Forum in 2005 is a good indicator of the environmental status of the region; most East Asian countries ranked at the bottom. East Asia is not moving toward a sustainable society, and the environment will not sustain the current rate of economic development for long. The traditional culture of East Asia used to be sustainable, so we can learn much from our traditions. Land use should be planned from an ecological point of view so as to best preserve the land's productivity and stability. There should be definite goals as to where and how much to preserve the three important ecological bases: forests, coastal wetlands and agricultural farms. The forest is the base for the terrestrial ecosystem, including flood control, water resources, and climate; the coastal wetland is the base for the marine ecosystem; farmland is the base for producing food. Within these defined goals, limits should be set on how much land can be utilized for activities like urban development, manufacturing, and recreation. Limits on the pollution load resulting from such activities should be set so as not to irreversibly damage the environment. Economic development should be planned to allow the use of energy and resources only after satisfying these constraints.

AB It has been clearly recognized that future global climate change will limit the possibilities for sustainable development in China. To minimize these negative effects, as a practical strategy, we suggest that the Chinese government engage in international cooperation as a key contributor in the prevention of global warming. This suggestion results from numerical estimations of China's greenhouse gas (GHG) emission trends accompanied with economic growth up to 2100. The results show that China's gross domestic product (GDP), measured in terms of purchasing power parity (PPP), may overtake the sum of the GDPs of the United States and Canada in 2020. It is predicted that GDP per capita may reach US$20,000 and $80,000 in 2050 and 2100, respectively; meanwhile, CO(2) emissions in China will increase from 6.6 billion tons (in carbon equivalent units) in 1990 to 54.6 billion tons in 2100. This means that the global peak concentration of GHG cannot be practically reduced without significant contributions from China. For international cooperation in mitigating global climate change, we introduce a new option, "per-capita emission restricted by assigned amount," as an accounting rule for GHG reduction. This baseline classifies global CO(2) reduction actions into three categories: compulsory reduction, self-imposed reduction, and voluntary reduction. We suggest that China contribute to world CO(2) reduction according to the following timetable: voluntary reduction until 2012, self-imposed reduction until 2020, and compulsory reduction from 2020. The simulation results also indicate that China can benefit from this strategy in terms of improvements in its domestic economy and environment, for instance, by reducing fossil fuel consumption and the emission of pollutants.

AB Global energy demand is expected to increase from the current 400 ExaJ per year to as much as 700-1,000 ExaJ per year by the middle of this century. If fossil carbon resources continue to make up the bulk of the energy supply, not only will atmospheric carbon dioxide increase to levels not seen for the past 30-35 million years, but depleting fossil carbon resources will become increasingly less available for other purposes, particularly the production of chemicals on which society now depends. The chemical process industries are heavily dependent on the availability of low-price petroleum as a feedstock. Recent life-cycle analyses suggest that pursuing both strategies of renewable energy sources and renewable feedstocks (i.e. biomass) will be required to meet these competing demands. Reducing the global use of both energy and manufactured chemicals will be a challenge for sustainable development. Education of the next generation of chemists and chemical engineers will have to change significantly from its current emphasis on petrochemical-based manufacturing to include a much greater emphasis on renewable resources and biobased processes.

AB A dominant objective within the public policies of all SE Asian countries has been the achievement of economic growth. The issue of sustainability has serious implications for this policy objective. Pursuit of economic growth is concerned solely with the present, whilst sustainability is concerned with ensuring the current generation meets its present needs without threatening future generations' ability to do likewise. National accounts, such as gross domestic product, can measure healthy economies, but they can not measure sustainability. This paper, however, sets out a conceptual approach that describes the misalignment of national accounting measures with sustainability objectives and provides empirical evidence of how this misalignment can be partially overcome. An empirical approach is developed whereby certain adjustments to national accounts, based on normative social choice theory, are introduced to indicate how a partial measure of sustainability can be determined using national accounting aggregates as a base.

AB Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan implemented Hayek's market economics by manipulating macro-structural forces. It is argued here that the culture of sustainable development appears to be disseminating in the opposite way: it is gradually permeating through from concentrated pockets of practices to its surrounding communities. The difference in diffusion patterns should be reflected in proposed formulations of emancipatory accounting frameworks: emancipatory accounting should allow for moral development of the individual (by caring for the needs of the other). It becomes another vehicle for engaging in stakeholder dialogue about the meaning and implications of sustainable development. The defining characteristics of this emancipatory accounting framework are as follows: its definition of sustainability should transcend the narrow interpretation of individual property rights (that restricts responsibility for the other); it should engender moral development because of ambiguity over terminology; it should socialize the process of risk management as an integral part of balancing resource and economic sustainability.

TI The challenge of greening global product chains: Meeting both ends
SO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article

   sustainable production
ID MANAGEMENT
AB Greening of product chains has come up as an important means to systematically improve the environmental performance of products from cradle to cradle in Europe and elsewhere. Some experience with inter-firm co-operation aiming at reducing the environmental impacts has been generated in recent years. Most of these experiences involve cooperation between some of the links in product chains, very often stopping at European borders. Problems of market communication, information availability and information costs prevent companies from going beyond these lines. Also, anonymous markets may prevent communication between producers and end-users in the West and supplying firms in developing countries. Only very few documented case studies of global greening of product chains are available. Therefore, the challenge here is how to establish interactions with the first links in supply chains. Within the context of South Africa it is of cardinal importance to identify these links to ensure sustainable synergy. European countries are constantly changing the standards of products in order to meet environmental targets. Moreover, European consumer markets are increasingly sensitive to environmentally sound products. From the perspective of South African suppliers there is an increasing need for interaction in their global product chains. In this conceptual analysis we will present the way that should be followed from both ends of the global product chains. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

TI Reducing waste: Repair, recondition, remanufacture or recycle?
SO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE waste; remanufacturing; sustainable design
AB Between 1980 and 1997, municipal waste in OECD countries increased by around 40%. This paper outlines the very real negative effects of this increase and then introduces the two main European Union policies that have been established to address this problem: a landfill directive and legislation on extended producer responsibility (E P R).
   The paper then describes and compares the four alternative strategies to reducing end-of-life waste within the context of extended producer responsibility: namely repairing, reconditioning, remanufacturing or recycling. It also introduces a more robust definition of remanufacturing, validated by earlier research, which differentiates it from repair and reconditioning.
   From a consideration of the different factors involved, it concludes that remanufacturing may well be the best strategy. This is because it enables the embodied energy of virgin production to be maintained, preserves the intrinsic 'added value' of the product for the manufacturer and enables the resultant products to be sold 'as new' with updated features if necessary.

LA English
DT Article
DE sustainability; social construction; drinking water companies; strategy;
   ethnographic interviewing; grounded theory
AB The concept of sustainable development means different things to different people in different contexts, leading to 'strong' and 'weak' versions of sustainability. This article addresses the question of which meaning of sustainability is given by the Dutch drinking water sector and its main stakeholders. The 'weak', or human-oriented, school was found at three of the four water companies studied. This is understandable, because water companies have a human-oriented task: to provide the public with drinking water. The 'strong' version of sustainability was found within several governmental bodies. Their view of 'staying within the natural water system' was unacceptable for most other societal actors. A third form of sustainability was developed by the fourth drinking water company studied. It bridges the human and nature interests in a step by step dialogue. This way of looking at sustainable development may be an interesting perspective in which humans start seeing themselves as an integral part of nature again, instead of as being outside and above nature..

TI A data envelopment analysis approach to the assessment of natural parks'
   economic efficiency and sustainability. The case of Italian national
   parks
SO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE data envelopment analysis; natural park management
ID DEA
AB Wilderness protection is a growing necessity for modern societies, and this is particularly true for areas where population density is extremely high, for example Europe. Conservation, however, implies very high opportunity costs. It is thus crucial to create incentives for efficient management practices, to promote benchmarking and to improve conservation management. In the present paper we propose a methodology based on data envelopment analysis, DEA, a non-parametric benchmarking technique specifically developed to assess the relative efficiency of decision-making units. In particular, the objective of the discussed methodology is to assess the relative efficiency of the management units of the protected area and to indicate how it could be improved, by providing a set of guidelines. The main advantage of this methodology is that it allows us to assess the efficiency of natural park management not only internally (comparing the performance of the park with itself over time) but also by external benchmarking, thus providing new and different perspectives on potential improvements. Although the proposed methodology is fairly general, we have applied it to the context of Italian national parks in order to produce a representative case study. Specifically, the choice of adequate cost and benefit indicators is a very important and delicate phase of any benchmark analysis. For this purpose, a questionnaire was used to investigate the opinions of Italian national park managers and stakeholders and to define the relevant indicators for the analysis. Finally, relevant policy implications for the case study are given. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

AB Contemporary approaches to ethics are centred upon utilitarian and formal ethics. Yet, these are not capable of counteracting the moral crisis in our society. We must move beyond self-interest or merely doing what is specified in codes, to Samaritan ethics, which means attending to the needs of our neighbour even when he is unable to repay us. This ethic has systemic properties; therefore, it can be incorporated into an appropriate systems science framework that includes the humanities and the historical mode of reasoning. Furthermore, rather than social, economic and political manipulation, education-in the classical humanist tradition-should be the appropriate method to help implement such ethics into our societies.

AB This paper measures two descriptors of tourism-namely, its scale and agglomeration level-and subsequently evaluates both descriptors according to their direct and joint impacts on the host communities' quality of life. The key constructs for this research are the following: (1) a tourism evaluation function that incorporates the scale and agglomeration of tourism, which is constructed for each one of the 50 Spanish provinces; and (2) a measure of the host communities' quality of life that comprises 12 objective partial indicators and an overall indicator that integrates them all. Results show the existence of carrying capacity frontiers or maximum thresholds that tourist destinations can sustain without damaging the economic, socio-cultural, or environmental systems of the communities they belong.

AB In the tourism market, it is destinations that compete, not individual firms [Ritchie, J. R. B., & Crouch, G. I. (2000). The competitive destination: A sustainable perspective. Tourism Management, 21(SI), 1-7]. Growing competition, both national and international, is making this more and more apparent. In fact, every destination (defined here as tourist district) has to position its products in such a way that gives them character and personality. The traditional fragmented structure of the European market has spurred the development of metamanagement organizations called destination management organizations (DMOs). Today, DMOs are called on to play a critical role: to help local firms build sustainable competitive advantage and to create competitive advantage for the entire district through positioning choices.
   This paper proposes a dynamic model of destination management (DDMM) which identifies typical metamanagement processes a DMO can use to shape district strategy. The usefulness of this work can be seen not only in the need to formulate a "good strategy", which is often described in terms of positioning or criticality (strategy content), but also a method or a path that enables firms to build that positioning or acquire that criticality (strategy process). In fact, Kaplan and Norton [(2001). The strategy focused organization. How balanced scorecard companies thrive in the new business environment. HBS Press] note that the ability to implement a strategy is more important than the quality of the strategy itself.
   The model proposed here, consistent with the empirical evidence gathered in multiple longitudinal case studies, underscores the criticality of two different types of metamanagement processes: (i) a series of operative activies, here defined as primary processes, which can shape the resources of the district and serve to create, supply, and communicate local product systems, and (ii) a series of support processes, which can provide the "glue" between various players (public and private, profit and non-profit, entrepreneurs and community) that operate within the district.
   If these processes are effectively managed, they have a significant impact on the competitive advantage of the firms operating in the tourist district. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Indian hematite ores are typically rich in iron but contain unusually high alumina (as high as seven percent) and in some cases, problem of high phosphorous content is also noted. The current practice of iron ore washing in India results in three products, namely coarse ore lumps, directly charged to blast furnace, the classifier fines, (3-5% alumina) which with or without beneficiation are fed to sintering plants and the slimes (6-10% alumina) discarded as waste. The present practice of discarding slimes is not at all sustainable, considering the acute shortage of land and water on the one hand and the increasing proportion of slimes likely to be generated as a consequence of the urgent necessity of producing lower alumina burdens for the blast furnace on the other. An integrated approach of processing Indian iron ore slimes is presented in this communication. It consists of an appropriate beneficiation strategy (including selective flocculation-dispersion, flotation), a downstream pelletization / sintering / briquetting process to prepare a product acceptable to blast furnace and a cost effective, eco-friendly semi-dry technology of tailings management (substituting tailings ponds) and/or production of value-added products from the iron rich alumino-silicate residue. Development of selective reagents capable of accomplishing hematite-alumina/gibbsite separation has been identified as a key research challenge in this context.

AB Holiday travel behavior, individual characteristics of holiday travelers and strategies to change holiday travel behavior are the subjects of this article. From the environmental perspective, the journey to the destinations is the most critical aspect of traveling. Based on a 2003 survey of 1991 German inhabitants, the kilometers traveled and the choice of transportation mode for holiday purposes have been quantified. According to the number of trips and kilometers traveled, four travel groups have been identified. The groups vary according to socio-demographics, psychological factors, number of holiday trips, and travel mode choice. Persons who traveled to more distant destinations also traveled more often and used air travel for more than 60% of their trips. For the other groups, car travel was more important. Correlating the four travel groups with greenhouse gas emissions reveals that the smallest group-the long-haul travelers-was responsible for 80% of the emissions of the whole sample. Income, education, and openness to change were main indicators of individual greenhouse gas emissions. Target group oriented strategies to reduce the environmental impact of holiday mobility are discussed against the background of 84 in-depth interviews conducted with selected representatives of the first survey.

TI The impact of "free" public transport: The case of Brussels
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE
LA English

AB Public transport subsidies play an important role in the present Belgian mobility policy. The introduction of "free" bus transport in Hasselt in 1997 was an important event. Later, the Flemish government in cooperation with the regional public transport company elaborated the so-called "third-payer system" for target groups. The price of public transport is not paid by the user or the provider, but partly or completely by a "third party". In how far these measures contribute to a more sustainable mobility system has caused much debate.
   In the academic year 2003-2004, a "free public transport" initiative was introduced for the students of Flemish colleges and universities in Brussels. These students had the opportunity to obtain a refunded annual season ticket on Brussels public transport. Brussels was selected for the case study, because in the same city there is a group of students that benefits from the measure, and another group (students from French speaking universities and colleges) that does not. In order to examine the effects of this measure, we conducted a survey among the students to examine their present travel behaviour (number of trips, motives, modal choice...) and the changes with the travel behaviour of the previous year. In addition we compare the current travel behaviour between the students benefiting from the measure, and those who do not. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Extended excess commuting: A measure of the jobs-housing imbalance in
   Seoul
SO URBAN STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
ID WASTEFUL; BALANCE
AB The balance between jobs and housing has received considerable attention in the recent debates over sustainable urban development. The excess commuting technique, which measures the difference between the average observed commute and the average minimum commute, has been suggested as one means to identify the numerical imbalance between workplaces and residential locations. This paper extends the conventional approach through the development of an extended excess commuting technique, which can measure both the quantitative and qualitative imbalance. The empirical results show that commuters in the Seoul Metropolitan Area (SMA) have tried to reduce both qualitative and quantitative imbalance based on time rather than distance over the past 10 years (1990-2000). The results show how the spatial processes of decentralisation have been countered by the economic processes of faster travel, and how the net result is a saving in the journey to work travel time.

AB Integrated watershed management is required to ensure the reasonable use of resources and reconcile interactions among natural and human systems. In the present study, an interval fuzzy multiobjective programming (IFMOP) method was used to solve an integrated watershed management problem. Based on system analysis, an IFMOP model suitable for a lake watershed system {IFMOPLWS} was developed and applied to the Lake Qionghai watershed in China. Scenario analysis and an interactive approach were used in the solution process. In this manner, various system components were incorporated into one framework for holistic consideration and optimization. Integrality and uncertainty, as well as the multiobjective and dynamic characteristics of the watershed system, were well addressed. Using two scenarios, two planning schemes were generated. Agriculture, tourism, macroeconomics, cropland use, water supply, forest coverage, soil erosion, and water pollution were fully interpreted and compared to identify a preferable planning alternative for local agencies. This study showed that the IFMOPLWS is a powerful tool for integrated watershed management planning and can provide a solid base for sustainable watershed management.

AB The purpose of this paper is to review the case for using 'capture' rather than recharge as the conceptual basis for sustainable groundwater use in South Africa. Capture refers to the sum of the increase in recharge and decrease in discharge brought about by pumping. Definitions of sustainability are reviewed, and the capture process is outlined. Implications for using the capture principle in the implementation of the NWA are discussed, and adaptive management is proposed as an appropriate management approach. Implications for groundwater monitoring are also discussed. Case studies are described that support the need for adaptive management and the application of the capture principle.

AB Activities and developments in the coastal zone, and in adjacent catchments, pose an increasing threat to the sustainability of the natural and socio-economic goods and services supplied by marine ecosystems. Governing authorities have had to develop new policies to promote environmentally responsible and sustainable development practices, either through legislation and/or incentive mechanisms. These, in turn, created the need for holistic and integrated frameworks within which to design and implement environmental management programmes.
   A structured ecosystem-scale approach for the design and implementation of marine water quality management programmes developed by the CSIR (South Africa) in response to recent advances in policies and legislation pertaining to sustainable utilisation of Southern Africa's marine environment is discussed. The framework provides an integrated scientific base within which to set, for example, wastewater emission targets, taking into account ecosystem process complexity. It also aims to support and stimulate local stakeholder empowerment and involvement.

AB Is the conflict between biodiversity conservation and poverty reduction, which frequently arises in park creation programs, insoluble? The authors report empirical evidence from 12 case studies from six countries, which are analyzed through the conceptual lens of the Impoverishment Risks and Reconstruction Model for Involuntary Resettlement. The research concludes conservatively that parks in the Congo basin have already displaced and impoverished about 120-150,000 people and that more will be displaced if this approach continues, despite its deleterious outcomes. The authors argue that the park-establishment strategy predicated upon compulsory population displacement has exhausted its credibility and compromised the cause of biodiversity conservation by inflicting aggravated impoverishment on very large numbers of people. They recommend that the concerned Governments should desist using the eviction approach. The alternative course, proposed by the authors, is to replace forced displacements with a pro-poor strategy that pursues "double sustainability," to protect both the biodiversity and people's livelihoods at the same time.

AB This paper gives an updated outlook on geriatric health care in Germany and on research demands with particular respect to advanced-age patients with multimorbidity. The paper is written from the perspective of health services research and addresses selected topics such as primary care, palliative care, health policies and patient orientation. It is pointed out that the structure of services and processes of health care delivery is not compatible with the complex demands of the target group, and that the priorities of improvement strategies may differ among the various professional groups involved (e.g. primary chare physicians as generalists and palliative and geriatric experts as specialists). Furthermore, it is argued that the current incentives for establishing integrated health care may not be adequate to ensure that sustainable changes are made in the long term.

AB A rehabilitation care management oriented towards the severity of the disease, the individual competence and the patient's needs essentially improves the effectivity and the sustainability of inpatient rehabilitation. The Institute of Gerontology of the University of Heidelberg is developing an assessment for elderly stroke patients to optimize placement decision by an early rehabilitation prognosis. Data concerning functional, cognitive and psychological status were collected in 267 patients participating in a postacute rehabilitation program on admission, after two weeks and on discharge and six weeks later. In this article are presented the study design and patients' characteristics during the rehabilitation process. The first assessment at admission gives important information about the sustainability of the ADL-competence after discharge. Severe stroke, premorbid ADLcompetence, cognitive impairment, communication problems, depression and higher age were found to be predictors for the outcome of the rehabilitation process.

AB The strategic principles that enable simple, open-structure solid catalysts to be systematically designed so as to oxidize selectively a wide range of organic compounds in air or oxygen under mild conditions, and often without use of solvent are outlined. Illustrated examples of specific reactions, that utilize single-site catalysts that permit these conversions, include: preferential conversion of cyclohexane to adipic acid, toluene to either benzaldehyde or benzoic acid, linear alkanes to terminally oxyfunctionalized products, alkenes to epoxides, ketones to lactones, methanol to formaldehyde and ammonia to hydroxylamine, the last reaction under in situ conditions. Single-site catalysts open up methods for the future avoidance of ecologically harmful procedures, which are still publicized in modem textbooks, that use aggressive stoichiometric oxidants such as CrO3/H2SO4, pyridinium chlorochromate, SeO2, KMnO4 and KHSO5.

The 2006 symposium provides a synthesis of research concerned with human impacts on fluvial systems - including hydrologic and geomorphic changes to watersheds - while also commemorating the 50th anniversary of the 1955 Man's Role in Changing the Face of the Earth Symposium [Thomas, Jr., W. L. (Ed.), 1956a. Man's Role in Changing the Face of the Earth. Univ. Chicago Press, Chicago. 1193 pp]. This paper examines the 1955 symposium from the perspective of human impacts on rivers, reviews current inquiry on anthropogenic interactions in fluvial systems, and anticipates future directions in this field.
   Although the 1955 symposium did not have an explicit geomorphic focus, it set the stage for many subsequent anthropogeomorphic studies. The 1955 conference provided guidance to geomorphologists by recommending and practicing interdisciplinary scholarship, through the use of diverse methodologies applied at extensive temporal and geographical scales, and through its insistence on an integrated understanding of human interactions with nature. Since 1956, research on human impacts to fluvial systems has been influenced by fundamental changes in why the research is done, what is studied, how river studies are conducted, and who does the research. Rationales for river research are now driven to a greater degree by institutional needs, environmental regulations, and aquatic restoration. New techniques include a host of dating, spatial imaging, and ground measurement methods that can be coupled with analytical functions and digital models. These new methods have led to a greater understanding of channel change, variations across multiple temporal and spatial scales, and integrated watershed perspectives; all changes that are reflected by the papers in this volume. These new methods also bring a set of technical demands for the training of geomorphologists. The 2006 Binghamton Geomorphology Symposium complements the 1956 symposium by providing a more specific and updated view of river systems coupled with human interactions. The symposium focuses on linkages between human land use, structures, and channel modification with geomorphology, hydrology, and ecology. The emergence of sustainability as a central policy guideline in environmental management should generate greater interest in geomorphic perspectives, especially as they pertain to human activities. The lack of theories of anthropogeomorphic change, however, presents a challenge for the next generation of geomorphologists in this rapidly growing subfield. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB As the result of current and historical metal mining, river channels and floodplains in many parts of the world have become contaminated by metal-rich waste in concentrations that may pose a hazard to human livelihoods and sustainable development. Environmental and human health impacts commonly arise because of the prolonged residence time of heavy metals in river sediments and alluvial soils and their bioaccumulatory nature in plants and animals. This paper considers how an understanding of the processes of sediment-associated metal dispersion in rivers, and the space and timescales over which they operate, can be used in a practical way to help river basin managers more effectively control and remediate catchments affected by current and historical metal mining. A geomorphological approach to the management of rivers contaminated by metals is outlined and four emerging research themes are highlighted and critically reviewed. These are: (1) response and recovery of river systems following the failures of major tailings dams; (2) effects of flooding on river contamination and the sustainable use of floodplains; (3) new developments in isotopic fingerprinting, remote sensing and numerical modelling for identifying the sources of contaminant metals and for mapping the spatial distribution of contaminants in river channels and floodplains; and (4) current approaches to the remediation of river basins affected by mining, appraised in light of the European Union's Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC). Future opportunities for geomorphologically-based assessments of mining-affected catchments are also identified. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Technological citizenship: Perspectives in the recent work of Manuel
   Castells and Paul Virilio
SO SOCIOLOGICAL RESEARCH ONLINE
LA English
DT Article
DE citizenship; technology; network; politics; exclusion; cosmopolitanism
AB This article draws out the different models of technological citizenship that are available in the writing of Castells and Virilio. Particular attention is paid to the importance of local ecological struggles against the imperatives of technological capitalism. However both Castells and Virilio contain strengths and weaknesses in this respect. Whereas Castells emphasises the contested nature of modernity, Virilio emphasis the dominance of technological reason over the life-world. Further both agree that the defence of local space has a key role to play in the construction of alternative citizenships. In contrast I argue that there can be no local solutions to global problems. Here I look at a number of cosmopolitan perspectives and argue that the claims of justice, sustainability and democracy requires new global institutions. However the blind spot in the cosmopolitan argument remains a top down approach to politics and imperviousness as to how to link radical politics to the contours of everyday life.

AB L. vannamei postlarvae are normally raised with a protein dense diet (50% protein) rich in fishmeal. Part of the protein is utilized for energy purpose instead of protein synthesis. Based on a previous energy partitioning study, the effects of two isoenergetic compounded feed treatments - animal protein (AP) and vegetable protein and carbohydrates (VPC) - upon growth efficiency and energy budget of shrimp postlarvae and early juveniles were determined. Recovered energy (RE) or production (P) after 50 days trial was similar (2 J day(-1)) in both treatments, from PL14 to PL19. However, early juveniles discriminated between animal protein (116 J day(-1)) and vegetable protein and carbohydrates (88 J day(-1)). The difference in respiration indicated a higher heat increment with AP compared to VPC. At maintenance level, energy used was lower with AP than VPC treatment. Post-larvae and early juveniles employed protein as a main energy substrate (O:N < 20). Differences in the efficiencies observed in the calculated energy budget were attributed to the presence of carbohydrates in diet and not to the protein source. The advantage of incorporating vegetable protein source in the diet of harvesting shrimp may eventually contribute towards a reduction of fishmeal costs and waste products as well as to achieve sustainable shrimp farming.

TI The ecologically ideal road density for small islands: The case of
   Kinmen
SO ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
DE road density; island biogeography; small islands; Kinmen
ID WOLF; POPULATIONS; AREA
AB Road construction is one of the most destructive developments on small islands. Road networks can lead to fragmentation of habitats or may cause sudden extinctions of native species, hence it is important to study the influence of road systems on a small island's ecosystem. Using the Kinmen islands, Taiwan, as an example, this research intends to obtain the acceptable road density for small islands, from an ecological point of view. Three methods of deriving the acceptable road density for small islands are developed in this analysis. The first method incorporates the allowable density of roads for viably sustainable populations of wolves in continental areas. Since wolves are the top predators of a healthy ecosystem and because with a sustainable wolf population the ecosystem is believed to be sound, this road density could be ideal for a small island. However, the allowable road density for wolves was obtained in continental areas and it is not clear that it is valid, in direct application, on small islands. The second method modifies the road density from model islands to fit the conditions of the desired islands. In this research, Okinawa (Japan) is the model island and used as a suitable density of roads for Kinmen. Finally, in the third method, the largest small island was used as the model island and derivation procedure of the second method was applied.
   Results show that the smaller islands have a higher density of species but a lower ideal road density. Also, the current road density of Kinmen has exceeded the results obtained by the three models. Therefore, road construction policies must be rigorously reviewed for the sake of Kinmen's ecosystem.

AB Background: Islet transplantation offers the potential to improve glycemic control in a subgroup of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus who are disabled by refractory hypoglycemia. We conducted an international, multicenter trial to explore the feasibility and reproducibility of islet transplantation with the use of a single common protocol (the Edmonton protocol).
   Methods: We enrolled 36 subjects with type 1 diabetes mellitus, who underwent islet transplantation at nine international sites. Islets were prepared from pancreases of deceased donors and were transplanted within 2 hours after purification, without culture. The primary end point was defined as insulin independence with adequate glycemic control 1 year after the final transplantation.
   Results: Of the 36 subjects, 16 (44%) met the primary end point, 10 (28%) had partial function, and 10 (28%) had complete graft loss 1 year after the final transplantation. A total of 21 subjects (58%) attained insulin independence with good glycemic control at any point throughout the trial. Of these subjects, 16 (76%) required insulin again at 2 years; 5 of the 16 subjects who reached the primary end point (31%) remained insulin-independent at 2 years.
   Conclusions: Islet transplantation with the use of the Edmonton protocol can successfully restore long-term endogenous insulin production and glycemic stability in subjects with type 1 diabetes mellitus and unstable control, but insulin independence is usually not sustainable. Persistent islet function even without insulin independence provides both protection from severe hypoglycemia and improved levels of glycated hemoglobin. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00014911.)

AB Fuel control is one of the most pressing topics to achieve a self-sustainable direct liquid-feed fuel cell system, such as a direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC), and enhance its overall efficiency. In a DMFC system, sensing the methanol concentration generally serves as the basis of the fuel control strategies. This paper proposes a three-dimensional measurement space and constant concentration surfaces (CCS) to develop an algorithm of estimating fuel concentration in a liquid-feed system, which embraces the following merits: (1) it measures only three quantities or indices that correlate with the fuel concentration. The indices can be chosen as current, voltage, temperature, or other quantities that are easily acquired in an operating fuel cell system. The estimation can be accomplished without interrupting the operation of the system, (2) it estimates the fuel concentration in a three-dimensional measurement space; hence it is suitable for situations when one or more operating conditions are varying, (3) it can be performed as a sensor-less approach that requires no additional methanol sensors, thus consuming the less system power, and (4) it is particularly suitable for small and hand-held applications.

AB The lack of sustainability of the current Spanish energy system makes it necessary to study the adoption of alternative energy models. One of these is what is known as the hydrogen economy. In this paper, we aim to plan, for the case of Spain, an initial phase for transition to this energy model making use of the potential offered by each Spanish region. Specifically, the target pursued is to satisfy at least 15% of energy demand for transport by 2010 through renewable sources. We plan to attain this target gradually, establishing intermediate stages consisting of supplying 5 and 10% of the energy demand for transport by 2006 and 2008, respectively. The results obtained allow us to determine, for each region, the hydrogen production and consumption, the renewable energy sources used to obtain hydrogen and the transport requirements between regions.

AB Previously, we reported that an ordinarily non-lethal dose of thioacetamide (TA, 300 mg/kg) causes 90% mortality in type I diabetic rats due to inhibited liver tissue repair, whereas 30 mg TA/kg allows 100% survival due to stimulated although delayed tissue repair. Objective of this investigation was to test whether prior administration of a low dose of TA (30 mg/kg) would lead to sustainable stimulation of liver tissue repair in type I diabetic rats sufficient to protect from a subsequently administered lethal dose of TA. Therefore, in the present study, the hypothesis that preplacement of tissue repair by a low dose of TA (30 mg TA/kg, ip) can reverse the hepatotoxicant sensitivity (autoprotection) in type I diabetic rats was tested.
   Preliminary studies revealed that a single intraperitoneal (ip) administration of TA causes 90% mortality in diabetic rats with as low as 75 mg/kg. To establish an autoprotection model in diabetic condition, diabetic rats were treated with 30 mg TA/kg (priming dose). Administration of priming dose stimulated tissue repair that peaked at 72 h, at which time these rats were treated with a single ip dose of 75 mg TA/kg. Our results show that tissue repair stimulated by the priming dose enabled diabetic rats to overexpress, calpastatin, endogenous inhibitor of calpain, to inhibit calpain-mediated progression of liver injury induced by the subsequent administration of lethal dose, resulting in 100% survival. Further investigation revealed that protection observed in these rats is not due to decreased bioactivation. These studies underscore the importance of stimulation of tissue repair in the final outcome of liver injury (survival/death) after hepatotoxicant challenge. Furthermore, these results also suggest that it is possible to stimulate tissue repair in diabetics to overcome the enhanced sensitivity of hepatotoxicants. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB In search of viable ways to create more sustainable diets, it is extremely valuable to analyse how people in various countries are supplied with dietary proteins from plant-based and animal-based sources. As a cross-national comparison of food ingredients may easily lead to misleading interpretations, it is crucial to opt for a multidisciplinary approach and to focus on countries that are spread across a bounded geographical area. In the present paper, an overview of diet proteins in the EU-15 member states is presented. As it turns out, the diets are rather diverse but everywhere the same major sources can be distinguished, i.e., meat, cereals and milk. The analysis showed a strong influence of location on protein diets. There are significant differences between, on the one hand, countries with high supplies of protein provided by vegetables and cereals, and, on the other hand, countries with high supplies of protein derived from milk. in this respect, Portugal, Italy and Greece can be contrasted with The Netherlands, Sweden and Finland as the two poles of an axis, with intermediate positions for the other countries. A number of interrelated differences between these countries clearly demonstrated the impacts of ecological, economic and cultural factors on current dietary protein supply. Although it does not make sense to plea simply in favour of turning the clock back, we draw the conclusion that there is room for a diet that is less dependent on meat proteins without going beyond the limits set by nutrition and health. Our results suggest that the East Mediterranean diet of the early 1960s has interesting qualities for the development of options to create more sustainable, healthful diets. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

DT Article
DE biodiversity features and functions; polycentric governance;
   institutions; economic efficiency; complexity
AB The core question this paper attempts to address is how social organization needs to respond to biodiversity features and functions in order to achieve its sustainable use. Scholars have suggested that the governance of complex systems should be dispersed across multiple centers of authority and that any regulative system needs as much variety in the actions that it can take as exists in the system it is regulating. Further, it has been argued that complex ecosystems and biodiversity can successfully be maintained by complex, polycentric multi-layered governance systems which have a variet of response mechanisms. But how should polycentric governance of biodiversity be organized? Borrowing from the organization of public economies in metropolitan areas we distinguish between production and provision of public ecosystem services and suggest the direction of institutional change for the organization of a public ecosystem service economy. If the market alone cannot solve the allocation of public ecosystem services, economic efficiency criteria based on hypothetical markets are not sufficient. Therefore, we suggest design principles which go beyond economic efficiency and provide examples of the emergence of polycentric governance from an Ethiopian coffee forest conservation project.

AB Neurotrophic factor delivery to sites of spinal cord injury (SCI) promotes axon growth into but not beyond lesion sites. We tested the hypothesis that sustained growth factor gradients beyond regions of SCI will promote significant axonal bridging into and beyond lesions. Adult rats underwent C3 lesions to transect ascending dorsal column sensory axons, and autologous bone marrow stromal cells were grafted into the lesion to provide a cellular bridge for growth into the injured region. Concurrently, lentiviral vectors expressing neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) or green fluorescent protein (GFP) ( controls) were injected into the host cord rostral to the lesion to promote axon extension beyond the graft/lesion. Four weeks later, NT-3 gradients beyond the lesion were detectable by ELISA in animals that received NT-3-expressing lentiviral vectors, with highest average NT-3 levels located near the rostral vector injection site. Significantly more ascending sensory axons extended into tissue rostral to the lesion site in animals injected with NT-3 vectors compared with GFP vectors, but only if the zone of NT-3 vector transduction extended continuously from the injection site to the graft; any "gap" in NT-3 expression from the graft to rostral tissue resulted in axon bridging failure. Despite axon bridging beyond the lesion, regenerating axons did not continue to grow over very long distances, even in the presence of a continuing growth factor gradient beyond the lesion. These findings indicate that a localized and continuous gradient of NT-3 can achieve axonal bridging beyond the glial scar, but growth for longer distances is not sustainable simply with a trophic stimulus.

AB Because of the high income resulting from apple production, apple orchards have widely spread since the 1980's in the gully region of Loess Plateau of China. Compared to winter wheat, a major crop in this region, apple trees deplete most of the available water in the 010 in soil profile after 30 years, resulting in a decline of apple yield and profitability. Apple trees older than 30 years are often cut, and orchards reconverted to winter wheat, but wheat planted after apple trees suffers from low yield, and groundwater from low recharge rate due to reduced soil water content. The objective of this study was to determine, with the one-dimensional simulation model Simultaneous Heat and Water Transfer (SHAW), the time required for soil water to recover after apple tree cutting. Recovery time is defined as the amount of time required for a field just cut of its apple trees to recover to the same soil water content of a field that has always been cropped to wheat. SHAW soil and crop parameters were calibrated (1984-1989) and validated (1989-1994) using measured soil water contents in bare soil and winter wheat plots. Using calibrated soil and crop parameters, soil water content variations in the 0-10 in soil profile was simulated under winter wheat conditions for forty randomly generated climatic sequences based on observed 48-year historical data (1957-2004). Results show that the recovery time varies from 6.S to 19.S years, with an average of 13.7 years, for the 0-10 in soil profile, and from 4.4 to 8.4 years, with an average of 7.3 years, for upper 0-3 in soil profile. Due to lower soil water content, the mean groundwater recharge rate would be 9.3 mm year(-1) in orchard cut plots during the recovery period, compared to 18.3 mm year(-1) for land that had always been in winter wheat. Considering the long-term effects of apple orchards on land productivity and groundwater recharge, areas in apple orchards should be restricted to maintain sustainable agriculture in this region.

AB Agricultural production along the Lower Arkansas River of Colorado is being negatively affected as a result of irrigation induced waterlogging and soil salinization. This publication presents an estimate of these damages along a study area of approximately 65,000 irrigated acres for 3 different years. Estimates of the damage are generated by linking a detailed hydrologic model, calibrated from extensive field data, to an economic model that evaluates productivity losses within the study region. The hydrologic model provides a detailed estimate of the soil salinity levels and water table depths that occur throughout the region. Using geographic information system (GIS) software, the output from the hydrologic model is converted into field level data which are used to estimate the damages that are occurring upon each irrigated field across the study area. Previously published research that identifies the relationship between crop yield and soil salinization was used to estimate the impact of soil salinity on agricultural production. The relationship between crop yield and waterlogging was estimated econometrically using a synthesis of secondary data sources. The results indicate that the impact of waterlogging and soil salinization within this region is significant. Average annual losses to agricultural production along the study area were estimated to be approximately US$ 68/acre or US$ 4.3 million. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All tights reserved.

AB The resource-based view of the enterprises generally attributes superior financial performance to organizational resources and capabilities. Firm-specific IT resources are classified as IT infrastructure, human-IT resources, and IT-enabled intangibles. This paper empirically examines the association between IT investment and firm performance. Results indicate that firms with high levels of IT infrastructure and human-IT resources have a strong positive relationship with IT-enabled intangibles, but not with firm performance. In addition, IT-enabled intangibles are strongly positively correlated with firm performance. The relationships between IT investment and corporate IT capability are also examined. The results suggest that IT investments have begun to show results, indicating that they can make a positive contribution to firm IT infrastructure. However, the various measures of IT investment do not appear to have a positive relationship with human-IT resources, and IT-enabled intangibles. Although IT investment is likely to improve organizational IT infrastructure, but the IT-enabled intangibles is the key factor to effect the business performance, and the human-IT resource is a driving force for the IT-enabled intangibles.

AB The resource consumption of the Chinese society from 1981 to 2001 is investigated using ecological footprint (EF) and emergetic ecological footprint (EEF). The latter is a newly development modification of ecological footprint based on ecological thermodynamics. Individual sectors in society are described in detail corresponding to the EF and EEF components based on different views of ecological production. The EF and EEF intensities are also presented to depict the resource consumption level corresponding to unit economic output. Finally, EEF is suggested to serve as a modified indicator of EF to illustrate the resource, environment, and population activity, and thereby reflecting the ecological overshoot of the general ecological system.

AB Matsutake (Tricholoma spp.) are a group of commercially important mushrooms that are increasingly threatened by over-collection. Ecologically sustainable management of matsutake has been hindered by the lack of essential information such as reliable distribution maps. Although a variety of spatial distribution models have been applied to map many different plants, this has rarely been attempted for mushrooms. In this study, we employed a logistic regression and a GIS expert system to model the fine-scale spatial distribution of matsutake in Yunnan southwest China Both models predicted mushroom habitat to an accuracy acceptable for resource management. The overall mapping accuracy of the GIS expert system was slightly better than the logistic regression model (70.37% versus 65.43%). Furthermore, unlike the logistic regression model, developing the GIS expert system required no field-based samples. This has important practical implications because it is very difficult to survey and sample mushrooms and other non-wood forest products (NWFP), which are usually inconspicuous species and/or lower plants. Therefore, when adequate samples are not available, incorporating local expert knowledge can help make better-informed management decisions and provide an affordable habitat identification tool.

AB Belowground competitive and complementary interactions define productivity and sustainability of mixed-species plantations to a large extent, but have received relatively little attention in the scientific literature. Belowground competitive ability is correlated with such traits as root length density, surface area and root plasticity. Competition for light can be asymmetrical with larger plants disproportionately shading smaller ones, but competition for soil resources is more symmetric. Niche separation and reduced competition below ground are commonly observed as the mechanisms that lead to coexistence of species in mixed-species plantations. Chemical interference through allelopathy may play a role in controlling the productivity of some mixed-species plantations. This paper reviews some of the well-known ecological principles by drawing examples from both temperate and tropical mixed-species plantations. We conclude that our ability to design successful mixed-species systems is constrained by limited information on belowground competitive and complementary interactions. Future research priorities that will help us expand our knowledgebase are identified. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Monitored natural attenuation (MNA) as a possible remediation strategy has been intensively discussed over the last several years. However, in order to apply natural attenuation (NA) as a rational remediation option, suitable methods for the assessment and evaluation of the efficiency of these processes must be developed, the sustainability of the NA processes has to be demonstrated and regulatory and public acceptance has to be established. The RETZ-INA (Reference test site Zeitz for the implementation of the "Natural Attenuation" approach) Project deals with the implementation of the MNA approach as a remediation concept at the heavily contaminated former industrial field site Zeitz (Germany). Due to the long history of industrial production, the multiple contaminant sources present and the large spatial extent.

AB The acute-phase proteins, C-reactive protein and serum amyloid A (SAA), are biomarkers of infection and inflammation. However, their precise role in immunity and inflammation remains undefined. We report in this study a novel property of SAA in the differential induction of Th1-type immunomodulatory cytokines IL-12 and IL-23. In peripheral blood monocytes and the THP-1 monocytic cell line, SAA induces the expression of IL-12p40, a subunit shared by IL-12 and IL-23. SAA-stimulated expression of IL-12p40 was rapid (<= 4 h), sustainable (>= 20 h), potent (up to 3380 pg/ml/10(6) cells in 24 h), and insensitive to polymyxin B treatment. The SAA-stimulated IL-12p40 secretion required de novo protein synthesis and was accompanied by activation of the transcription factors NF-kappa B and C/EBP. Expression of IL-12p40 required activation of the p38 MAPK and PI3K. Interestingly, the SAA-induced IL-12p40 production was accompanied by a sustained expression of IL-23p19, but not IL-12p35, resulting in preferential secretion of IL-23, but not IL-12. These results identify SAA as an endogenous ligand that potentially activates the IL-23/IL-17 pathway and present a novel mechanism for regulation of inflammation and immunity by an acute-phase protein.

AB The analysis of the relationships between landscape visual quality and landscape structural properties is an active area of environmental perception research. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between landscape spatial pattern and the rating of visual aesthetic quality. Eight landscape photographs were evaluated for I I visual attributes by 98 respondents. The scores obtained for these I I attributes were subjected to principal components analysis in order to summarize the qualities used by the respondents and thus determine their visual preferences. For each photograph, three window sizes were defined (with respect to a landcover map) to cover the different areas corresponding to the visual field (foreground, mid-ground and background). The landscape spatial structure for each window was analyzed using spatial metrics. The correlation between each dimension and the spatial pattern indices of the landscape were then calculated. Positive correlations were obtained between visual aesthetic quality and a number of landscape pattern indices. The results suggest that landscape heterogeneity might be an important factor in determining visual aesthetic quality. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Nickel oxide (NiO) nanotubes have been produced for the first time via a template processing method. The synthesis involved a two step chemical reaction in which nickel hydroxide (Ni(OH)(2)) nanotubes were firstly formed within the walls of an anodic aluminium oxide (AAO) template. The template was then dissolved away using concentrated NaOH, and the freed nanotubes were converted to NiO by heat treatment in air at 350 degrees C. Individual nanotubes measured 60 mu m in length with a 200 nm outer diameter and a wall thickness of 20-30 nm. The NiO nanotube powder was used in Li-ion cells for assessment of the lithium storage ability. Preliminary testing indicates that the cells demonstrate controlled and sustainable lithium diffusion after the formation of an SEI. Reversible capacities in the 300 mAh g(-1) range were typical.

AB When the migration issue is discussed in a sustainability perspective, two questions are vital. (1) What is the relationship between migration and the global population growth? (2) What is the relationship between migration and consumption growth, and how does migration influence the distribution of consumption possibilities both between and within industrialized and developing countries? Based on responses to these questions, it is argued that reasonably managed migration will be compatible with sustainable development. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Some Neo-Malthusians and anti-immigration groups in the United States have recently argued that migration of people to developed countries is damaging to sustainable development and environmental protection. This paper argues that it is inappropriate and ethically indefensible to employ environmental reasons in support of calls for restrictions on immigration to developed countries. Keeping migrants out neither solves environmental problems nor tackles the root causes of migration. Instead, developed countries should prevent armed conflicts and should promote sustainable development at home and in developing countries. If managed competently and fairly, international migration and other forms of globalization present a promise, not a threat, to a more sustainable world. (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Globalization, trade and migration: Undermining sustainability
SO ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
AB I examine the impact of expanding international trade and migration on prospects for global sustainability from a strictly biophysical/ecological/behavioral perspective. My starting premise is that techno-industrial society is inherently unsustainable. Humans have a natural propensity to expand to occupy all accessible habitats and use all available resources. Because of continuous growth propelled by improving technology, the modem human enterprise is already in a state of ecological overshoot. Globalization and trade exacerbate the situation by shuffling resources around and short-circuiting the negative feedback that would otherwise result from local resource degradation. This allows population and material growth within each individual trading region to exceed local biophysical limits. This, in turn, accelerates the depletion of natural capital everywhere and ensures that all now trade-dependent regions hit global limits simultaneously. Large-scale migration also worsens matters by reducing negative feedback and enabling increased resource consumption. Moreover, because resource scarcity is likely to precipitate conflict among self-identifying 'tribal' groups within multi-cultural societies, uncontrolled migration may create conditions that impede the implementation of policy measures required for ecological sustainability. Global sustainability is thus most likely to be achieved through policies that foster increased regional self-reliance, encourage greater investment in local natural capital, and favor the development of strong, diverse local economies 'in place.' Such measures will raise local (and therefore global) bio-capacities and reduce both the pull and push factors in international migration. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID POLICY OPTIONS
AB This paper argues that possible effects of international migration on the environment have to be analysed with respect to both the three dimensions of sustainability and the migration stakeholders. It has recently been put forward that immigration has to be reduced for environmental reasons. In contrast, this paper embarks from the view that reducing immigration is costly, ineffective and ethically troublesome. It argues that there are strong interrelations between development and migration, suggesting that one has to consider development problems when discussing migration. In this context, the enormous amount of remittances of migrant workers could yield considerable potential for promoting sustainable development. Sustainable governance is needed to manage this potential wisely. In doing so, it is essential to consider the migration stakeholders (sending and receiving countries and the migrants themselves) and balance the three dimensions of sustainability.

DT Article
DE trade and agriculture; sustainable agriculture and immigration;

AB Trade liberalisation leads to increasing exports, especially of primary products, from developing to developed economies. While the growth in export generates additional employment in rural areas, it also brings into its fold rapid exploitation of natural resources, which in the long run may hamper the very potential of growth in the sector. On the other hand, developed economies end up using more of mechnical-chemical inputs in order to minimise use of labour in the primary sector, which is generally, in short supply in these economies. Ideally, trade liberalisation should facilitate movement of farm workers from developing to developed economies as has been experienced historically. The paper argues that restricting the mobility of labour from developing economies is not only trade distorting, but also non-conducive for management of natural resources both in developing as well as developed economies. Since there are socio-cultural and political difficulties, besides environmental considerations, in promoting free movement of labour beyond a limit, it would be appropriate to harp on comensatory flow of investible funds from developed economies. This, in turn, could expidite the process of regeneration of natural resources and thereby ensure sustainable growth, as well as welfare of a large proportion of rural population in developing economies.

SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS

DT Article
ID TITANS ATMOSPHERE
AB [ 1] Radiative heat flux predictions for the Huygens probe entry into Titan's atmosphere are presented in this paper. Radiative heating was computed with the radiation code SPECAIR, assuming a Boltzmann distribution of the excited electronic levels at a characteristic temperature taken as the vibrational temperature of the gas. CN violet is found to be the most intense emitter, followed by CN red, C-2 Swan, and at early trajectory points by the first and second positive systems of N-2. Solutions of the 1-D radiative transport equation along stagnation streamlines show that self-absorption by the plasma layer reduces the total emission by up to about 20%. The fine structure of the CN violet spectra (spin-splitting) was taken into account to accurately determine self-absorption by CN violet. The potential importance of argon radiation was estimated and shown to be negligible. The resulting fluxes were found to be sustainable by the Huygens's Thermal Protection System. The feasibility of the mission was deemed possible under the updated entry parameters and atmospheric composition.

AB The rational use of water in and and semi-arid zones is fundamental for resource sustainability. The integration of aquaculture with agriculture appears to be an excellent way of saving water, disposing aquaculture effluents and providing additional fertilizer to the agricultural crop. The objective of this study was to test the feasibility of using fish effluent to irrigate cherry tomatoes cultured with different types of organic fertilizers. A field experiment was carried out in a randomized complete block design in a 2 x 5 factorial scheme, with four replications. The treatments consisted of the combination of two irrigation water types (well water and fish effluent) with five fertilizers (cow manure, chicken manure, vermicompost, commercial compost and a control without fertilization). Evaluations for tomato fruit number, productivity and mean fruit weight were performed. Statistical analyses were done in the following harvest periods: 0-25, 0-50, 0-75 and 0-100% of the harvest days. On the first three harvest periods analyzed, treatments irrigated with fish effluent had higher fruit number and productivity. This effect was more evident when the organic fertilizer used did not attend all plant needs. The higher productivity observed in effluent treatments was related to the increase in fruit number. The higher productivity in treatments with fish effluent has a special importance for small farmers, to whom fertilizers are often cost prohibitive or unavailable. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB Malawi has extreme poverty and a high-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevalence. Following Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) conjugate vaccine introduction during 2002, we evaluated vaccine impact by reviewing hospital surveillance data for acute bacterial meningitis in Blantyre district among children age 1-59 months admitted during 1997-2005. Documented annual Hib meningitis incidence rates decreased from 20-40/100,000 to near zero among both rural and urban residents despite no change in pneumococcal meningitis incidence rates. Before vaccine introduction, an average of 10 children/year had Hib meningitis and HIV infection compared to 2/year during 2003-2004 and none during 2005. Vaccine effectiveness was high following two or more doses of vaccine. The most urgent future need is for a sustainable routine infant immunization program, including a less expensive vaccine that preferably is delivered in a multivalent form. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

SO CURRENT SCIENCE

DE Himalayan musk deer; musk pod; musk trade; Neelum Valley
AB The Himalayan musk deer Moschus chrysogaster inhabits the forests of Neelum Valley, Jammu and Kashmir, including Machiara National Park. A study was made to ascertain the extent of trade in Himalayan musk and to assess the hunting pressure and present conservation status of the population of Himalayan musk deer. Musk deer are killed to excise the musk pod found in mature males between the genital organs and the umbilicus. According to information gathered from nine major professional musk traders, 26 (65%), 31 (73.8%) and 44 (97.77%) musk pods were collected illegally during 2000-02 respectively. However, cumulative total number of musk deer killed during 200002 was at least 40, 42 and 45 respectively, as revealed by data obtained from 209 hunters. Data show that though male musk deer are killed for musk pod collection, females are also killed in illegal harvesting. There is limited use of musk as traditional medicine for pulmonary diseases in the area. However, poaching activity fetches US $275-310 per musk pod; hence musk trade poses a major threat to the survival of the species. Population of Himalayan musk deer is on a rapid decline because of hunting pressure and destruction of natural habitat due to nomadic and local grazing, along with unsustainable commercial logging and extraction of medicinal plants by the government as well as by the locals. Measures to conserve the species are outlined within the framework of sustainable use of living resources for development.

ID IMAGING SPECTROMETER; SOIL-SALINITY; VEGETATION
AB Salinization of land and sweet water is an increasing problem worldwide. In the Carpathian Basin, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions, irrigation is a contributing factor to the secondary salinization problems, one of the major problems affecting soils in Hungary. Conventional broadband sensors such as SPOT, Landsat MSS, and Landsat ETM+ are not suitable for mapping soil properties, because their bandwidth of 100-200 mm cannot resolve diagnostic spectral features of terrestrial materials. Analytical techniques, developed for analysis of broadband spectral data, are incapable of taking advantage of the full range of information present in hyperspectral remote sensing imagery. In our pilot project in Tedej farm in the Great Plain Region, Hungary, the DAIS sensor was used to assess salinity risk, covering the spectral range from the visible to the thermal infrared wavelengths at 5 m spatial resolution, and other major indicators of soil salinization (NDVI, SAVI, canopy cover) were quantified with advanced remote sensing techniques using the TETRACAM ADC agricultural multispectral camera which offers red/green and NIR imaging at megapixel resolution. As a result, prominent absorption bands around 1450 nm and 1950 nm wavelength in most soil spectra are attributed to water and hydroxyl ions. Occasional weaker absorption bands caused by water also occur at 970, 1200, and 1700 nm. Absorption features near the 400 nm wavelength for all samples are also noticeable. Absorption bands at 1800 and 2300 nm are attributed to gypsum, while strong absorption features near 2350 nm are assigned to calcite (CaCo3). Saline soils exhibited significantly higher reflectance values all throughout the 325-2500 nm wavelengths of the spectrum. Soils with a high amount of soluble salts gave a higher average reflectance than soils with a low salt content. In the project, an ADC camera-based real-time integrated system was developed to take advantage of more specialized spectral information and to provide even more accurate and useful data directly from the field. The results revealed that the NDVI and SAVI index and the canopy cover mapping taken with multispectral cameras can be useful as an indirect marker and help for detecting salinization. However, we did not find a strong correlation between NDVI and soil salinity. This is probably because the detection and assessment of lower levels of salinity are difficult, mainly owing to the nature of the remotely sensed images; with such images, it is not possible to obtain information on the third dimension of the 3-D soil body. Also, the impact of salinity on electromagnetic properties needs to be explored further to understand how it can be derived indirectly from remotely sensed information. With the rapid validation of remotely sensed hyperspectral data, the decision in the future, with the best trade-off between irrigation and sustainable land use made by agricultural specialists in this region, can be more environmentally sound and more accurate using the results from the pilot.

AB Benthic foraminifera are unicellular eukaryotes found abundantly in many types of marine sediments. Many species survive and possibly reproduce in anoxic habitats(1), but sustainable anaerobic metabolism has not been previously described. Here we demonstrate that the foraminifer Globobulimina pseudospinescens accumulates intracellular nitrate stores and that these can be respired to dinitrogen gas. The amounts of nitrate detected are estimated to be sufficient to support respiration for over a month. In a Swedish fjord sediment where G. pseudospinescens is the dominant foraminifer, the intracellular nitrate pool in this species accounted for 20% of the large, cell-bound, nitrate pool present in an oxygen-free zone. Similarly high nitrate concentrations were also detected in foraminifera Nonionella cf. stella and a Stainforthia species, the two dominant benthic taxa occurring within the oxygen minimum zone of the continental shelf off Chile. Given the high abundance of foraminifera in anoxic marine environments(1-3), these new findings suggest that foraminifera may play an important role in global nitrogen cycling and indicate that our understanding of the complexity of the marine nitrogen cycle is far from complete.

AB An experimental plasmachemical reactor equipped with the novel IPP-ASCR hybrid gas-water stabilized DC torch (160 kW) has recently been started at IPP Prague for the innovative and environmentally friendly plasma treatment of waste streams with a view to their sustainable energetic and chemical valorization and to a reduction of the emission of greenhouse gases. Since the process energy is provided by direct heat transfer from plasma, gases of widely varying chemical composition may be used. The use of electrical energy also reduces the gas flows and requirements for exhaust-gas treatment, and offers control over the chemistry. Pyrolysis of biomass was experimentally studied using wood chips as a model substance. Syngas with a high content of hydrogen and CO was produced. The influence of adding CO2 for increase of oxygen content in the reactor was investigated. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In intensive agricultural systems, efficient nutrient use is necessary for high crop yields as well as for sustainable environmental management. Recent studies in temperate regions indicate that non-exchangeable NH4+-N (NEA), which is fixed in clay minerals, may affect crop productivity and soil N dynamics more than previously thought. To estimate the quantity and plant availability of NEA in Swedish soils, ryegrass (Lolium perenne) was grown in a pot experiment using 18 soils that were collected (0-20 cm depth) from two long-term agricultural experiment series at five locations. Initial NEA, total N and soil K contents were measured, as well as NEA content 56, 112 and 168 days after planting of ryegrass. The results show that the soils (0-20 cm) contained 21-217 mg NEA kg(-1) sieved soil (5 - 300 kg NEA ha(-1)) estimated as corresponding to 0.1 - 5.1% of the total soil N. Long-term application of farmyard manure (FYM) did not increase contents of soil NEA. Long-term application of K fertilizer increased soil contents of AL-extractable K, but there was no significant correlation with NEA content. Concurrent with ryegrass growth, NEA content decreased on average by 16% between day 0 and day 112, indicating that NEA was released from the soil and taken up by the plants.

AB The purpose of the present study was to ascertain whether it is possible to substitute animal protein in a pig diet with lupine of Sonet cultivar or amaranth grain or dried surface biomass of amaranth when one type feed ration is used during the entire period of fattening, and to investigate its impact on growth efficiency and health of pigs. Its role in feed conversion, carcass characteristics, meat quality and sensory parameters was analyzed.
   Four groups of pigs (n = 10, 5 males and 5 females) with the body weight of 24 kg were fed semi-ad libitum for 90 days the following diets: control group (C) - diet containing 3% of fish meal, experimental group (1) - diet containing 5% of non-heat-treated amaranth grain and 5% of dried surface biomass of amaranth, experimental group (2) - diet containing 5% of popped (heat-treated) amaranth grain and 5% of dried surface amaranth biomass, experimental group (3) - diet containing 10% of lupine seed meal. Animal protein substitution in diets with amaranth (group 1, 2) or lupine (3) did not result in significant differences (p > 0.05) in average daily body weight gain in comparison with the control group (C - 0.83 and 0.82, 0.80 and 0.79 kg in groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively). The differences in feed conversion were non-significant (2.69 to 2.79 kg/kg of body weight gain). The tested diets did not adversely affect animal metabolism, and significantly lower concentrations (p < 0.05, p < 0.01) of total protein, glucose and triacylglycerol in animals of group C ranged within physiological limits. No significant differences between control and experimental animals were found in carcass characteristics, meat and sensory qualities. Lupine supplementation of the diet positively affected the tenderness and taste of meat.

AB Siberian rivers are of global importance as they impact on the freshwater budget of the Arctic Ocean, which affects the Thermo-Haline circulation in the North Atlantic Ocean. Siberian rivers, in particular the tributaries to the larger rivers, are under-represented in the international river-regime databases. The runoff of three Russian rivers in the Central Siberian taiga (Kureyka, Karabula and Erba) is modelled to analyse the relative influence of climate. In addition three rivers (Rhine, Maas and Odra) in Western Europe are similarly assessed as a control. The results show that the role of precipitation and autocorrelation as factors in the formation of river runoff is stronger under oceanic climate conditions, increasing from the central regions of Northern Eurasia towards the Arctic Ocean in the North and the Atlantic in the West. At the same time the influence of summer temperatures is weakened. The formation of Northern Eurasian river runoff appears to be influenced by periodically thawing top horizons of permafrost soil. Time served as an indicator for land use change after inclusion of meteorological data in the models. Maas and Erba showed a significant influence of the time factor. For the Erba the onset of agricultural land use in the catchment coincides with a drop in runoff. A similar causal relationship is suggested for the Maas. Land use can change the formation of runoff, which in turn can be used as an environmental indicator for sustainable land use. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The provision of food causes environmental impacts that range from local through to global in scale. Organic farming, used in general here to mean farming practices with a greater emphasis on long-term sustainability, is one general approach to reduce these impacts. Whilst organic farming may be argued to be superior to conventional farming on the basis of local impacts, it is not often clear how organic farming performs relative to conventional farming in terms of wider, global impacts. In this paper we present a comparative assessment of onfarm and indirect energy consumption, land disturbance, water use, employment, and emissions of greenhouse gases, NOx, and SO2 of organic and conventional farming in Australia. A hybrid input-output-based life-cycle technique is employed in order to ensure a complete coverage of indirect requirements originating from all upstream production stages. Using data from a detailed survey of organic farms, the results show that direct energy use, energy related emissions, and greenhouse gas emissions are higher for the organic farming sample than for a comparable conventional farm sample. Direct water use and employment are significantly lower for the organic farms than for the conventional farms. However, the indirect contributions for all factors are much higher for the conventional farms, leading to their total impacts being substantially higher. This shows that indirect effects must be taken into account in the consideration of the environmental consequences of farming, in particular for energy use and greenhouse gas emissions, where the majority of impacts usually occur off-farm. Subject to yield uncertainties for organic versus conventional farming, from the sample here we can conclude that in addition to their local benefits, organic farming approaches can reduce the total water, energy and greenhouse gases involved in food production.

AB A stochastic model for simulating mountain beef cattle systems was described and validated using real data. The model was able to properly simulate complex batches of animals with different initial characteristics and so obtain results about the mean and variance of animal productive and reproductive outputs. Model was used to simulate four feeding strategies during winter period in the conditions of autumn calving in the Spanish Pyrenees. The simulated strategies were CONTROL: 100% of recommendations for the mean animal; LOW1: as 24% restriction from the amount of energy provided to CONTROL, applied only during lactation; LOW2: the same of LOW1, but was applied only the last two thirds of lactation; LOW3: 16% restriction from CONTROL applied at late gestation and first third of lactation. Simulated results showed that restrictions around 25% of the total winter energy requirements of beef cows in housing conditions are possible and sustainable. The best option taking into account reproductive performance and outputs variability seems to be a continuous restriction during all lactation (strategy LOW1). On the other hand, an extensification policy implying extended grazing till mid or late December with housing afterwards (strategy LOW3), is also possible and will have no negative consequences on calf growth (only viability of young calves being outdoors in autumn should be evaluated), but can affect the PPA of cows and so the herd reproductive performance could be compromised in the long term.

AB The energy efficiency and economic benefits of agroforestry systems are key issues with respect to their actual sustainability as sound agricultural practices as well as to their potential for further development. Two typical agroforestry systems in China, the Paulownia [Paulownia elongta S.Y. Hu] intercropping system in the north and the Tea [Camellia sinensis O. Ktze] intercropping system in the south were chosen as research subjects. The studies were conducted to establish the energy balance and economic benefits to farmers of these two agroforestry systems in northern and southern China. The objectives were to determine the potential of developing the Paulownia intercropping system in the north and the Tea intercropping system in the south, and their respective sustainability. Two research sites were selected, and two intercropping systems were designed. All the inputs/outputs data of these two agroforestry systems were collected and documented. Input/output analysis and process analysis were conducted. Energy output/input ratio of Paulownia intercropping system was 1.39, of Non-Paulownia intercropping system (traditional cropping system) was 1.27, an increase of 9.45%. Economic output/input ratios of Paulownia and Non-Paulownia intercropping systems were 2.42 and 2.25, respectively, an increase of 7.56%. Ratios under Tea and Non-Tea intercropping systems reflected the same trend. The Tea energy output/input ratio record was 1.12, compared to 0.06 of the Non-Tea intercropping system, i.e. the former is 18.7 times higher than the latter. Economic output/input ratios under Tea intercropping system (2.3) was 64.29% higher than that of the Non-Tea intercropping system (1.4). It was concluded that these two typical agroforestry intercropping systems have a higher energy efficiency and also a better financial benefits to farmers. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Natural habitats are considered inherently indispensable to the global economy by conservationists, but few natural ecosystems afford direct and quantifiable economic benefits. Quantification of natural land value can provide compelling evidence favoring preservation over development. Wild bees are important pollinators of many crop plants. and natural patches in agroecosystems enhance pollinator services and crop yield. Bee abundance was greatest in canola fields that had more uncultivated land within 750 m of field edges and seed set was greater in fields with higher bee abundance. A cost-benefit model that estimates profit in canola agroecosystems with different proportions of uncultivated land is presented. Yield and profit could be maximized with 30% of land uncultivated within 750 m of field edges. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In an effort to assess agroforestry adoption potential among a diverse Pennsylvania landowner population, a mail survey instrument was sent to 250 members of the Pennsylvania Association of Sustainable Agriculture (PASA) and 250 members of Woodland Owner Associations (WOA). Current management objectives and production strategies, agroforestry awareness, agroforestry interest, and perceptions regarding the benefits and obstacles to agroforestry adoption were gauged. Market segmentation was performed with a two-step cluster analysis to produce four agroforestry adoption potential models: Timber-Related Practices, Livestock-Related Practices, Specialty Crop-Related Practices, and Non-Adopters. The analyses showed that agroforestry practices could indeed satisfy specific land management objectives within diverse populations. The key to outreach success and adoption will be to engage these landowner groups according to their unique interests and values, and to demonstrate the potential agroforestry has to enhance existing objectives.

AB Where long forest-fallows are no longer practiced, productivity declines in the absence of input substitution, as does the ability of subsistence farmers to earn an adequate livelihood from shifting cultivation. Land availability, population density and productivity-related factors such as soil fertility and labour requirements are not the only factors that affect fallow length and land use intensification in shifting cultivation agroforestry systems. Households surveyed indicated that various other decision criteria (e.g., proximity to other fields and the protection of land use rights) are important in land use decisions. Even though one quarter of households reported insufficient land resources to maintain soil fertility, few actually indicated that their choices were constrained by land availability. In fact, many cleared much younger fallows than strictly necessary based on the age of fallows available in their land holdings - even those with fallows of sufficient age to maintain long-term productivity. This paper outlines an approach to quantify information about the household preferences that influence land use decisions, discusses the implications of these decision criteria for land use intensification and uses them to model household decision-making in a way that effectively simulates the spatial and dynamic mosaic of land use characteristic of shifting cultivation. Not only are non-productivity related decision criteria important in land use decisions in general; they also have a significant impact on land use intensification. In fact, the research described here demonstrates that both household-specific preferences and household-specific initial conditions can lead to intensification of land use apart from that arising due to increasing population density.

TI Yield-water supply relationships of grain sorghum and winter wheat

ID CENTRAL GREAT-PLAINS; CROPPING SYSTEMS; TILLAGE; CROPS; STORAGE; FALLOW
AB Agricultural sustainability in the USA's west-central Great Plains depends on efficient use of water-the primary yield-limiting factor in the region. With perennially water-short status, the efficient capture and storage of precipitation in soil, and the yield responsiveness of crops to water, are emphasized. Our objective was to quantify grain sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] and winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) yield responses to stored soil water and precipitation by using data gleaned from research conducted from 1973 to 2004 near Tribune, KS on Ulysses silt loam (fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Haplustolls) and Richfield silt loam (fine, smectitic, mesic Aridic Argiustolls) soils. Soil water content was measured gravimetrically to the 183-cm depth at crop emergence. Grain yield was related to available soil water at emergence (ASW(e)) (increased 221 kg ha(-1) cm(-1) in sorghum and 98 kg ha(-1) cm(-1) in wheat). Grain yield was also related to in-season precipitation (ISP) (increased 164 kg ha(-1) cm(-1) in sorghum and 83 kg ha(-1) cm(-1) in wheat). From response-surface analyses, 63% (sorghum) and 70% (wheat) of variations in grain yield were explained by variations in ASW(e) and ISP. In data sorted by tillage, yield response to water supply (WS) was greater with no-till than with conventional tillage in both crops (184 vs. 129 kg ha(-1) cm(-1) in sorghum; 138 vs. 86 kg ha(-1) cm(-1) in wheat). This finding supports the concept that less tillage and more residue lead to more efficient use during the growing season of ASW, and ISP.

AB To determine the ability of antiretroviral treatment (ART) to deter viral replication in the long term, we tested autologous neutralization of HIV-1 primary isolates in sera from six chronically HIV-1-infected patients before and during such treatment. For comparison, heterologous neutralization was tested in the same samples by using a panel of eight primary HIV-1 isolates. Preceding ART, none of the patients' samples contained neutralizing antibodies against autologous HIV-1 isolates. Subsequently, despite successful ART treatment during a 12- to 19-month period and a rise in CD4 T cell counts, the patients' viral neutralizing capacity did not increase significantly. Furthermore, the partial heterologous neutralizing response was not improved in these patients. This outcome signifies the failure of an HIV-1-specific humoral immune response to improve, despite successful ART. Therefore, our results emphasize the need for immunologic intervention before cessation of ART in chronically HIV-1-infected patients to achieve sustainable control of viral replication.

TI The speed of learning in noisy games: Partial reinforcement and the
   sustainability of cooperation
SO AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
ID PRISONERS-DILEMMA; RATIONAL COOPERATION; FORM GAMES; MODELS;
   INFORMATION; EVOLUTION; BEHAVIOR; RULES; PLAY
AB In an experiment, players' ability to learn to cooperate in the repeated prisoner's dilemma was substantially diminished when the payoffs were noisy, even though players could monitor one another's past actions perfectly. In contrast, in one-time play against a succession of opponents, noisy payoffs increased cooperation, by slowing the rate at which cooperation decays. These observations are consistent with the robust observation from the psychology literature that partial reinforcement (adding randomness to the link between an action and its consequences while holding expected payoffs constant) slows learning. This effect is magnified in the repeated game: when others are slow to learn to cooperate, the benefits of cooperation are reduced, which further hampers cooperation. These results show that a small change in the payoff environment, which changes the speed of individual learning, can have a large effect on collective behavior. And they show that there may be interesting comparative dynamics that can be derived from careful attention to the fact that at least some economic behavior is learned from experience.

TI Quieting educational reform... With educational reform
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EVALUATION
LA English
DT Article
DE school reform; evaluator role; evaluation contexts; evaluation ethics
AB The authors report on an evaluation of a comprehensive school reform initiative in one elementary school intended to provide meaningful and sustainable structure, substance, and support to the school's critical need to improve students' standardized test scores. Serious implementation and communication problems during the year of the evaluation suggested that the reform itself was misdirected. Teachers' accounts of their participation in the initiative suggested that some experienced it as a confusing set of external programs they were required to implement without adequate training or support. Sometimes, the reform programs actually conflicted with test preparation pressures and activities, and even with one another. The authors struggled as evaluators to find ways to connect to the dynamics of this complicated context, especially ways that could enact their evaluative commitments to responsiveness, the public good, and ethical practice. They were thwarted by apathy, withdrawal, and silence. This article offers the authors' reflections on the contours of evaluative commitments in challenging contexts.

AB We hypothesize that administration of acute and daily doses of raloxifene will have significant effects on ovine coronary and uterine hemodynamics and that these changes are estrogen receptor dependent. Eleven ovariectomized sheep were instrumented to measure mean arterial pressure, heart rate (HR), cardiac output (CO), and coronary (CBF) and uterine artery blood flows (UBF). A dose-response curve was generated for raloxifene (1, 3, and 10 mu g/kg) and compared with a standard dose of estradiol-17 beta (1 mu g/kg) given intravenously. In a second group of animals, raloxifene (10 mu g (.) kg-1 (.) day-1) was administered intravenously for 14 consecutive days, and cardiovascular responses were compared with a group of animals administered estradiol-17 beta (10 mu g/kg) daily for the same period. To determine whether raloxifene-related vascular responses were estrogen receptor (ER) mediated, the animals were pretreated with estrogen antagonist ICI-182,780 given intravenously. Finally, RT-PCR was preformed to determine the presence of ER alpha and ER beta mRNA in ovine coronary and uterine vessels. Raloxifene increased CBF and UBF dose dependently with a parallel decrease in the associated vascular resistances. Acute cardiovascular responses to daily doses of raloxifene and estradiol-17 beta were sustainable. In contrast to estradiol-17 beta, which significantly increases CO by increasing HR but not stroke volume, raloxifene significantly increased stroke volume without a significant parallel increase in HR. ICI-182,780 abolished raloxifene-induced hemodynamic responses, and ER beta and ER beta mRNA are present in both ovine coronary and uterine vessels. Hence, the hemodynamic effects of raloxifene are dose dependent, sustainable, and estrogen receptor mediated.

AB Long-term cropping systems research is important in order to reduce production costs, to control crop pests, and to optimize the sustainability of agro-ecosystems. Soil amendment use, improved disease management practices, and careful cultivar choice are some of the potential components for improving potato production systems. This research was conducted in long-term cropping systems plots in order to evaluate the impact of soil amendments, pest management practices, and cultivar on foliar and soil-borne potato diseases and to assess the relationships of soil and pest management practices to disease levels and soil microbial activity. Fungicide applications for management of foliar diseases varied betweem the pest management systems (e.g., biological, reduced input, and conventional). Incidence of potato follar diseases was quantified five times during the cropping season. The impact of soil amendment and pest management practices on soil microbial activity and tuber-borne diseases was also investigated. Low incidences of follar and selected soil-borne diseases were recorded. Disease levels varied between years, cultivars, pest management, and soil amendments. Significant differences between cultivars were detected for early blight, white mold, and black dot. The cultivar Superior had higher incidence of white mold and black dot, while cv Atlantic had higher early blight incidence. Pest management system significantly affected foliar early blight incidence in 1998, but not in 1997. Pest management system did not affect late blight, white mold, or black dot incidence, or tuber disease incidence in either year. The addition of soil amendments significantly impacted tuber black dot incidences. Microbial activity responded to increasing temperature as the season progressed and was significantly enhanced by the addition of manure and compost soil amendments; however, lower disease incidence was not associated with increased microbial activity. While pest management practices were not major determinants of disease levels in these experiments, the results show that soil amendments can increase incidence of selected tuber diseasesand microbial activity in soils.

ID UGANDA
AB Disease is one of the main threats to the remaining great ape populations of the world. The decision to intervene in the health of the great apes for population sustainability is controversial. Humans' increasing negative influence on great ape health has mandated the reevaluation of current management policies. The Mountain Gorilla Veterinary Project (MGVP) has been making health intervention decisions since 1986. The decision to intervene has often been made subjectively due to poorly defined criteria that are often influenced by emotion. This paper provides a consistent framework for evidence-based health intervention decision-making. The decision tree is a five-tier process consisting of routine sentinel health observation, intensive follow-up veterinary health observation, outbreak assessment, risk assessment, and risk management. Although this paper focuses on the mountain gorillas, it serves as a basis for evidence-based decision-making in other species. Am. J. Primatol. 68:909-927, 2006. (c) 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB Commercial realities have drastically reduced private investment in the development of new public health tools, but increased awareness of this situation has resulted in the emergence of a variety of research-based, nonprofit organizations. We reviewed current vaccine developments and developed a framework for efficient research and development investments in this area.
   We have identified several key "push" and "pull" forces within the vaccine research and product development environment and have examined their impacts on the process. These forces affect the global vaccine pipeline, which is composed of all individual vaccine initiatives and global partnerships (i.e., stakeholders), All of these research and development stakeholders must work together to establish and promote a global, sustainable research and development pipeline that delivers optimal vaccines and immunization technologies.

AB In order to cope with the increasing demand for gasoline and the need to reduce environmental impact for sustainable development, refineries have installed refining technology by introducing cracking, reforming, isomerization and alkylation. The standard EN 228: 2004 outlines the specification that gasoline, deriving from the blend of several fractions, must have for use in modern piston engines. Naphtha is one of the products from distilling crude oil that can be used as starting material in the reforming process whose derivatives, which are a fraction of gasoline, depend on the composition of the naphtha. Knowledge of the naphtha composition thus enables to provide the final composition of the products of reforming, the efficiency of the plant and also provides information about the crude oil used. In this paper some naphtha samples were analysed by multidimensional gas chromatography. This technique allows in a single analysis a good separation of the hydrocarbon types and within each hydrocarbon type a good carbon number separation.

AB OBJECTIVE: To determine which interventions are effective in influencing health practitioners' prescribing practices and explore differences in intervention complexity, setting, sustainability, cost effectiveness, and impact on patient outcomes.
   METHODS: A systematic search for English-language systematic reviews was performed in MEDLINE, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library from the date of inception to July 2005 using search terms in accordance with Cochrane recommendations. Included reviews were required to clearly report a search strategy, inclusion/exclusion criteria, literature assessment criteria, and methods for synthesizing or summarizing information and references. Two reviewers independently identified studies for inclusion, assessed study quality, and extracted relevant information. Interventions were classified as consistently effective, inconsistently effective, and effectiveness uncertain.
   RESULTS: Thirty-four of 4585 titles reviewed met the inclusion criteria. Quality scores ranged from 70% to 100%. Consistently effective interventions included reminders (manual and computerized), audit and feedback, educational outreach visits, organizational strategies, and patient-mediated interventions. Inconsistently effective interventions included computer decision support systems and educational meetings. Multi-faceted interventions were consistently shown to be more efficacious than single interventions. Limited data precluded exploration of the effects of interventions in different settings, sustainability of effect, cost effectiveness, and patient clinical outcomes.
   CONCLUSIONS: Interventions that are most effective for impacting prescribing practice include audit and feedback, reminders, educational outreach visits, and patient-mediated interventions. To maximize impact, pharmacists' efforts to positively impact prescribing practices should focus on these intervention types rather than relying primarily on passive didactics or dissemination of guidelines.

TI Land reform, range ecology, and carrying capacities in Namaqualand,

AB In South African rangeland management, there is a long history of using the notion of carrying capacity as a central planning tool for environmental conservation and agricultural modernization. Today, in the new South Africa, the "need'' for livestock keepers to adhere to a defined carrying capacity in order to conserve rangeland resources and to achieve economic development remains an institutionalized "fact.'' In this article, we use interviews, livestock and rainfall data, policy documents, and aerial photos to discuss the idea of carrying capacity as it is currently used in the implementation of land reform in Namaqualand in the Northern Cape Province. This article is a contribution at the interface of human ecology and political ecology, linking environmental issues to economic constraints, land rights, social justice, and values. Policymakers and extension services usually see carrying capacity as a purely technical issue. We argue that this is problematic because it gives privilege to environmental sustainability and to one particular perception of the ideal landscape at the expense of livelihood security and poverty alleviation. It also perpetuates the colonial myth that the private ranch system is an ideal one, independent of disparate production goals and unequal economic opportunities and constraints, and it ignores evidence going back more than half a century that the Namaqualand range is capable of sustaining livestock densities far greater than those recommended. The winners that emerge from the current policy focus on carrying capacity are the few emergent black commercial farmers as well as conservationist interests; the losers are the majority of poor stockowners in the communal areas.

AB 1. Fish species are used globally for fundamental research, product and environmental testing, and education, but this use has not hitherto been documented. The number of fish used for research and education in North America currently represents approximately one-quarter of all animal use for these purposes; only mice are used in higher numbers. Data from the Canadian Council on Animal Care, various animal care committees from Canadian universities, and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service are collated and summarized.
   2. In Canada nearly a half a million fish were used for research and education each year from 1996 to 2001. We estimated that the United States used over four times that amount for the same purposes, totalling approximately 2.8 million fish each year.
   3. At least 100 fish species, representing 27 taxonomic orders, were used for research and education in North America from 1996 to 2001. Close to one-third of the species had life-history characteristics that might make them particularly susceptible to over-exploitation. This potential vulnerability, coupled with data from animal care facilities in Canada suggesting that nearly half of all fish used for research and education were wild-caught, should prompt further documentation of such fish uses in order to assess their sustainability.

AB 1. As the interest of divers in exploring marine protected areas grows, so does their impact on sensitive marine organisms and communities. This situation has led managers to adopt a variety of measures to manage scuba diving in marine reserves. However, if marine areas need to be managed and protected from the adverse effects of human activities, then the characterization of marine habitats and the communities they contain, along with the potential effects of scuba diving, will need to be evaluated on scientific lines.
   2. To this end, the use of benthic mapping, together with an evaluation of community vulnerability, constitutes a complementary tool for managing scuba diving, as is demonstrated in the present study.
   3. The identification and evaluation of the different communities observed in Cabo de Palos-Islas Hormigas Marine Reserve enables managers to propose different measures for controlling potential diver impact and also for evaluating the effects of these measures, thus reducing the degradation of the benthic organisms and communities, benefiting the local tourism industry and allowing a more sustainable use of the marine reserve resources.

AB Over the past thirty years, Portugal has experienced wide transformations in its planning system, resulting from the incorporation of principles and policy agendas mandated by the EU, established practices in other countries, or from the diffusion of "home-grown" experiences. Despite increased dissemination of principles of decentralization, democratization, efficiency and sustainable development, plans have maintained an ineffective regulatory nature, instead of serving as strategic processes to rethink what we would like our territory to be.

AB Recent evidence points to warmer and wetter conditions for Arctic regions. It is not clear how High Arctic environments, in particular extensive wetlands, will respond to these rapid changes. Sustainability studies of wetland complexes will require accurate mapping of water bodies (lakes, ponds, streams) over time. This information is critical to obtain reliable estimates of water inputs (e.g., snowmelt), outputs (e.g., evaporation), and storage, and to assess environmental change (e.g., pond desiccation, expansion, or both). Numerous tools and techniques are available to provide this information, though each approach has its benefits and limitations. In this study, we systematically explore the differences and similarities inherent in three different techniques used to delineate lakes and small ponds at an extensive wetland area near Creswell Bay, Somerset Island, Nunavut (72 degrees 43'N, 94 degrees 15'W). The mapping techniques compared are satellite mapping (extraction from a satellite-based land cover map), black-and-white aerial photography, and a topographic map sheet. Results indicate that while all three techniques could delineate large lake boundaries and their positions successfully, they differed in the number of ponds they delineated, as well as their boundaries and positions. A misrepresentation of water bodies can hinder hydrologic studies of Arctic water resources, and the results of this study emphasize the need to apply appropriate mapping techniques at different scales. The three mapping techniques are based on data from three different dates over several decades, so the different results also may indicate short- and long-term environmental change.

AB Contemporary survival for post-Soviet Russia's indigenous communities is complicated both by a Soviet legacy that undermined local ecological knowledge, kinship settlement patterns, land and resource rights, and robust ecosystems, and by the contemporary effects of globalization and modernity. Efforts to achieve sustainability lack a focus on local contexts, although recent research, especially in anthropology, underscores the need to develop sustainability criteria that are both flexible and adaptable to local contexts. Community-based research in post-Soviet Viliui Sakha indigenous communities of northeastern Siberia, Russia, has shown that inhabitants define sustainability as the building of local diversified economies, communities, and health via strong local leadership, a shared vision to work toward common goals, the reinstatement of local knowledge, and rights to land and resources. Realization of these ideas may be achieved by continued collaboration between circumpolar researchers and communities to facilitate the influx of ideas and models of success from other Arctic regions and by potential outcomes of intergovernmental action between the Russian Federation and its circumpolar neighbors through Russia's chairing of the Arctic Council. Implementation of flexible, locally adaptable sustainability criteria is central to these efforts.

   vegetation; nesting site; Spain; vegetation height
ID CONSERVATION; BIOLOGY
AB The selection of an appropriate site for nesting is of vital importance in birds, especially in ground nesting species as Montagu's Harrier Circus pygargus. This raptor mainly uses cereal crops as nesting habitat, although natural vegetation is also used in some European areas. Vegetation height is one of the main factors affecting nest location in cereal crops but there is no data on its importance in natural habitats. In Castellon province (NE Spain), the species uses shrublands as breeding habitat, which provides the opportunity to explore the importance of vegetation height in birds breeding in natural areas. In this study, we compared vegetation height at nests with vegetation height in the surrounding of the nests, and at random points within patches occupied by harriers. Mean vegetation height at nests was 83.5 cm (SD 17.2), which corresponds to observations in other natural vegetation sites and cereal crops. At one metre from nests, the vegetation was higher, with a mean value of 109 cm (SD 16.0). Mean vegetation height at random points was also 109 cm. This contrasts with observations in cereal crops, where nests are located in sites where vegetation height is equal or higher than the surrounding vegetation. In our study area vegetation height seems to play an important role in determining the exact location of nests within a patch, but in terms of vegetation height the areas used by harriers for nesting do not differ from the rest of the patch. This suggests that most sectors of the patches are potentially suitable for nesting, with the selection of shorter vegetation for the exact location of the nest probably resulting of a trade-off between nest protection and nest accessibility. As populations breeding in cereals need human intervention to be sustainable, and in the absence of conservation measures breeding output is higher in natural habitat than in farmland, the protection of populations inhabiting natural habitats may be important for the conservation of the species in a wider context, as they may act as sources of harriers for other areas.

AB Human geographers' research into lay responses to burgeoning environmental issues has highlighted their mediated and contingent constitution. Situated within the discipline's cultural turn, this work has challenged prevailing informational and cognitive approaches to sustainability. In doing so, however, potentially informative concepts and findings from environmental psychology have been sidelined. In this paper I attempt a modest allying of the two sub-disciplines, outlining their differences and similarities, and arguing that environmental psychology can triangulate with human geography, as well as challenge tendencies within human geography literatures to simplify the 'psychological' subject.

TI A good international citizen? Australia at the world summit on
   sustainable development
SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
LA English
DT Article
ID GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL DIPLOMACY; FOREIGN-POLICY PRIORITIES;
   EUROPEAN-UNION
AB Australia has often been identified as a middle power in foreign policy terms. This article assesses the worth of the concept in understanding the role of Australia in global environmental governance. Using a case study of the role played at the World Summit on Sustainable Development, it assesses whether Australia conformed to a classic middle power role, building coalitions as a 'good international citizen' or whether its role was more like a veto state, preventing positive change. This is done via a reflection on Australia's Summit priorities and an assessment of its impact over the Summit outcomes. The article shows that Australia was able to offer leadership in certain specific areas, but overall domestic policy preferences, a growing mistrust of multilateralism, and a strong defence of the national interest meant that Australia played the role of a veto state, often in coalition with the United States of America.

AB We present a laboratory practice aimed to clarify and discuss the concept of bioindicator molecules in environmental health. It has been implemented as a hands- on laboratory exercise in postgraduate courses in public health ( in Brazil) and in a course entitled Biology Applied to Natural Resources Sustainability ( in Spain) but can be useful for undergraduate studies. By simple, repeatable, and low cost spectrophotometry methodology, students detect minimal concentrations ( nmol) of metallothionein in biological samples obtained from sites with various status of pollution. They can also expose experimental fish or mollusks to heavy metals in aquarium conditions and then detect metallothionein. This method is excellent for didactic purposes because it can be developed even in modest laboratories with basic equipment for molecular biology.

AB This is the first review on taxonomy, morphology, ecology, conservation and utilisation of Abies guatemalensis, an endangered endemic conifer in Central America. The species became recently split up in seven varieties with a distinct geographic pattern. A number of morphological traits separate the species from the co-occurring A. hickelii and A. religiosa. The species is used for charcoal production, as valuable timber and (more recently) as highly priced greenery. However, utilisation is not sustainable and may lead to regional extinction within few decades. Protection of the species seems to be most efficient if based on community forest management. As a new conservation tool we suggest establishment of Christmas tree and greenery plantations which could generate significant income for the local farmers. The existing knowledge on A. guatemalensis should be used to steer utilisation, to generate livelihood improvements for the local Maya communities, and to optimise regional and national conservation efforts. Conservation of the species is urgent because it occurs in endangered highland forests which provide significant ecosystem services including erosion control and supply of drinking water. Inconsistencies in description of the species and gaps in knowledge are highlighted and future research directions suggested.

AB This paper argues that improving the communication between landholders and ecologists will result in better conservation outcomes for ecosystem management on private land. It examines a case study of ecological research on frogs undertaken on private, agricultural land in south-eastern Australia. The paper questions the traditional separation of ecological science from landholders specifically and the public in general. In addressing this issue the authors wish to improve the relevance of ecology for landholders, raise the profile of social science for ecologists working on private land and examine the implications of improving ecologist - landholder relationships. For landholders, an improved understanding of the ecological context of their agricultural activities may lead to sustainability gains. For ecologists, a deeper appreciation for the social context of their ecological research provides an opportunity to see how their work is perceived and/or acted upon in practice. For both parties, a communicative relationship may minimise future need for ecosystem repair. Such an approach (for both landholders and ecologists) can lead to the break down of stereotypes and/or a greater appreciation of the others' perspectives, constraints and values with respect to conservation on private land. In the productive discussions arising from conversations between landholders and ecologists, new approaches to sustainable land management and nature conservation may emerge.

ID FOREST; IMPACT
AB Sustainable use of wild populations of medicinal plants (as with other non-timber forest products) requires robust assessment of the distribution and abundance of target species. Long-term population dynamics datasets are typically unavailable in many developing countries, and then perhaps only for one to few high profile taxa. Given the scale and urgency of sustainability issues, one-off inventories provide the only realistic means for assessing the population status and harvest potential of assemblages of target resource species. Quantitative examples of such assessments are very rare, and limited in scale. As part of a national programme focusing on developing sustainable usage of medicinal plants in five biogeographically representative Medicinal Plant Conservation Areas (MPCAs) in Sri Lanka, we describe the rapid appraisal methodology developed for, and substantive results derived from, a resource inventory undertaken at respective MPCAs to provide: (a) baseline assessment of the distributions, associated population structures and densities, and ecological requirements of medicinal plant species; and (b) an informed basis for ongoing in situ conservation, management, and harvest sustainability of defined priority medicinal plant species. The applied methodology comprised: (a) quantitative assessment of medicinal plant populations and habitat features at 898 inventory plots, located using a strict hierarchical stratification; (b) standard numerical classificatory procedures to define major habitat types; and (c) areal estimates of habitats based on available fine-scale topographic mapping, augmented with refined mapping derived from Landsat TM imagery. Over 1400 medicinal plant species (ca. 40% of the national flora) were sampled during the inventory, occurring in habitat conditions ranging from dense-canopied, relatively undisturbed tropical forest, to savanna. Most vegetation was of a secondary nature reflecting ancient and varied histories of chena (slash and burn) cultivation, grassland/savanna burning for pastoral purposes, and recent logging. Medicinal plant species density was significantly correlated overall with higher rainfall, higher elevation, deeper and more acid soils. Derived population estimates and structures, and the potential for sustainable harvest from the wild, are assessed for 34 priority medicinal plant species. Results demonstrate the very low resource base of most priority species, and the varied habitat and disturbance requirements of medicinal plants in Sri Lankan reserves. It follows that (a) greater attention needs to be given to ex situ propagation and farming of medicinal plant resources-although for many long-lived perennial taxa this is likely to be impractical; (b) there can be no one management prescription which caters for all component species; and (c) for effective conservation local communities need to be actively involved in managing natural vegetation habitats (albeit under regulated conditions), including imposition of various forms of small-scale disturbances such as harvesting and, where appropriate, fire management.

AB The current Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs) regulations for finished pharmaceuticals and medical devices have been around, in one form or another, for over 25 years. During this time, FDA has provided interpretation and guidance to aid companies in their efforts to comply. Yet, when found to be out of compliance by FDA, some companies experience difficulty making effective corrections in a timely manner. When compliance is finally achieved, it is only after several failures and misdirected expenditures of time and money, often leading to chronic deficiencies even more difficult to remedy. To achieve effective, sustainable corrections to GMP deficiencies, companies need to take a systems-based, organizational approach to compliance.

AB Studies were carried out on honeybees foraging on plant flowers. Results showed significantly higher foraging response of honeybees (Apis mellifera) in genetically divergent narcotic plant opium poppy (Papaver somniferum). Of the 18 mutants and two locally adapted cultivars of diverse genotypes screened, eight revealed significantly greater foraging response manifesting honeybee's preference towards specific plant morphotypes. The number of flower bloom did not correspond to number of foraging bees in both mutant and cultivar plant types of opium poppy. The genotype specific foraging response of honeybees could be attributed to physico-chemical properties of opium poppy flowers. This could have implications for the development of opium alkaloid fortified honeys for novel pharmaceuticals and isolation of natural spray compounds to attract honeybee pollinators for promoting crossing and sustainable hybridity in crops.

AB Grasshoppers are insect herbivores common to grassland ecosystems worldwide. They comprise important components of biodiversity, contribute significantly to grassland function, and periodically exhibit both local and large-scale outbreaks. Because of grasshoppers' potential economic importance as competitors with ungulate grazers for rangeland forage, periodic grasshopper outbreaks in western US rangeland often elicit intervention over large areas in the form of chemical control. Available information combined with alternative underlying conceptual frameworks suggests that new approaches for sustainable management of grasshopper outbreaks in US rangeland should be pursued. There are many reasons to believe that approaches to grasshopper management that aim to reduce or prevent outbreaks are possible. These habitat manipulation tactics maintain existing ecological feedbacks responsible for sustaining populations at economically nonthreatening levels. Sustainable strategies to minimize the likelihood and extent of grasshopper outbreaks while limiting the need for chemical intervention are a rational and attainable goal for managing grasslands as renewable resources.

AB In order to comply with sustainable development policy, the minimum that buildings should achieve are a healthy, comfortable and energy-efficient environment. Criteria for individually assessing each of the many criteria are known: the occupant's perceived health; the provided thermal, visual and acoustical comfort; and the indoor air quality and energy efficiency. A methodology is proposed to perform a global evaluation of a building with regard to all these criteria. This methodology is applied to a sample of 96 apartment buildings and 64 office buildings to determine a set of best buildings and a set of buildings that are not acceptable in terms of comfort, perceived health and energy use. Some significant differences between these two groups of buildings are presented. The very existence of the first set shows that it is possible to design and build office and apartment buildings that are simultaneously energy efficient, healthy and comfortable.

   integrated management; family farms; Kenya
AB The Kakamega forest, located in Western Kenya province, is well known around the world for its biodiversity and it now constitutes a tourist attraction and an experimental area for the international scientific community. But this natural heritage is threatened by strong land pressure in an area where surrounding communities are mainly constituted of farmers of the Luhya ethnic group. In spite of forest protection laws, the removal and the sale of forest products contribute to the sustainability of their systems of production. Thus, the Kakamega forest is at the heart of a conflict between the State and rural communities. our field work was based on a survey of the main stakeholders, farmers and State representatives in order to raise the question of the possibility of joint management. A total number of 90 people were interviewed in eleven villages around the forest as well as in seven markets, thus taking into account all the aforementioned stakeholders. our study shows that the State has established forest protection laws without consulting the farmers. This is why these laws are not recognized by the farmers who continue to draw on forest reserves. indeed, even if the sale of forest products is illegal, it still contributes to between 10% and 85% of the farmers' income. In time, if these activities were to continue, the forest would disappear as in the Maragoli area. The setting up of a new management policy for the Kakamega forest constitutes an essential stake for the agriculture of this area. It is necessary to find alternatives which enable incomes to be generated for the farmers and which contribute to the preservation of the forest. Thus, the development support of farmer associations and the growing awareness of the importance of planting trees in the concessions are initiatives to be encouraged. Moreover, the development of social tourism supplementing an already established ecological tourism would contribute to give new value to the Kakamega forest and would generate new sources of income. The farmers would thus become aware of the international fame of the forest and the interest in preserving it from the point of view of concerted management.

AB The olive tree is a hardy plant but drupes can be heavily damaged by its main pest, the olive fly Bactrocera oleae (Gmelin). Parasitoids of this pest arc well known but keep being poorly active in orchards because of the intensive use of chemicals and due to lack of lansdcape management. The aim is to select adapted flora able to attract and maintain parasitoids, and to stimulate a conservation biocontrol of the olive fly, as well as of the moth or of the black scale. The International Organisation for Biological and integrated Control (IOBC) considers agroecology as the most relevant strategy to focuse on for a sustainable and low-cost agriculture. This paper aims at describing our objectives and the methodology we used in this new experiment on biodiversity.

DT Article
ID MEDICAL-EDUCATION; LEARNING STYLES; OBJECTIVES; ISSUES; GUIDE
AB Purpose: Educational theories provide a guiding basis for coherent medical curriculum development and instruction in a similar way that evidence-based medicine provides a rational basis for medical treatment. The purpose of this review is to provide general organizational, theoretical and educational principles for developing or modifying an anesthesia curriculum.
   Source: This paper draws from the general educational and cognitive psychology literature, the medical educational literature from the period 1996-2006, as well as our experience in renewing the anesthesia clerkship curriculum at McMaster University.
   Principal findings: Successful curriculum development includes the consideration of stakeholder needs, organizational issues, funding and sustainability, curriculum design, implementation and evaluation. Curriculum design includes the development of curricular goals and objectives, determination of the content and its organization, instructional methods and strategies, and assessment of the learners. Curriculum evaluation is used to judge the curriculum's merit and worth. The findings and recommendations from these evaluations feed back into the curriculum development cycle for further curricular improvements or modifications.
   Conclusion: The current medical environment requires a responsive and efficacious curriculum that is able to keep up with its rapid pace of change. By providing a discussion of the educational and theoretical principles which underpin coherent curriculum development, this paper advocates a rational, theory-based approach to curriculum development.

TI Nutrition in primary health care: Using a Delphi process to design new
   interdisciplinary services
SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF DIETETIC PRACTICE AND RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID QUALITY INDICATORS; PATIENT EDUCATION; ADVICE
AB Purpose: A modified Delphi process was used to identify key features of interdisciplinary nutrition services, including provider roles and responsibilities for Ontario Family Health Networks (FHNs), a family physician-based type of primary care.
   Methods: Twenty-three representatives from interested professional organizations, including three FHN demonstration sites, completed a modified Delphi process. Participants reviewed evidence from a systematic literature review, a patient survey, a costing analysis, and key informant interview results before undertaking the Delphi process. Statements describing various options for services were developed at an in-person meeting, which was followed by two rounds of e-mail questionnaires. Teleconference discussions were held between rounds.
   Results: An interdisciplinary model with differing and complementary roles for health care providers emerged from the process. Additional key features addressing screening for nutrition problems, health promotion and disease prevention, team collaboration, planning and evaluation, administrative support, access to care, and medical directives/delegated acts were identified. Under the proposed model, the registered dietitian is the team member responsible for managing all aspects of nutrition services, from needs assessment to program delivery, as well as for supporting all providers' nutrition services.
   Conclusions: The proposed interdisciplinary nutrition services model merits evaluation of cost, effectiveness, applicability, and sustainability in team-based primary care service settings.

AB Defining riparian zones is important because sustainable forestry programs typically include a requirement to protect riparian zones. To help determine whether small first-order headwater streams have a riparian zone, we surveyed vascular plant communities along 15 streams in a managed forest landscape in western Maine, USA. Along each stream we recorded all vascular plant species in 5 m x 50 m quadrats at different lateral distances from the stream bank: 0-5, 13-18, 25-30, and 40-45 m. Trees and shrubs showed no statistical differences among zones in either species richness or community composition. Species richness of herbaceous plants was greater in the 0-5 m zone adjacent to the stream bank than in other zones, and species composition of herbaceous plants was statistically different in the 0-5 m zone relative to more distant zones. Twenty-four herbaceous species (of 129) were determined to be indicators of the riparian plant community. Twenty-three of the 24 indicator species were more likely to occur near the stream, and 1 species was more likely to be found away from the stream (a negative riparian indicator). These results show that a narrow riparian zone exists on small headwater streams that is reflected by the herbaceous plant community.

AB Accurate estimates of forest productivity are required for sustainable forest management. Sixty-five jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) plantations (< 50 years of age) were sampled to develop height growth and variable growth intercept (GI) models for jack pine plantations in northern Ontario, Canada. Based on the residual plots and model-fitting statistics, these models can be recommended for estimating site index (SI) of young (< 40 years) jack pine plantations. To compare SI of plantations with that of natural stands, we used stem-analysis data from 383 plots of natural jack pine stands (aged 50-157 years) from the same geographic region to develop the GI models for natural stands. Also, polymorphic SI curves were developed for young (< 40 years) plantations in northern Ontario. These SI curves were different from those for natural stands. Jack pine plantations had a higher site quality (SI) than did the original natural stands on the similar sites. The SI curves developed from natural stands should not be used to predict growth and yield of jack pine plantations before they are calibrated for jack pine plantations. These GI models will be used to estimate SI for silviculture and forest-management planning.

AB Forest fragmentation is prevalent in regions with high human population density, but also with high biological diversity, such as southwestern China. Predicting potential changes in species composition in native forest ecosystems resulting from forest fragmentation is an important approach in assessing forest ecosystems and sustainable management of forests. The term nonconstituent species is proposed for plant species that occur in a natural landscape but are not native to it. We hypothesized that fragmentation of continuous forests significantly increases both the richness and the size of soil seed banks of nonconstituent species. To test our hypothesis we compared soil seed banks in three small fragments and one large tract of subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forest in Yunnan Province, southwestern China. In total, 249 species were identified in all soil samples from the four sites. Nonconstituent species represented 36.4%-61.5% of the total taxa and 33.8%-59.6% of total germinants from soil samples in the three forest fragments, but only 3.7%-7.9% of total taxa and 7.5%-9.4% of total germinants from soil samples in the continuous forest tract. Both richness and size of soil seed banks of nonconstituent species were greater under forest fragments than under continuous forest. A majority of nonconstituent species were native weeds and annual herbs with wind-dispersed seeds; most were present in soil seed banks but not in aboveground vegetation. We suggest that nonconstituent species in soil seed banks could be used as an indicator species group for assessing human disturbance. If so, the richness and size of soil seed banks of nonconstituent species could play an important role in quantifying disturbance in forests.

AB In Toronto and Montreal, territorial reorganizations modified the arrangements governing regional cooperation, the channels for citizen participation, and the composition of the civic community, all important factors that define the margins local authorities have to control and shape economic and social development. In both cases, these changes brought about a realignment of local civic forces and modified political arrangements at the metropolitan level, leading each city to break from its former path of development.

AB The purpose of the study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a developed drug delivery system containing OK-432 through in vitro and animal study. An OK-432-impregnated polycarbonate/polyurethane stent membrane was used to develop a drug delivery system (DDS) enabling the locoregional release of OK-432. Polyethyleneglycol was used as a detergent and porosity generator. The stability of OK-432 in solvent, releasing kinetics of drug, and cytotoxicity of the DDS were evaluated. OK-432-impregnated DDS was implanted in mice in which a human adenocarcinoma cell line was injected and grown in their back. Flow cytometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were used for quantifying the amount of drug. OK-432 exposed to phosphate-buffered saline and OK-432 exposed to N,N-dimethylacetamide showed similar results on dot graphs and histograms. However, OK-432 exposed to tetrahydrofurane showed different dot graphs and histograms, which means that the antigenicity of the drug was changed. The release rate of OK-432 was maintained at a constant level for 6 weeks. The local delivery of OK-432 was found to have an antitumor effect on a human adenocarcinoma cell line in an animal study, but no effect on this cell line in in vitro cell culture. Histologic examination showed minimal inflammatory reaction in surrounding tissue. Our study shows that local treatment using this OK-432 release system is safe and effective in reducing adenocarcinoma in a mouse model.

AB The sustainable development rule implementation is tested by the application of chemometrics in the field of environmental pollution. A data set consisting of Cd, Pb, Cr, Zn, Cu, Mn, Ni, and Fe content in bottom sediment samples collected in the Odra River (Germany/Poland) is treated using cluster analysis (CA), principal component analysis (PCA), and source apportionment techniques. Cluster analysis clearly shows that pollution on the German bank is higher than on the Polish bank. Two latent factors extracted by PCA explain over 88 % of the total variance of the system, allowing identification of the dominant "semi-natural" and "anthropogenic" pollution sources in the river ecosystem. The complexity of the system is proved by MLR analysis of the absolute principal component scores (APCS). The apportioning clearly shows that Cd, Pb, Cr, Zn and Cu participate in an "anthropogenic" source profile, whereas Fe and Mn are "semi-natural". Multiple regression analysis indicates that for particular elements not described by the model, the amounts vary from 4.2 % (Mn) to 13.1 % (Cr). The element Ni participates to some extent to each source and, in this way, is neither pure "semi-natural" nor pure "anthropogenic". Apportioning indicates that the whole heavy metal pollution in the investigated river reach is 12510.45 mg.kg(-1). The contribution of pollutants originating from "anthropogenic sources" is 9.04 % and from "semi-natural" sources is 86.53 % (C) Versita Warsaw and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB The Gram-negative bacterium Klebsiella planticola represents an interesting host organism for the production of biotechnological products. Microbial processes - especially those of aerobic cultivation - lead to the generation of considerable amounts of biomass, thus lowering the product yield. These are the reasons for studying methods for the recycling of biomass from K. planticola. It will be shown that it is possible to disintegrate the microbial biomass - preferably by means of high pressure homogenization followed by a protease treatment of the resulting slurry of debris - in an efficient way and to recycle at least the soluble part as cultivation medium component. A recycling yield of about 77 % can be achieved. By studying the growth of K. planticola in a cyclic batch cultivation strategy with maximal recycling of the biomass no adverse effects have been observed for a series of more than 9 consecutive cultivation cycles.

AB The growing consciousness for sustainable industrial processes has resulted in industrially developed countries in supporting research efforts toward thorough evaluation of possibilities for improving efficiency of energy intensive separations implying also significant reduction of related carbon dioxide emissions. Being inherently thermodynamically inefficient, distillation, which is by far the most widely utilised and energy intensive separation technology in chemical process industries, has become primary target of energy conservation projects in refining, petrochemical and chemical industries. Improvement is an ongoing activity, replacing still beyond comprehension and a great deal of academic effort is oriented towards augmenting distillation by combining it, where appropriate, with membranes, i.e. pervaporation or vapour permeation, which in conjunction with polymeric membranes proved to be an industrially viable alternative to conventional processes for dehydration of alcohols. Present paper addresses recent developments along this line striving for larger fluxes in alcohol dehydrations by utilising ceramic membranes, with focus on vapour permeation, as well-as the potential for the recovery of organic solvents and reactants forming azeotropes with other organics.

AB Demographic transition has occurred more rapidly in China than inmost developed countries. As the population ages, the growth rate of the working age population has started to decline and the absolute quantity of the working age population will begin to shrink after 2015, which will inevitably result in structural labor shortage. Under the circumstance where comparative advantage is still embodied in its labor-intensive commodities, timely and sufficient supply of a skilled labor force is vital for China to sustain fast economic growth.

TI Defining property rights - A social text on the privatization of
   collective property rights
SO CHINESE SOCIOLOGY AND ANTHROPOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB The definition of property rights, as an interactive process between the parties concerned to establish or change a contract of rights, is without doubt an important social activity in the history of economic life. Ever since the mid 1990s, certain developments from the transformation of township collective enterprises indicate that community collective property rights mainly comprise a property right that is socially contractual instead of market contractual. This kind of social contract is neither some kind of consciously designed system nor a natural expression of social relations. Instead, it is the outcome of relations and specific coordinated actions that represents a harmonious social order Under an imperfect market contract, it might be possible to handle and solve cooperation issues and property rights conflicts within a community in an informal manner and therefore this could play a role in defining and maintaining the order of community property rights. However when there are drastic changes in the institutional environment, such a role for the social contract is very limited. Today, when institutional transformations still need to be backed by administrative force, severely) harmful consequences for sustainable community development would result if the informal rules of social contract were merely replaced with some institutional design that did not take into consideration the extension or replacement of the social contract.

AB A novel silica-based monolithic column possessing diethylenetriaminopropyl ligands for hydrophilic interaction pressurized capillary electrochromatography is described. The preparation of monolithic stationary phase was based on the individual silica matrix forming and subsequent chemical bonding. The triamino groups on the surface of the novel stationary phase generated a sustainable anodic electroosmotic flow under acidic conditions. A variety of neutral and basic analytes were used to evaluate the column performance. The monolithic silica stationary phase exhibited hydrophilic interaction chromatographic behavior toward neutral solutes. For basic tetracycline antibiotics, hydrophilic interaction as well as electrophoretic migration process with the monoliths was observed and peak tailing was avoided.

AB Climate changes occurring during the past several decades in the high elevations of the tropical Andes Mountains have implications for the native plant and animal species, for the ecological integrity of the affected land cover, and for the human-biophysical systems involved. Consequences are also probable for rural inhabitants and their livelihoods, especially for farmers and pastoralists. Biophysical factors have always changed in these mountainous zones; the extent and degree of alteration acting on native and agricultural biodiversity is the concern. Addressing these climate changes is probably within the adaptive capacity of many local land-use systems, unless external socioeconomic or political forces are unsupportive or antagonistic. Suitable programs to provide information, subsidies, or alternatives could be designed. We highlight some of the inherent resiliencies of natural and cultural systems in the Andes and suggest that these systems contain lessons that could be useful elsewhere, in terms of the traits that allow for the sustainable utilization of dynamic and heterogeneous landscapes.
