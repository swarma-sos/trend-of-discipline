TI An evaluation of marketing practices and market orientation in the
   Bulgarian wine industry
SO POST-COMMUNIST ECONOMIES
LA English
DT Article
ID BUSINESS PROFITABILITY; PERFORMANCE
AB Case study analysis reveals that a production orientation rather than a market focus predominantly guides the Bulgarian wine industry. Market orientation has not as yet been effectively implemented owing to internal inertia, ignorance, ambiguous ownership structures and grape procurement problems. Whilst a minority of wineries has become market-oriented, overall the industry has been unable to deliver wines of sufficient and consistent quality, leading to a weakening of the generic Bulgaria brand and a falling share of international wine markets. Most exporters compete in low price categories without a sustainable cost advantage, generating low mark-ups and thus limiting resources for differentiation. Wineries need to develop better collaborative relations with their overseas agents and quality management systems and improve the generation of, and responsiveness to, market intelligence.

AB There is no mandatory requirement for local authorities to provide public toilets. Yet, it is argued, they are a vital component in creating accessible, sustainable and comfortable cities for all. In this paper the reasons for compulsory standards are explained, and the underlying problems of current provision and regulation are investigated. The nature of a spatial toilet strategy in respect of the adequate distribution and location of public toilets is outlined. Changes in the regulatory and organisational aspects of public toilet provision are proposed that would result in a better standard of facilities for twenty-first century needs.

AB A proposal to build an artificial reef has been put together for Newquay in Cornwall. The aim is to enhance surfing conditions for local surfers, to attract visiting surfers and to provide a spectacle for other tourists, particularly during the autumn, winter and spring months. The message nowadays is that engineers should play a wider role in meeting the needs of society, that they must become key practitioners of sustainable development and that they should gain greater recognition for the role they play. It is considered that this proposal goes some way to delivering these goals. This paper discusses the project in the context of sustainable development.

AB Devon can lay claim to being one of England's favourite counties. It possesses an outstanding environment, and also serves as a year-round premier tourism destination. Devon County Council (DCC) is adopting innovative approaches to providing high-quality sustainable tourism. These approaches promote year-round sustainable tourism through initiatives such as a new customer-focused tourism web portal, managing England's first natural World Heritage Site and integrating tourism and economic development in a remote rural area. Devon is also enhancing opportunities for people to enjoy access to the countryside. Linked to DCCs status as a Centre of Excellence for Transport Planning, the county council's sustainable travel initiatives include improving facilities for walking, cycling and leisure travel by public transport. This paper assesses the successes and challenges of strategic approaches to sustainable tourism with particular emphasis on transport networks.

ID CONSTRUCTION; FIRMS; COST
AB The process of innovation often involves the participation of several firms and organisations in a network. This paper improves our understanding of the role of inter-organisational relations in such networks. It assesses how sustainable technologies in the Scottish social housing sector are introduced and diffused. Drawing on detailed interviews, the paper shows that despite policy initiatives by the National Housing Agency to encourage sustainable technologies and processes, a number of factors related to the organisational structure of the construction industry militate against the achievement of this objective. The different aims of the parties involved in the construction chain may not be easily reconciled and traditional approaches to construction may reinforce these differences, hindering efforts to introduce innovation.

ID RADIOTHERAPY TREATMENTS; LINEAR ACCELERATORS; MAINTENANCE COSTS; COBALT

AB Background and purpose: Decisions in planning radiotherapy facilities in countries with limited financial resources require information on economic factors to make provision for sustainability. This study aims at acquiring data on some of these factors involved in delivery of teletherapy in 11 countries of different economic status.
   Patients and methods: Representatives of three European, one African, three Latin American and four Asian countries, were identified from radiation oncology institutions that operated both cobalt and linac teletherapy machines. Productivity data were prospectively collected for the year 2002. A detailed log was recorded for each machine over an arbitrary two-week period. Data on quality assurance (QA), maintenance, the capital costs of each machine, and the source replacement costs for the cobalt units were also recorded.
   Results: Both linear accelerators and cobalt machines treat more than 10,000 fractions per year per machine with 2.5 and 2.3 fields per fraction, respectively. The capital costs of the machines vary considerably, with a factor of more than 10 for linear accelerators. Cobalt sources show a huge variation in price. The median costs of QA and maintenance of a linac was US$41,000 compared to US$6000 for cobalt machines. This results for the economic factors considered in median costs per fraction of US$11.02 for linear accelerators and US$4.87 for cobalt machines. These figures do not include the costs for physicians.
   Conclusions: The variation of the costs per fraction is more due to the result of differences in machine usage and costs of equipment than of national economic status. A treatment fraction on a linac with functionality comparable to cobalt, costs 50% more than cobalt therapy. This project shows that it is possible to collect data on economic factors prospectively as well as retrospectively. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Urban organic farming in Austria with the concept of Selbsternte
   ('self-harvest'): An agronomic and socio-economic analysis

AB In Vienna, consultants, organic farmers and green-minded consumers have developed a new concept of urban organic fanning, called Selbsternte ('self-harvest'). Organic farmers prepare a plot of arable land (the Selbsternte plot) and sow or plant rows composed of 18-23 plant species. In mid-May the plots are divided into subplots that contain 2-6 m of every sown species and are rented to so-called self-harvesters for a period of about 136 days. In 2002 Selbsternte was being practiced at 15 plots in Vienna or in neighboring cities, represented by 861 subplots, with a total area of 68,740 m(2). and managed by 12 organic farmers for 861 registered self-harvesters. At the Roter Berg plot, experimental subplots were established to evaluate yields and the value of the harvested produce, and interviews were conducted with 27 self-harvesters, the eight Selbsternte farmers and one Selbsternte consultant. The experimental subplots were managed in two different ways, namely, 'with low intensity' (LIS) and 'with high intensity' (HIS; meaning additional harrowing, mulching and sowing of additional plants). At the LIS 24.2 h and at the HIS 38.9h of work were invested over 51 days. Monetary investment was US$184 for the LIS and US$259 for the HIS subplots. The total harvest of fresh produce was: 163 kg subplot(-1) for LIS and 208 kg subplot(-1) for HIS subplots. The total value of the harvest at the HIS was US$364 for conventional and US$766 for organic prices. All self-harvesters saw the rental of a subplot and the work as an activity of leisure. More than half of the self-harvesters reported 'trying something new' at their subplots. The most frequently mentioned innovation for them was growing an unknown species. Twenty-five self-harvesters sowed 54 different, additional plant species. The motivating factors in establishing Selbsternte plots, as reported by all the farmers, were, primarily. better relations with consumers and work diversification, and only then were economic factors a consideration. The contribution of Selbsternte to income varied at the farms, being between 0 and 30% of the total farm income. As a main success factor, all of the farmers reported a close relationship between the self-harvesters and the farmers. Selbsternte subplots can be understood as small experimental stations where self-harvesters merge traditional horticultural techniques with urban ideas on permaculture, sustainable land use and participatory farming. Selbsternte has potential value for the improvement of urban agriculture, but also for the development of organic farming in general.

AB Based on citizen demand, Iowa State University (ISU) established the first organic specialist faculty position at a US land grant university in 1997, as a shared appointment in the departments of horticulture and agronomy, with a 70% extension and 30% research split. By 1999, a national survey determined that ISU had reached the upper percentile of organic research, extension and educational activities at land grant universities in the US. This result was attributed to a series of successful Organic Agriculture Focus Groups in 1998, convened to help direct the new organic research and extension program at ISU. Partnerships with the Leopold Center for Sustainable Agriculture and the College of Agriculture facilitated the ISU sustainable agriculture extension leader and organic specialist's participation in an extensive focus group dialogue with a diverse group of farmers (organic and conventional), agribusiness professionals, bankers and consumers in six agricultural communities across Iowa. Focus group responses included the need for organic research at the university level, since the majority of organic farmers (65%) were receiving their information from other organic farmers and non-governmental publications. Paramount in the needs assessment was the establishment of organic research sites across the state to demonstrate the economic and environmental benefits associated with organic farming practices over the long term. Specific outcomes-based extension needs were articulated, which led to the development of an annual schedule of organic workshops, field days and conferences. In 2001, in a survey of 300 farmers to assess the outcomes of the Organic Agriculture Program, all respondents (39% return rate) reported benefiting from an extension organic program. Similar to focus group results, farmers rated workshops and field days as the most likely venue for information dissemination. AS a result of organic farming practices, 90% of respondents reported an increase in soil quality and 67% reported a 6-30% increase in farm income. The success of land grant university organic programs will be dependent upon administrative support, sufficient resources and community involvement in the decision-making process.

AB In a world of limited resources and inexorable pressure to produce food for burgeoning populations, innovative approaches are needed to exploit these resources in a sustainable manner. Phosphorous (P) fertilizers are used extensively throughout the world for commercial crop production, and are a major factor in global food security. Yet, in developing countries, limited or no P fertilizer is used, often because of cost and infrastructure constraints, and this is therefore an impediment to sustainable production. The challenge facing soil scientists involved with soil and fertilizer P research is to produce adequate crops on inadequately fertilized soils in poorer countries and, at the same time, improve the efficiency of P use where excessive amounts are used, thus avoiding negative environmental impacts. Soil-plant fungi, especially arbuscular mycorrhizae (AM), may have a role in solving both horns of the P-use dilemma, since such associations have been shown to vary with plant species, and indeed genotypes within species, and to enhance crop utilization and uptake of P from soils low in soluble or available P. Therefore, as corn is an important feed and food crop in the Mediterranean coastal area of Turkey, we conducted two greenhouse studies to assess the P efficiency of a range of widely grown local corn genotypes and to establish the possible role of mycorrhizae in determining differences in observed P efficiency. The nine genotypes were grown with low to high P fertilizer rates (25-200 mg kg(-1)) and assessed for P efficiency, based on visual observations, dry matter yield, and tissue P concentration. Two efficient and two inefficient genotypes were then grown with and without P fertilizer and added mycorrhizae. The experimental bulk soil had natural mycorrhizal colonization. The genotypes XL 72AA, DK 626 and LG 60, LG 2777 responded differently to both P and mycorrhizal infection. The efficient genotypes were more dependent on added P (twofold yield increase) and mycorrhizae than the inefficient ones. Thus, while mycorrhizal colonization is not a substitute for fertilizer use, it is complementary to it. While difficulties still remain for AM inoculation of crops in the field, more attention to mycorrhizae should be given by plant breeders in the process of crop improvement.

AB We conducted an observational study of parent-child interaction in home activity settings (routines) of families raising young children with developmental disabilities and problem behavior. Our aim was to empirically investigate the construct validity of coercion in typical but unsuccessful family routines. The long-term goal was to develop an expanded ecological unit of analysis that may contribute to sustainable behavioral family intervention. Ten children with autism and/or mental retardation and their families participated. Videotaped observations were conducted in typical but unsuccessful home routines. Parent-child interaction in routines was coded in real time and sequential analyses were conducted to test hypotheses about coercive processes. Following observation, families were interviewed about the social validity.

AB The analysis of relationships among socio-economic activities and the environment is fundamental to plan sustainable development at global and local level. Nevertheless, it is becoming evident that sustainability targets are best pursued within the confines of a local area. In the present work an enterprise input-output (EIO) analysis based on production processes is used to estimate energy and material flows (including pollutants/waste) in the supply chain of a tiles manufacturer located in the tiles Italian industrial district of Sassuolo, in north Italy.
   Tiles manufacturing is a sector of utmost importance for the Italian economy and it requires a great amount of energy. Monitoring energy/water use and pollution levels in this sector is useful to balance positive and negative impacts of energy uses thus providing a measure of resources consumption and environmental impact of the production processes. Also, the model allows to foresee better economy-energy-environment interactions that is possible to implement if alternative production technologies more efficient in terms of energy consumption are adopted.

AB A liquid-xenon-jet laser-plasma source for extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) and soft-x-ray generation has been characterized. Being a source candidate for EUV lithography (EUVL), we especially focus on parameters important for the integration of the source in EUVL systems. The deep-ultraviolet (DUV) out-of-band radiation (lambda=120-400 nm) was quantified, to within a factor of two, using a flying-circus tool together with a transmission-grating spectrograph resulting in a total DUV conversion efficiency (CE) of similar to0.33%/2pisr. The size and the shape of the xenon plasma was investigated using an in-band-only EUV microscope, based on a spherical Mo/Si multilayer mirror and a charge-coupled device detector. Scalability of the source size from 20-270 mum full width at half maximum was shown. The maximum repetition-rate sustainable by the liquid-xenon-jet target was simulated by a double-pulse experiment indicating feasibility of >17 kHz operation. The xenon-ion energy distribution from the plasma was determined in a time-of-flight experiment with a Faraday-cup detector showing the presence of multi-kilo-electron-volt ions. Sputtering of silicon witness plates exposed to the plasma was observed, while a xenon background of >1 mbar was shown to eliminate the sputtering. It is concluded that the source has potential to meet the requirements of future EUVL systems. (C) 2004 American Institute of Physics.

AB Crop rotation and tillage impact microbial C dynamics, which are important for sequestering C to offset global climate change and to promote sustainable crop production. Little information is available for these processes in tropical/subtropical agroecosystems, which cover vast areas of terrestrial ecosystems. Consequently, a study of crop rotation in combination with no tillage (NT) and conventional tillage (CT) systems was conducted on an Oxisol (Typic Haplorthox) in an experiment established in 1976 at Londrina, Brazil. Soil samples were taken at 0-50, 50-100 and 100-200 mm depths in August 1997 and 1998 and evaluated for microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and mineralizable C and N. There were few differences due to crop rotation, however there were significant differences due to tillage. No tillage systems increased total C by 45%, microbial biomass by 83% and MBC:total C ratio by 23% at 0-50 mm depth over CT. C and N mineralization increased 74% with NT compared to CT systems for the 0-200 mm depth. Under NT, the metabolic quotient (CO(2) evolved per unit of MBC) decreased by 32% averaged across soil depths, which suggests CT produced a microbial pool that was more metabolically active than under NT systems. These soil microbial properties were shown to be sensitive indicators of long-term tillage management under tropical conditions. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   RESPONSES
AB On the volcanic soils of the uplands of the French West Indies, banana monocropping has been practised since about 1980, mostly with large inputs of chemicals and replanting every three to five years after ploughing. However, in Guadeloupe less intensive cropping systems with only few added chemicals are still being used. The effects of the intensive practices on the physical, chemical and biological attributes of soils were evaluated on 34 farmed fields, which were selected to include the diverse soils and management practices found in the uplands of South Basse-Terre. Management was classified into four groups to differentiate effects of fertilizers, nematicides and tillage over at least 10 years. The population of the parasitic nematode Radopholus similis was, on average, greater 3 months after the application of nematicides. Thus, the use of nematicides increases the dependency of yield on nematicides. Ploughing decreased soil organic matter in the 0-10 cm layer as well as microbial respiration and earthworm biomass, but increased banana root infestation by R. similis. Ploughing was also associated with a change in soil structure, as revealed by the decrease in soil water content at -1 kPa potential and the increased infiltration rate of water into the 0-10 cm layer. The use of fertilizers has advantages for the maintenance or increase of soil reserves of K. However, due to the decreasing of negative electrical charges in the lower layers of andosols, where pH remains low, the majority of the cations supplied by fertilizers, mainly potassium, are prone to leaching.

AB Soil carbon sequestration could meet at most about one-third of the current yearly increase in atmospheric CO2-carbon, but the duration of the effect would be limited, with significant impacts lasting only 20-50 years. Coupled with this limited duration, increases in population and per-capita energy demand mean that soil carbon sequestration could play only a minor role in closing the difference between predicted and target carbon emissions by 2100. However, if atmospheric CO2 concentrations are to be stabilized at reasonable levels (450-650 ppm), drastic reductions in carbon emissions will be required over the next 20-30 years. Given this, carbon sequestration should form a central role in any portfolio of measures to reduce atmospheric CO2 concentrations over this crucial period, while new energy technologies are developed and implemented. International agreements, such as the Kyoto Protocol, encourage soil carbon sequestration and could be used to formulate soil carbon sequestration polices. Such policies need to take account of other environmental impacts as well as political, economic and societal needs, so that they form part of a raft of measures encouraging sustainable development. Of the carbon sequestration options available, those of a 'win-win' nature, that is, those that increase carbon stocks at the same time as improving other aspects of the environment, and those that protect or enhance existing stocks ('no regrets' implementation) show the greatest promise in meeting these goals.

AB This study examines the relationship between individual-level and the certain neighborhood characteristics with drug use cessation among a sample of long-term inner-city heroin injectors in Baltimore, Maryland. The data were derived from baseline and first follow-up visits of SHIELD, a larger HIV prevention intervention study targeting members of the drug-using community. The survey instrument was interviewer-administered and ascertained sociodemographics, drug use history, and sexual and drug risk behaviors. The data were collected between August 1997 and March 1999. The current study was limited to participants with a median age of 41 years old. 27.5% (n = 53) reported quitting drug use at follow-up. Compared with those who quit, participants who continued (n = 147) were close to five times as likely to buy drugs in the neighborhoods in which they lived, 80% less likely to have used drugs in a shooting gallery in the past 6 months, and close to five times more likely to have used drugs in outside places. Controlling for other factors, enrollment in drug user treatment programs or attending self-help groups were not significantly associated with drug use cessation. This study points to the importance of examining specific environmental factors in relation to quitting drug use. Research is needed to further articulate the types and characteristics of physical environments that are related to and could be intervened in promoting sustainable drug cessation.

TI Modeling the effects of a log export ban in Indonesia
SO SYSTEM DYNAMICS REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB Because enforcement of forestry law has become extremely difficult in Indonesia, a ban on export of logs has been suggested as a means of controlling over-harvest and illegal logging. A model of a log export ban can help us visualize its effects on the forestry sector. The model consists of simplified overviews of: the wood processing sector, demand-price feedback loops, forest standing stock and log availability, log harvest capacity, and log exports. It examines important feedbacks that must be understood if the potential costs and benefits of a log export ban are to be properly considered. Although some scenarios can help reduce log harvests to sustainable levels, others encourage expansion of small domestic milling capacity leading to increased log harvests. Excess domestic milling capacity added during a log export ban may continue to operate even after a log export ban is lifted. For a log export ban to be an effective tool in combating over-harvest and illegal harvest, limits must also be placed on possible increases in domestic milling and logging capacity.

AB In this paper, we consider an autonomous model with impulsive harvest. We investigate the impulsive harvest policies for constant effort harvest and proportional harvest. For different harvest effort function, it is shown that there exists an unique impulsive periodic solution which is semi-stable or globally asymptotically stable. For the latter, the optimal harvest effort that maximizes the sustainable yield per unit time is determined.

AB In this article, we analyze R&D portfolios in environmentally friendly automotive propulsion including alternative fuel options. We argue that at the current stage of development, substitution of conventional car technology by a new automotive propulsion technology may lead to premature lock-in of suboptimal technology. To avoid such lock-in, one should value the variety of current R&D activity that enables organizations to learn from multiple options and to create spillovers between options. We further argue that the existence of technological variety is not a sufficient condition to avoid lock-in. Organizational variety is also required to sustain competition and avoid the dominance of few firms that possibly enforce a suboptimal technology within the sector. To assess whether recent developments in R&D have led to both technological variety and organizational competition, we analyze United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) patents in low-emission vehicles (LEVs) during the period 1980-2001 using entropy statistics. Results show that both technological variety and organizational competition have increased steadily since the early nineties, suggesting that premature lock-in is unlikely to occur. From an environmental policy evaluation perspective, we consider the findings as a positive evaluation of the 1990 Californian Low Emission Vehicle program. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

AB Purpose: To describe the design and development process for an information network that meets the complex needs for information exchange by persons with disabilities. This paper describes the needs assessment and design processes that drove the selection of specific system features, and discusses the range of entities with whom persons with disabilities must exchange information. The authors delineate the design goals and their associated specifications for a network of local resource information that serves the needs of persons with disabilities. A model program has been specified and is currently under development. It will enable users to exchange personal, health, and resource information with service entities and with other members of the disability community who depend on detailed information to support their performance of everyday tasks. As an outcome this activity, a highly portable, replicable, sustainable, scalable, and secure model of consumer-driven information exchange will become available to persons with disabilities and to those who provide services to them. The impact of this system will be amplified when it is launched and replicated in interested communities nationwide.

AB There is a strong demand for innovation of steel-making processes, because the preservation of global-environment, energy and resource saving as well as productivity cost and quality on steel are important issues for sustainable-development of steel industry. Without imparting artificial energy, vortex stirrer using only a gravitational energy is invented and studied. Obtained results are as follows: The refining reagent can be completely sucked into the hot metal through the vortex effect. The tangential velocity decreases inversely with increasing radially the distance from the free surface. The calculated results coincide well with the experimental results.

AB Aiming to contribute to the discussion of how opportunities and threats are put into motion by focusing on the understudied economic factors, this article presents four illustrative accounts from the post-dictatorial experience of environmental contentious politics in Greece, Spain and Portugal, selectively. First, it documents that the incorporation of professional environmental organizations into dominant sustainable development practices in Greece is tied to an economic opportunity spiral that merges from contemporary economic liberalization policies and practices. Secondly, on the basis of protest-event analysis it shows how economic liberalization in Greece acts as a constraint for environmental protests, but an opportunity for anti-privatization ones. Third, via protest-case analysis it documents how economic dependency performs as a spiral of opportunities and constraints for groups tied to different interests in Crete. For example, tourism interest groups appear to opt for environmental protest more often when these interests are threatened by non-tourism-related environmentally damaging activities. Finally, using protest-case analysis the article illustrates how in Southern European local environmental conflict, spirals of economic opportunities and constraints portrayed in state responses to protesters, play a significant role in shaping the dynamics of local environmental contentious politics.

AB Research evidence and pleas that humans are undermining their own survival on a robust and unforgiving planet seem to be falling on deaf ears. The drive for economic and military security remains more powerful than the evidence that both of these objectives are being undermined by environmental damage, social disruption, unjust treatment and forced migration. Yet the signs are growing that environmentally and socially sound futures may be vital prerequisites for economic and military stability. So, at the heart of multi-nationalism, sustainable development is beginning to be recognized as a crucial element in reliable international agreements. The consequence of all this is that environmental science has become highly political, and geographers need to recognize and work within an expanding political process. Examples of new forms of governing via sustainability science for sustainable futures are offered in the latter part of the paper, especially at local government level. The antagonistic pressures of established power and economic hegemony are never far away. Indeed, the confirmation of these established patterns of power still pervades the politics of environmental science. But it is possible that these antagonistic political frameworks are beginning to be transcended by the more influential aspects of sustainability partnerships incorporating new arrangements between government, private capital and civil associations. These partnerships will not be easy to create, for they criss-cross boundaries of familiarity and rules of operation. But geographers can play a critical role in helping to shape them and assess the best circumstances for ensuring their success.

ID BERTHOLLETIA-EXCELSA; EXTRACTION; AMAZON; PERU
AB Sustainable exploitation is widely advocated as a strategy for reconciling economic pressures upon natural habitats with nature conservation. Two recent papers examine different aspects of the sustainability of the nut harvest on wild populations of Brazil nut trees Bertholletia excelsa in Amazonia. Peres et aL find that many populations of the Brazil nut tree lack juvenile trees and are not regenerating. In a socioeconomic study, Escobal and Aldana find that nut-gathering provides insufficient income on its own to support nut-gatherers and that their other income-raising activities damage the forest. The existence of a market for rainforest products is, therefore, not sufficient on its own to prevent habitat destruction or the over-exploitation of the resource and a more sophisticated approach to sustainability is required. Development of a market in ethically traded Brazil nuts might be one solution.

AB Ethiopia is one of the endemic countries for Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) as over 100 000 people are at risk of having the disease. The control of HAT using odour preference of tsetse flies (Glossina morsitans submorsitans) was studied in upper Didessa river valley of Ethiopia. No information exists on the effectiveness of attractants for these species of tsetse flies in Ethiopia. Three attractants and their combinations namely: acetone, octenol, cow urine, acetone + octenol, acetone + octenol + cow urine, were evaluated using biconical and NGU traps for their efficacy as a first step in developing a sustainable community-based HAT control initiative. The biconical traps baited with acetone, octenol or cow urine, or when combined, were more effective in catching G. m. submorsitans than the NGU traps (P < 0.05). However, the NGU traps caught more female tsetse flies than the biconical traps (P < 0.05). The acetone, octenol and cow urine combination was the most effective in attracting tsetse flies in both the biconical and NGU traps. Acetone was the best attractant while octenol was the least effective. Cow urine showed great promise for possible use in community-based HAT control activities, especially urine that has been kept for several days. The use of cow Urine in HAT control in Ethiopia is likely to succeed in the future because of its sustainability.

TI 'Greening the people's home': The formative power of sustainable
   development discourse in Swedish housing
SO URBAN STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB This article analyses what it takes for a new discourse to acquire formative power all the way from the formulation of ideas to the institutionalisation of new practices. Starting from seemingly contradictory propositions in the literature on housing and environmental policy discourses, and combining these with a contextual rational action approach, the empirical analysis traces the fate of the new sustainable development discourse introduced across many policy sectors in Sweden after 1996, including housing. It is found that who introduces new discursive ideas is important for their formative power; discourse introductions by government induce shifts in thoughts and talk across sectors. How this is done is even more important; metaphors and story lines of already institutionalised discourses strengthen formative power. Furthermore, using distributive measures with some strings attached is found to be an effective use of power resources to gain institutionalisation of the new discourse. However, it is found that institutionalised discourses at the local implementing level provide hindrances to formative power reaching all the way to new practices. This is furthermore accentuated by inherent contradictions in the Swedish discourse, as it built on equalising sustainable development with ecological modernisation.

TI Territorial cohesion: Old (French) wine in new bottles?
SO URBAN STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB If finally accepted, the new concept of territorial cohesion could mean a formal planning role for the European Union. The paper traces the French roots of this concept. As other concepts in European integration, it is subject to multiple interpretations. The initial focus has been on regional economic development as such. At present, territorial cohesion is also held to mean ( for example, in the White Paper on European Governance) the co-ordination of policies with an impact on one and the same territory. Originally adhering to a more interventionist approach to spatial planning, the French have learned to factor balanced and sustainable development, concerns of the so-called comprehensive integrated approach, into the equation. Germans, in turn, are seeing sense in the new French focus on 'services of general economic interest'. Experts from both countries agree on the need for a spatial framework for Community policies. Such a framework would look somewhat like the European Spatial Development Perspective, but as part of territorial cohesion policy as a shared responsibility of the Union and its member-states. This would vindicate ideas of the French pioneers of European spatial planning.

TI Management of packaging waste in Poland - development agenda and
   accession to the EU
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT & RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE packaging waste; municipal waste management; recycling rate;
   environmental education; Poland; wmr 677-1
AB In recent years the issue of the Municipal waste in Poland has become increasingly topical, with a considerable rise in the waste generation, much of which can be attributed to a boom in product packaging (mainly plastic). The annual production of plastics packaging has been constantly increasing over the last 20 to 30 years, and now exceeds 3.7 million tons. Due to a lack of processing technologies and poorly developed selective segregation system, packaging waste is still treated as a part of the municipal solid waste (MSW) stream, most of which is landfilled. As a result of Poland's access to the European Union, previous legal regulations governing municipal waste management have been harmonized with those binding on the member countries. One of the main changes, the most revolutionary one, is to make entrepreneurs liable for environmental risks resulting from the introduction of packaging to the market, and for its recycling. In practice, all entrepreneurs are to ensure recovery, and recycling, of used packaging front products introduced to the market at the required level. In recent year, the required recycling levels were fulfilled for all types of materials but mainly by large institutions using grouped and transport packaging waste for that matter. Household packaging gathered in the selective segregation system at the municipalities was practically left alone. This paper is an attempt to describe the system and assess the first year of functioning of the new, revamped system of packaging waste management in Poland. Recommendations are made relating to those features that need to be included in packaging waste management systems in order to maximize their sustainability and harmonization with the EU legal system.

   century: War or peace?
SO WATER INTERNATIONAL

   cooperation; upper-lower riparian; water conflicts
ID MANAGEMENT; RESOURCES
AB The dawn of 21(st) century is a gloomy picture for future generations of India because of increasing water scarcity, which is often fabricating threats of water conflicts. Water is a critical shared resource, and its flow is not restricted to any political boundaries. This necessitates peaceful sharing of water resources both within and among countries. Sharing water is a complex task in most cases in the present era of water conflicts. India, which relished its past fame as water prosperous country, today is moving towards becoming a water stressed nation due to rapid population upsurges and unequal distribution. The demand for water has tripled at a time when the supply of water services is inefficient with socio-economic diversities. Poverty has already become a constant threat for the economy, and water should not add to it. The development policies in India including water resources tend to give primacy to economic cost, disregarding environmental and social cost. This has aggravated tensions further. Considering the existing water-sharing treaties and arrangement with neighbors and suggesting sustainable measures to prevent conflicts and tackle water scarcity is a big challenge for researchers and Indian policy makers today. This is mainly because along with India its neighbors also share the common problems of poverty, population rise, and water stress. A peaceful sharing thus becomes complex many times and hence conflicts in many cases become obvious phenomena.
   This paper thus intends to comprehend in conceptual terms the extent to which the prevalent water sharing among India and its neighbors is peaceful and whether the water scarcity and population rise in India intensifies the chances for water conflicts. In doing this, it tries to start by addressing the water problems. This paper has concentrated much on the Ganges-Brahmaputra Meghna Basins (GBB), which is the thirteenth largest river basin in the world, densely populated, and shared with a number of neighbors. The current debates opposing plans to link rivers of the Ganga basin and Brahmaputra Barak with water deficient regions such as western and southern India in order to handle drought and floods and water scarcity, in a broad sense, develops insecurities in the minds of rational people on the chances of water conflicts.

AB The objective of this study was to obtain detailed information on the long-term weed suppression potential of four winter soil cover types included in an arable crop system managed at various input levels. We used weed seedbank size and composition to assess weed suppression potential. A field experiment was established in 1993 as a split-split-plot design with four replications, including two tillage systems [a conventional system (CS) including ploughing in the cover crops and a low-input system (LIS) including no tillage with surface mulching of the cover crops] in the main plots, three mineral nitrogen fertilization rates for the main crop in the sub-plots and four soil cover types (main crop residue, rye, crimson clover and subterranean clover) in the sub-sub-plots. Seedbank sampling took place in winter 2000/01. The weed seedbank was analysed with the seedling emergence method. Data were analysed using ANOVA and multivariate techniques. Results indicated that the seedbank density in the LIS was about five times higher than in the conventional input system. In the CS, use of a rye cover crop resulted in a lower seedbank density with respect to the crop residue treatment (-25%), whereas in the LIS the subterranean clover cover crop decreased weed seedbank density as compared with the other cover crops and the crop residue treatment (-22% on average). Differences in species composition were mainly related to tillage system. Implications for cover crop management and the development of sustainable cropping systems are discussed.

TI Key deer fawn response to urbanization: is sustainable development

AB Assuming that a finite biosphere can support infinite development seems logically indefensible, yet the concept of sustainable development has become a dominant conservation paradigm. The story of the endangered Florida Key deer (Odocoileus virginianus clavium) appears to support the legitimacy of sustainable development because Key deer numbers have increased 240% since 1970 while at the same time human numbers in their habitat increased nearly 10-fold. Because fawn mortality is considered the primary density-dependent factor regulating cervid populations as they approach K-carrying capacity, we hypothesized that changes in fawn demographics could elucidate the fallacy in assuming that development was sustainable on Big Pine Key. We determined and compared survival and range sizes for Key deer fawns between 1968-1972 (early urban development) and 1998-2002 (post-urban development). Fawn ranges (95% probability area, 149 to 33 ha) and core areas (50% probability area, 25 to 6 ha) decreased during this period of development while 6-month survival increased (0.47 to 0.96). All fawn mortality was due to anthropogenic causes; the positive relationship between fawn survival and development may be a function of isolating fawns from anthropogenic mortality. If this is true, the relationship is not sustainable because as ranges continue to shrink, they eventually will lack sufficient resources to support a fawn.

AB This paper presents an empirical analysis that addresses recent work seeking "win-win-win" scenarios for economic development, poverty reduction and environmental sustainability. I focus on arguments for "productive conservation" in forest frontier regions, namely raising rural incomes while conserving the forest resource base. The analysis examines the impacts of agricultural product and income diversity on agricultural incomes and primary forest cover. The findings show that net of other factors, more diversified farms have higher agricultural incomes, but not significantly less forest cover. This finding is consistent with recent work in other study sites and suggests that initiatives promoting agricultural diversity can at least partially compatibilize production and conservation.

AB The role of tropical forests in sustainable development mechanisms and payments for environmental services is becoming increasingly important. Therefore, there is a greater need for accurate and detailed information about their biophysical characteristics (e.g., Leaf area index-LAI) along different stages of ecological succession. Remote sensing offers the possibility of providing relatively accurate estimations of such biophysical characteristics at a reasonable cost for most regional projects. The objectives of this study are to (1) document the variability of LAI in different stages of secondary growth in a tropical moist forest, (2) estimate LAI from spectral vegetation indices (SVIs), and (3) link LAI to the estimation of other canopy physiognomic characteristics. We found that segregation of LAI measurements by successional stage (early, intermediate, late) contributed to a better definition of the relationship between LAI and the SVIs. In addition, we conclude that the propagation of errors of precision through the SVI formulas must be taken into consideration along with intra-site and radiometric variability when uncertainty terms are calculated. From a linear regression analysis, we found that there is only a minimal difference between the nonparametric Theil-Sen and classical least-squares regressions. We also found that not only does the Lorentzian cumulative transition function describe the relationship between LAI and the SVIs, it also provides an estimate of the range of LAI values to which each index is sensitive.

AB Because of the toxic characteristics of lead, the lead industry is potentially faced with a significant constriction of its future markets if it fails to satisfy regulators and communities that its products will be dealt with in ways that offer the highest level of safety. Legislation banning various lead products in different countries continues to expand, particularly within Europe. Denmark has banned the use of lead compounds. The lead industry is currently coordinating (through the London-based Lead Development Association International) the voluntary lead risk assessment in Europe. This assessment is providing valuable research data associated with the ecotoxicity of lead. Building on this, and addressing the issue of changing and improving practices associated with lead, the green lead project is being created as a product stewardship initiative of the lead industry.

AB Catchments constitute logical units for management of the water cycle. Patterns of development uninformed by sustainability concerns have degraded catchment integrity and associated ecosystem functions, imposing largely unquantified costs. Ecosystem functions are central to sustainable social and economic progress; their protection or restoration may be the only sustainable form of investment in catchments. Despite growing use of catchment functions in some policy areas, a shortfall in awareness and pragmatic tools limits progress with policies and practical tools to support sustainable development in catchments, perpetuating damaging practices. This paper reviews methods of economic valuation of riverine systems. Valuation of ecosystem functions is revealed as particularly pertinent to sustainable development, as an indicator of the benefits of ecological processes to social and economic progress. A range of practical projects, targeted at restoration of riverine habitat in the UK with the intent of improving both river ecology and the social and economic advantages that flow from it, is also reviewed. Emerging principles and themes are discussed in terms of their potential contribution to policies and practices that promote sustainability. Review of these projects highlights the importance of planning at adequately broad scales-spatial, temporal and disciplinary-to identify integrated solutions, and to maximise community 'buy-in' and total benefits. In several cases, economic analyses demonstrate strongly positive benefit-cost ratios stemming from habitat improvement. However, major reform of regulatory and economic instruments is needed to promote sustainable catchment development, since prevalent 'perverse' incentives continue to degrade ecosystem functions. Measures to recognise I and reward ecosystem service as legitimate outputs from agricultural land use constitute a particular priority. There is a need simultaneously to address both 'big picture' structural adjustments and locally-appropriate solutions, from which clear local benefits flow. Pragmatic measures that contribute to systemic outcomes must also be attractive to local decision-makers and land managers, and yield benefits that ensure they are sustained once intervention ceases. Cost need not be a barrier, as current environmentally-damaging subsidies may instead be redirected towards sensitive land use and/or measures to protect biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, particularly where targeted upon habitat of disproportionate importance to functioning of catchments as whole systems. Internalisation of the costs of damage to ecosystem functioning will promote valuation of the natural capital of catchments as a primary resource for social and economic progress.

AB Because occupational hazards of small-scale industries were severe and the occupational health management lagged behind in Shanghai, we selected some districts as experimental units to explore a model of community management and service for the occupational health in small-scale industries for controlling occupational hazards. The results indicated that the model is useful. The features of occupational health in these small-scale industries have been improved markedly. For example, the monitoring rate of occupational hazards increased, the rate for occupational health recording and training also increased, and the knowledge of the occupational health among managers and employees has been also enhanced after implementing the new management model. The practice has shown that it is a low-cost and wide-covered, effective model. The communities may offer the standard, agreeable and low-price occupational health management and service to the small-scale industries which are able to pay the service fee although their economic base is comparatively weak. A solution for protecting the occupational population with relatively high mobility and keeping small-scale industries sustainable development has been reported.

ID SURVEILLANCE
AB The 2.4 billion working people in the developing countries often have to endure employment conditions, which do not meet even basic occupational safety and health (OSH) standards. The lack of work safety, excessive work loads, and occupational physical, chemical and biological exposures result in occupational diseases, injuries and as many as 1.2 million fatalities each year. Furthermore, as little as 15% of workers in the developing countries have access to occupational health and safety services. Some collaboration between the industrialized and developing countries in the field of OSH has been practiced for 30 years but its volume has been modest compared to other sectors of development assistance. The lessons learned from 30 years of experience are that the most important OSH improving factors in developing countries include legal and policy instruments, national OSH programs, infrastructure for OSH implementation, and OSH services. The establishment of OSH expert human resources, centers serving as engines for research, training, as well as information and registration systems can also be considered as key factors in any such collaboration. A convincing government OSH policy, and close cooperation between social partners and the government are also critical factors that guarantee sustainable OSH programs in a developing country over a long-term basis.

AB Many of the cancers common in the Western world, including colon, prostate and breast cancers, are thought to relate to dietary habits. Of the known risk factors, many will act through increasing the probability of mutation. Recognised dietary mutagens include cooked meat compounds, N-nitroso compounds and fungal toxins, while high meat and saturated fat consumption, increasing rates of obesity, and regular consumption of alcohol and tobacco are all dietary trends that could indirectly enhance the probability of mutation. However, there are significant difficulties in implementing and sustaining major dietary changes necessary to reduce the population's intake of dietary mutagens. Dietary antimutagens may provide a means of slowing progression toward cancer, and be more acceptable to the population. Consideration of genetic mechanisms in cancer development suggest several distinct targets for intervention. Strategies that reduce mutagen uptake may be the most simple intervention, and the one least likely to result in undesirable side effects. Certain (but not all) types of dietary fibres appear to reduce mutation through this mechanism, as may certain probiotics and large planar molecules such as chlorophyllin. Antioxidants have been suggested to scavenge free radicals, and prevent their interactions with cellular DNA. Small molecule dietary antioxidants include ascorbic acid, Vitamin E, glutathione, various polyphenols and carotenoids. We found a statistically significant relationship between colon cancer incidence and soil selenium status across different regions of New Zealand. Additionally, a study of middle-aged men suggested that blood selenium levels lower than 100 ng/ml were inadequate for repair or surveillance of oxidative (and other) DNA damage. We suggest that selenium will be an important antimutagen, at least in New Zealand, possibly through antioxidant effects associated with selenium's role in enzymes associated with endogenous repair of DNA damage. Modulation of xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes is well recognised as cancer-protective, and is a property of various flavonoids and a number of sulfur-containing compounds. Many fruits and vegetables contain compounds that will protect against mutation and cancer by several mechanisms. For example, kiwifruit has antioxidant effects and may also affect DNA repair enzymes. Dietary folate may be a key factor in maintenance of methylation status, while enhanced overall levels of vitamins and minerals may retard the development of genomic instability. The combination of each of these factors could provide a sustainable intervention that might usefully delay the development of cancer in New Zealand and other populations. Although there are a range of potentially antimutagenic fruits, vegetables and cereals available to these populations, current intake is generally below the level necessary to protect from dietary or endogenous mutagens. Dietary supplementation may provide an alternative approach. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Therapeutic angiogenesis is the growth of blood vessels from a pre-existing vasculature for clinical applications such as treating myocardial and limb ischemia. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a potent signal transduction molecule that acts specifically on vascular endothelial cells. Encapsulation of VEGF in a polymer matrix not only protects protein against enzymatic degradation in the body, but also allows proteins to be released at a controllable rate into a localized area. In this study, VEGF was encapsulated in calcium alginate beads by the extrusion/external gelation method, and was subsequently released in PBS and in serum media. The objective was to optimize VEGF encapsulation yield and obtain VEGF release at a constant rate from alginate matrices in vitro. The incorporation of low concentrations of VEGF and NaCl can increase encapsulation yield to 97%. The rate of VEGF release from alginate beads was higher in serum than in PBS, which was due to the capacity of the serum in reducing the electrostatic interaction between alginate and VEGF. The presence of CaCl2 in the release supernatant can shield the alginate interaction with VEGF, and a constant release rate of 6 ng/ml/day may be sustained for 14 days. These results suggest that the alginate-VEGF delivery system may be useful in the development of vascular tissue engineering and wound healing applications. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB Forest managers now operate in an information-rich but increasingly challenging environment in which the competing demands of environmental stewardship and sustainable management must counter-balance the demands of increased production and profitability. Management support tools, in particular, decision support systems are essential aids in this operating environment. A dynamic forest growth model, CArbon BALAnce (CABALA), that links carbon, water and nitrogen flows through the atmosphere, trees and soil including soil organic matter is presented here as a central part of a silvicultural decision support system.
   The strong linkage between stand biomass allocation and external environmental conditions make CABALA a model suitable for exploring stand management options and the effects of factors such as frost and drought on growth.
   The model performance is verified extensively using fertiliser, spacing and thinning trials. Predictions of nitrogen mineralisation, light interception, plant water stress, and biomass allocation as well as stand growth and stand leaf area index are tested with observed data.

AB Corporate environmental and resources management has become more strategically oriented when many pollution charges, environmental taxes, and resources conservation fees have been gradually imposing to the industry. The need for explicit consideration and incorporation of varying environmental costs within production-planning program is becoming critical to corporate management. This paper attempts to assess an optimal production-planning program in response to varying environmental costs in an uncertain environment. The optimal production strategy concerning numerous screening of possible production alternatives of dyeing cloth in a textile-dyeing firm in terms of market demand, resources availability, and impact of environmental costs is treated as an integral part of the multi-criteria decision-making framework based on the grey compromise programming approach. It covers not only the regular part of production costs and the direct income from product sales but also the emission/effluent charges and water resource fees reflecting part of the goals for internalization of external cost in a sustainable society. In particular, all the crucial variables in the model are addressed by interval expressions, the same as they are frequently applied in the grey systems theory, in support of a vital uncertainty assessment, which is much better suited for this particular study than other approaches. Research results demonstrate the applicability and significance of such an approach based on a case study. Industry looking for the competitive advantage of environmental management must be aware of the potential benefits from such an integrated production -planning program once the trend of increasing pollution charges, environmental taxes, and resources conservation fees remains.

AB The recent emergence of strains of drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae ( DRSP) is a serious clinical and public health problem. Several interventions have been proposed to limit the further emergence and spread of DRSP, including campaigns for appropriate antibiotic use and the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines. Whether the current epidemic of drug resistance in S. pneumoniae is sustainable or will succumb to current efforts to limit its spread will be decided by an interaction of factors related to the pathogen (i.e., the relative fitness of the resistant strains), to the prescription of antibiotic treatment (i.e., changes in selection pressure), and to the host (i.e., the ability to slow the transmission of DRSP). Much investigation is still needed to better ascertain how maintenance of DRSP strains in the community at large is influenced by each factor and affected by current interventions that are based on these factors.

AB Polyesteramide (PEA) coating resin, synthesized from linseed oil, a sustainable resource, was found to show improved physicomechanical and acid-resistance properties. To further improve these properties in terms of alkali resistance, scratch hardness, and thermal stability and to reduce the baking temperature, we have attempted to incorporate styrene into the polymer backbone through its copolymer with maleic anhydride. The structural elucidation of modified PEA resin (SCPEA) was carried out by FTIR, H-1-NMR, and C-13-NMR spectroscopes. The physico-mechanical and chemical-resistance properties were investigated by standard methods and thermal stability was investigated by thermogravimetric analysis method. A comparative study of these properties of PEA and SCPEA was carried out. It was observed that the SCPEA showed better properties than the reported one. (C) 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB The influence of slow crack growth on the initiation of radial cracks at the lower surfaces of ceramic layers bonded to polymeric substrates is studied, with particular relevance to biomechanical systems, e.g., dental crowns and hip replacement prostheses. Critical loads are measured as a function of loading rate (dynamic fatigue) for model bilayers fabricated by epoxy-bonding selected clinical ceramics to polycarbonate bases. Radial crack initiation is observed in situ by viewing from below the transparent base during loading. Declines in the critical loads with diminishing load rate are consistent with slow crack growth of intrinsic flaws prior to radial crack pop in. A simple fracture mechanics relation incorporating a crack velocity function is used to analyze the data. Extrapolation beyond the data range enables long-lifetime (10 yr) estimates of sustainable loads. The procedure provides a basis for ranking ceramic types, and in particular for eliminating vulnerable candidate materials, for use in biomechanical systems. While slow crack growth is an important factor in failure, other mechanisms could operate in concert and even dominate under severe testing conditions, especially under cyclic loading.

AB Seven dynamic aspects of sustainability-resources-were described and monitored thoroughly in a small model conununity-Hagaby-in west Uppsala, Sweden. The residents' use of local and distant physical resources, such as heat, electricity, fuel and clean water or production of solid waste and wastewater in the model project were lower than the Swedish average, while the utilisation of local material resources like soil and ground water was higher. Economic resources like houses, equipment. greenery and technical infrastructure were administered and used to minimise costs for construction, maintenance, rents and fees. Social and organisational resources were outlined and managed to facilitate relations between residents and between local professionals in the area. Other goals in the planning of Hagaby, were to facilitate an efficient local as well as distant mobility (transportation and communication) and to organise space for social contact as well as for privacy for individuals and households. Biological, cultural and aesthetic resources were important indirect factors affecting the inhabitants' feeling of rootedness and their sense of place. All seven resources were managed in its site context to optimise the sustainability of the unique local community.
   The results from Hagaby were also compared with preliminary data from a new research project investigating sustainability conditions in three common Swedish townscape types in four municipalities. Preliminary results showed that sustainability strengths and weaknesses in several cases indeed differ quantitatively and qualitatively between different typical parts of the city. The results support that the dynamic resource model presented in this paper, should be helpful in establishing place and situation adapted sustainability strategies in any type of Swedish local community.

AB There is now substantial literature describing the importance of home gardens for a variety of quality of life variables such as avoidance of stress, recreation and personal and social identity. From a water resource management perspective it is reasonable to hypothesise that those households that gain the most personal benefits from their gardens will use more water. Consideration of the relationship between quality of life and external water use needs to be made if policies in relation to demand management, supply reliability and restrictions are to reflect community values adequately. In this study, estimates were made of external water use, the total water use outside home (e.g. on lawns, gardens, or swimming pools) for 397 households in detached housing in Perth, WA. Measurements were made of a variety of socio-demographic variables which may affect water use. These included income, block size, swimming pool ownership and so on. In addition five latent attitudinal or quality of life variables were measured. These were the importance of garden and natural space for personal lifestyle satisfaction, interest in gardening, attitudes towards the garden as a source of recreation, attitudes to water conservation and a social desirability scale. External water use was modelled using structural equations with the latent variables. The expected socio-demographic variables such as block size or swimming pool ownership were found to influence water use. Lifestyle, garden interest and C, garden recreation activities were found to be related but all had a direct influence on external water use. Attitudes towards water conservation unlike previous studies also directly affected external usage. It appeared that the interaction between attitudinal and socio-demographic influences were minimal on external water use. The significance of these findings for evaluating the performance of water utilities on the social dimension of sustainability is discussed. Finally, the need for appropriate specificity in attitudinal and water use measurement in demand prediction studies is highlighted. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB International efforts to preserve the natural environment are mainly concerned with large, bio-diverse and relatively untouched ecosystems or with individual animal or vegetal species, either endangered or threatened with extinction. Much less attention is being paid to that type of nature close to where people live and work, to small-scale green areas in cities and to their benefits to people. Increasing empirical evidence, however, indicates that the presence of natural areas contributes to the quality of life in many ways. Besides many environmental and ecological services, urban nature provides important social and psychological benefits to human societies, which enrich human life with meanings and emotions. The main concern of this paper is to address the importance of urban nature for citizens' well being and for the sustainability of the city they inhabit. Some results of a survey conducted among visitors of an urban park in Amsterdam (The Netherlands) are presented and discussed. The issues investigated concern people's motives for urban nature, the emotional dimension involved in the experience of nature and its importance for people's general well being. Results confirm that the experience of nature in urban environment is source of positive feelings and beneficial services, which fulfill important immaterial and non-consumptive human needs. Implications for the sustainability of the city will be analyzed and discussed. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID DESIGN
AB The need to reduce pollutant emissions and utilise the world's available energy resources more efficiently has led to increased attention towards e.g. fuel cells, but also to other alternative energy solutions. In order to further understand and evaluate the prerequisites for sustainable and energy-saving systems, ABB and Fortum have equipped an environmental information centre, located in Hammarby Sjostad, Stockholm, Sweden, with an alternative energy system. The system is being used to demonstrate and evaluate how a system based on fuel cells and solar cells can function as a complement to existing electricity and heat production. The stationary energy system is situated on the top level of a three-floor glass building and is open to the public. The alternative energy system consists of a fuel cell system, a photovoltaic (PV) cell array, an electrolyser, hydrogen storage tanks, a biogas burner, dc/ac inverters, heat exchangers and an accumulator tank. The fuel cell system includes a reformer and a polymer electrolyte fuel cell (PEFC) with a maximum rated electrical output of 4 kW(el) and a maximum thermal output of 6.5 kW(th). The fuel cell stack can be operated with reformed biogas, or directly using hydrogen produced by the electrolyser. The cell stack in the electrolyser consists of proton exchange membrane (PEM) cells. To evaluate different automatic control strategies for the system, a simplified dynamic model has been developed in MATLAB Simulink. The model based on measurement data taken from the actual system. The evaluation is based on demand curves, investment costs, electricity prices and irradiation. Evaluation criteria included in the model are electrical and total efficiencies as well as economic parameters. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A field comparison of baited remote underwater video stations (BRUVS) and prawn (shrimp) trawls was made to assess the sampling options for describing patterns of fish biodiversity in the lagoonal waters of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. Replicated comparisons were made during the day and night on trawl grounds with different biophysical characteristics. Each trawl was made close and parallel to a long-shore set of five BRUVS set at regular intervals along one nautical mile. For each species, the sum of the maximum number of fish sighted on BRUVS at any one time (SigmaMaxN(1, ..., 5)) was compared with the number of fish caught in trawls (N).
   The two techniques recorded significantly different components of the fish fauna on the trawl grounds. Trawls caught mainly small (less than or equal to 300 mm), sedentary or cryptic, demersal species-such as flatfishes, apogonids, synodontids, triglids and callionymids. The BRUVS recorded more larger, mobile species from a much wider size range of families, including large elasmobranchs, more fusiform pelagic species (such as carangids and scombrids), and numerous eels. Species accumulation curves were parallel and very similar in shape for both techniques, but were separated by about 11 extra species in trawls. Fifty-two species in 17 families were caught only in trawls and 38 species in 15 families were recorded only by BRUVS. The occurrence of 38 small mobile species in 21 families was common to both techniques, but most of these showed marked differences in relative abundance. Trawls recorded higher species richness at all sites, and at night, but the average number of species and individuals recorded per transect were only about 26% and 19% lower for the BRUVS. The BRUVS consistently recorded more species during the day than trawls, and are limited most by water clarity. Multivariate analyses showed that both techniques indicated the presence of six fish assemblages based on day and night in three locations, despite sampling quite different components of the fauna. The six assemblages accounted for 78.9% of the variation in the BRUVS data compared to 68.9% of the variation in the trawl data, and there was a lower error rate in discriminating the six assemblages in the BRUVS data.
   BRUVS are non-extractive and can be used on complex topographies and in sensitive habitats in most or all zones of the Marine Park, but models of bait plumes are needed to convert fish sightings to density estimates. They may have a particular role in studies of larger, rarer elasmobranchs and teleosts of special conservation interest. Trawls can be used in any level of water clarity and provide direct estimates of fish density, particularly those smaller teleosts most vulnerable to the effects of trawling. The complementary use of prawn trawls and BRUVS would enable a more comprehensive assessment of teleost and elasmobranch diversity in the variety of inter-reef seabed topographies and management zones comprising the Marine Park.

AB This paper discusses the integration of material flux analysis and agent analysis as the basis for a transition towards improved regional wood management in Appenzell Ausserrhoden (AR), a small Swiss canton located in the Pre-Alps of Switzerland. We present a wood flow analysis for forests, wood processing industries and consumption in AR, accounting for different wood products. We find that the forest is currently significantly underutilized although there are sizeable imports of wood and fuel to this small region. The underutilization of the forest contributes to a skewed age distribution, jeopardizing long-term sustainable development of the forest, as the fulfillment of its protective and production function are likely to be at risk. The wood resources, however, are capable of satisfying current wood demand among the population of AR and wood could even be exported. Under-utilization has two main causes: first, wood prices are so low that harvesting trees is a money-losing proposition; second, consumer wood demand and the current supply from forest owners are not aligned. Furthermore, cultural values, lifestyle trends and traditions make an alignment of supply and demand difficult. Consensus and strategy building with the relevant stakeholders on the basis of the results obtained from the wood flow analysis and agent analysis is a reasonable next step to take. We conclude that wood flow analysis combined with agent analysis provide a useful and straightforward tool to be used as the basis of a transition process towards improved regional wood flows, which in turn should contribute to sustainable forest management.

AB A field experiment was conducted for 10 years (1989-1990 to 1998-1999) to study the effect of long-term irrigation with sodic and saline-sodic waters in the presence and absence of amendments on soil properties and their influence on growth, yield and quality of sugarcane on a well-drained sandy loam Typic Ustochrept soil. Irrigation water treatments included: a good quality water (CW), sodic water (RSC, 10 me l(-1)) and saline-sodic water (RSC, 10 me l(-1) and EC, 3 dS m(-1)). Two amendments viz. FYM at 20 t ha(-1) every year and gypsum applied with each irrigation to neutralize 7.5 me l(-1) of RSC, were superimposed on these water treatments. Long-term irrigation with sodic and saline-sodic waters increased pH, EC and ESP of the soils. The harmful effects were relatively severe under saline-sodic irrigation. The cane yield and yield contributing parameters (cane height, average number of millable canes and cane thickness) decreased significantly over the years under sodic and saline-sodic irrigations. The beneficial effect of gypsum was more pronounced in increasing cane yield under sodic (30%) compared to saline-sodic irrigation (13%). On the other hand, FYM was more effective under saline-sodic (38%) than under sodic water irrigation (23%). The significant complimentary effects of both the amendments applied together were observed only under sodic irrigation. Under saline-sodic irrigation, both the amendments applied together were at par with FYM treatment but significantly better than the gypsum treatment. The percent commercial cane sugar (% CCS) significantly decreased under these treatments and had the lowest values under saline-sodic irrigation in most years. These irrigations also significantly increased the EC and Na, Cl and SO4 content of the juice. The harmful effects of sodic and saline-sodic irrigation became severe in case of sugar yield over the years. Compared to 12.2 t ha(-1) under CW irrigation, sugar yield was 10.2 and 8.3 t ha(-1) after the first year and it further decreased at 0.29 and 0.18 t ha(-1) per year under sodic and saline-sodic irrigation, respectively. The beneficial effects of the amendments in improving % CCS and sugar yield were similar to those observed in case of cane yield. Complimentary effects of these amendments in improving sugar yield were observed under sodic irrigation (12.3 t ha(-1)). In case of saline-sodic irrigation, sugar yield under the FYM treatment (10.8 t ha(-1)) was at par with gypsum plus the FYM treatment but was significantly higher than under the gypsum treatment (9.0 t ha(-1)). The results of the study suggest that sustainable cane and sugar yields with good quality juice can be obtained by applying gypsum/FYM or both under sodic and only FYM under saline-sodic water irrigation.

AB The production of dry matter and grain depends on the ability of crops to capture resources. On an annual basis, farming systems centred on single crops waste large proportions of key inputs including incoming solar radiation and rainfall. Intensive farming involving multiple crops per year could improve resource capture and productivity. Resource productivity is defined as the ratio between output (biomass or grain yield) and annual input of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) or rainfall. This paper tested the hypotheses that (i) wheat-soybean (Triticum aestivum L. and Glycine max (L.) Merr., respectively) double cropping increases resource productivity in relation to single crops through improved capture and efficiency in the use of resources, and (ii) the link between radiation- (RUE) and water-use efficiency (WUE) previously established for sole crops remain when scaling up to double cropping.
   Sequential and relay wheat-soybean double crops were compared with sole crops during 2 years in the south-eastern Pampas of Argentina. Water and radiation productivity (RP) were analysed as the product between proportion of resources captured by crops and the efficiency in the use of resources to produce plant material, i.e. RUE, and WUE.
   Responses of resource productivity to cropping strategy were generally similar for dry matter and grain yield. Differences between sequential and relay wheat-soybean double crops were minor. On an annual basis (i.e. from I May to 30 April), both water and RP were higher in double crops than in sole crops. This was largely related to improved capture of resources. On a seasonal basis (i.e. from sowing to physiological maturity), however, double and sole crops had similar water productivity whereas RP was lower for double crops, intermediate for soybean and higher for wheat. The impact of double cropping on resource capture was much larger for water than for radiation. The fraction of annual precipitation captured by crops increased from 0.26 to 0.51 in sole crops to 0.53 to 0.71 in double crops, whereas the capture of annual PAR increased from 0.24 to 0.31 to 0.38 to 0.44. The differential impact of double cropping on the capture of resources reflects the difference between storable (water) and non-storable resources (radiation). In agreement with our proposition, water use efficiency was closely associated with radiation use efficiency. For our conditions, further improvement in farming systems based on multiple cropping should target practices to enhance capture of radiation. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Strategic leadership of ethical behavior in business
SO ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT EXECUTIVE
LA English
DT Article
AB The strategic leadership of ethical behavior in business can no longer be ignored. Executives must accept the fact that the moral impact of their leadership presence and behaviors will rarely, if ever. be neutral. In the leadership capacity, executives have great power to shift the ethics mindfulness of organizational members in positive as well as negative directions. Rather than being left to chance, this power to serve as ethics leaders must be used to establish a social context within which positive self-regulation of ethical behavior becomes a clear and compelling organizational norm and in which people act ethically as a matter of routine. This article frames the responsibility for strategic leadership of ethical behavior on three premises: (1) It must be done-a stakeholder analysis of the total costs of ethical failures confirms the urgency for ethics change; (2) It can be done-exemplars show that a compelling majority of an organization's membership can be influenced to make ethical choices; (3) It is sustainable-integrity programs help build and confirm corporate cultures in which principled actions and ethics norms predominate.

AB It has long been recognized that the cement industry is a major contributor to global CO2 emissions and that resorting to high-volume replacement of portland cement with supplementary cementitious materials is the most promising measure for the industry to meet its environmental obligations. Indeed, such a practice offers immense benefits not only with regard to CO2 emission savings, but it also increases the durability of concrete infrastructure and uses large amounts of waste materials. Forecasting how such a practice will affect cement industry CO2 emissions in the future, however is often based on qualitative estimates that are linear and do not account for the system complexity of the problem. Clearly, there is a lack of a reliable policy-making/testing tool in this area that allows us to answer "what if''-type questions. This research is a pioneering application of System Dynamics modeling, a feedback-based, object-oriented modeling paradigm, to create a novel rational model that departs from current approaches used in modeling CO2 emissions of cement production. The proposed model allows the user to test a wide variety of scenarios; its flexible architecture permits coupling it with general economic or service life models, and its modular nature allows expanding its boundaries to include other facets of the holistic CO2 emissions problem.

AB Sustainability has become a central issue in the agricultural sector, both for researchers, producers and policy-makers. The two main objectives of this paper are: (1) to present an holistically designed ecological-economic model to evaluate farm and field-level environmental-economic tradeoffs with special reference to multi-objective policy-making and (2) to evaluate the impact of the Agenda 2000 reform on sustainability of organic farming. The model was implemented for the case of organic dairy farming in northern Tuscany (Italy). Minor differences were found between the environmental and technical results of the model under the MacSharry and Agenda 2000 reforms. However, gross margins under the Agenda 2000 regulations were considerably higher. The spatial detail of the model proved particularly useful in the evaluation of the impact of environmental sustainability thresholds. Sensitivity analysis indicated the weak environmental points of the farming system (in this case mainly soil erosion) and the feasible levels of the various environmental aspects and their associated socio-economic costs. The application of the model for alternative policy scenarios provided insights into ways in which the cost economic efficiency of the Agenda 2000 agri-environment support scheme could be improved. The paper concludes with suggestions for further model research to contribute to the design of cost-efficient agri-environment payment schemes. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Fresh water is becoming scarce not only in and and drought prone areas but also in regions where rainfall is abundant. Effective management of water for agricultural production in water scarcity regions therefore requires the use of innovative and sustainable approaches. The reported study was undertaken to determine an efficient strategy for management of irrigated maize under water stressed conditions, in a sub-tropical region. Field experiments were conducted on the crop over a period of 3 years with five different irrigation treatments. Layer-wise soil moisture status was continuously monitored to determine the crop water extraction pattern and hence the optimum irrigation management depth. Five irrigation treatments were maintained based on predefined levels of maximum allowable depletion (MAD) of available soil water. The treatments were 10% (T-1), 30% (T-2),45% (T-3), 60% (T-4) and 75% (T-5) maximum allowable depletion of available soil water. CERES-Maize growth simulation model was calibrated and validated for further use. The depth and time variation of soil moisture were assessed by measuring the soil moisture periodically in 15-30 cm, 30-45 cm, 45-60 cm, 60-90 cm and 90-120 cm soil profiles with a neutron probe; while the soil moisture in 0-15 cm soil profile was determined by gravimetric method. It was observed that the plants extracted most of the soil moisture from 0-45 cm soil layer. Therefore, it is recommended that only 0-45 cm soil profile be considered for scheduling of irrigation in case of maize, grown in sandy loam soil in the sub-tropical regions. Measured and simulated results revealed that under water scarcity condition, plant extractable soil water depletion of more than 45% of ASW must be avoided even during non-critical growth stages to obtain high water use efficiency and net return. The calibrated CERES-Maize Model was found to be quite efficient in simulation of yield parameters and layer-wise soil moisture extraction pattern. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In the lower Indus Basin of Pakistan, where rainfall is low and water use is high, more than 350 scavenger wells were installed under the left bank outfall drain stage-1 (LBOD- 1) with a capital cost of US$ 12.75 million to provide drainage and to recover fresh groundwater mainly for irrigation purposes. This paper highlights the environmental issues in the pumping and disposal of saline groundwater for sustainability of scavenger wells. In this paper, the hydraulic performance of two scavenger wells (PSW1A and PSW2) representing different hydro-geological conditions in the lower Indus Basin was evaluated using two numerical models (MODFLOW and MT3D), and changes in the operational strategies of such wells for the concerned hydro-geological conditions have been recommended.

AB Ansai is a county characterized by hilly loess relief that experiences all problems typical to the Loess Plateau of northern China, such as population pressure, soil loss, over-use of marginal lands, and poverty and food insecurity problems. Alleviation of these problems needs an integrated consideration of different objectives. To learn about the potentials and limitations of agricultural development and conflicts between objectives, this study conducted a systematic and trade-off analysis of different policy objectives, based on a land use optimization model (linear programming) integrating biophysical, agro-technical and socio-economic information. The results can serve two purposes, i.e., to reveal the solution space for each of the objectives and to analyze trade-off relationships between pairs of objectives. The information also forms the basis for further scenario analysis in which several objectives are considered simultaneously.
   The study results show that from an agro-technical point of view large opportunities exist to reduce the serious soil losses induced by crop cultivation on marginal lands, while still achieving food self-sufficiency. This can be achieved by reducing the area of marginal farmlands and efficient use of the most suitable land units, or/and by use of soil conservation measures (terracing and agro-techniques of furrow-ridging, residue mulching and rotational cropping with alfalfa). In general, achieving soil loss control was largely in agreement with improving production efficiency. However, the goal for maintenance of employment in agriculture strongly conflicted with environmental and productivity objectives. An increase of employment was associated with a distinct increase of (marginal) land area to be used for cropping, soil loss, total production cost and use of agro-chemicals, but with an almost linear decrease of labor productivity. The trade-off results also indicated that for a specific objective, a small deviation from its optimum value could result in a great improvement for most other objectives. These so-called nearly optimum solutions could be appealing alternatives to stakeholders. The study suggests that to promote a sustainable development in Ansai, policies are needed that stimulate efficient resource use and create opportunities for off-farm employment and income.

AB During the 20th century, farmers around the world replaced legume rotations and other traditional sources of nitrogen (N) fertility with synthetic N fertilizers. A sizable percentage of the human population now depends on synthetic N fertilizers for survival. In recent decades, N fertilizers have been linked to numerous environmental hazards including marine eutrophication, global warming, groundwater contamination, and stratospheric ozone destruction. Some researchers suggest that legumes, which can support biological NZ fixation, offer a more environmentally sound and sustainable source of N to cropping systems. This perspective is countered by researchers who argue that, (1) legume-derived N has equally negative environmental impacts as the N derived from synthetic fertilizers, and (2) the human population now exceeds the carrying capacity of agricultural systems that depend on legumes for N inputs. In this review, we compare the sustainability of obtaining N from legume versus industrial sources in terms of ecological integrity, energetics and food security. We conclude that obtaining N from legumes is potentially more sustainable than from industrial sources. We further suggest that while some countries are fundamentally dependent on synthetic N for food production, many countries have the capacity to greatly reduce or eliminate dependence on synthetic N through adoption of less meat-intensive diets, and reduction of food waste.

AB Currently, there is a major concern regarding agri-environmental issues. Farmers are viewed not only as food suppliers but also as the custodians of the countryside. This role of farmers has been officially acknowledged in the EU Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) through a number of regulations that enforce agri-environment schemes and cross-compliance. However, under some circumstances these regulations have proved to be ineffective. Organic farming can play an important role for agri-environment schemes. The main aim of this study is to show the relevance of the assessment of the environmental performance of conventional and organic farming systems for the development of efficient agri-environment schemes. An holistically designed ecological-economic model was applied under current EU regulations and different policy scenarios. The model is based on a standard linear programming farm model extended with emission and evaluation figures retrieved from ecological models. Spatial aspects, such as pedo-climatic conditions, were included in the model. The approach was implemented for the case of northern Tuscany. Results indicated that organic farming systems (OFSs) were environmentally more beneficial than conventional farming systems (CFSs) and that current CAP market and income support schemes gave cause for an intensification of farm production and for an increase of environmental harm. They also showed that conventional farmers willing to produce environmental performances comparable to those of organic agriculture or to comply with environmental sustainability thresholds (ESTs) incur opportunity costs due to the need of application of organic crop management and/or extensification of the crop plan. Conclusions were drawn on the environmental performances of OFSs and CFSs, the impact of EU policies on sustainability of agriculture, opportunity costs of environmental benefits and on the practical use of the modelling framework for policy design.

AB Recent emphasis on species diversification in sustainable agriculture highlights the importance of elucidating how species number and diversity affect soil nutrient processes. Effects of weed species numbers on soil carbon, nitrogen and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) were studied in field experiments during 1998-2001 in a subtropical citrus orchard situated at Changshan County (28 degrees 54'N, 118 degrees 30'E) in the southwestern Zhejiang Province, PR China. Twelve native weed species were selected for the experiment based on their characteristics of nitrogen fixation, root system type and phenological period. Six kinds of weed communities (groups) of either 0, 1, 2, 4, 8 or 12 weed species were formed by selectively removing the unwanted species. After establishing each artificial weed communities, plant biomass, plant nitrogen, soil organic matter, soil total N, soil microbial C and N, number of AMF spore were measured in May and October 1999-2001. The results demonstrated a strong influence of weed communities with different species numbers on soil N, C and soil microbes because of weed biomass that was returned to soil. Species numbers increasing from 0 to 4 and 8 to 12 enhanced plant biomass significantly that directly affected soil C and N. Microbial biomass C and N increased significantly with species numbers increasing from 0 to 12 in the early growing season but not in the late growing season possibly due to the competition for N and other nutrients between plants and microbes. Results implied that in a community with a few plant species, increasing species numbers plays a determining role in soil C and N by increasing plant biomass, in a species rich community, however species characteristics are important for determining soil C and N. The numbers of AMF spores increased significantly with increasing species number, which may contribute to the mycorrhizal colonization of cultivated plants. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

AB In areas where fallow agriculture is practiced under increasing pressure on land, reduced soil fertility may derive not only from shorter fallow periods, but also from changes in floristic composition and structure in regenerating forest patches. The possible effects of these latter on soil fertility and subsequent crop yields has been largely neglected. The consequences of an observed shift from Quercus- (oak) to Pinus- (pine) dominated fallows on crop yields was investigated in the mountains of Chiapas, southern Mexico. Three successive crops, Zea mays L. var. praecox (popcorn), Triticum aestivum L. (common bread wheat), and a local landrace of Zea mays L. cv. "oloton amarillo" were grown in 210 pots. Growth substrates obtained from forest microsites with similar climate, fallow period and soil type, but with different combinations of litter to mineral soil ratio (LR = grams of litter/grams of both mineral soil and litter) and pine litter dominance (PLD = grams of pine litter/grams of total litter), were used, with or without litter burning. Organic matter, total N, extractable phosphorus, pH, CEC, and soil C/N ratio were analyzed in 144 randomly chosen pots. Multiple regression analysis was used to assess the relative importance of LR, PLD, and burning or non-burning of litterfall on aboveground dry matter production and on soil variables. Increase in LR generally resulted in a positive effect on soil variables and crop yields; litter burning had a statistically significant effect (P < 0.01), but its favorable influence on yield was rather small. Pine dominance, as reflected in PLD, modified soil variables and reduced crop yields; its effects were relatively stronger when burning was prevented and when accumulated litter was low. Possible consequences of human-induced pine dominance on the soil resource base and on the dynamics of fallow agriculture are discussed. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

AB Agroforestry systems are often mentioned as a type of sustainable agriculture that is appropriate for the edapho-climatic conditions of Amazonia. However, long-term studies on the sustainability of this land use do not exist. This study evaluates the soil fertility in smallholder agroforestry systems in Western Amazonia, and compares the fertility of land under agroforestry with the fertility of neighboring land under pasture and native forest. Smallholdings located in Nova California, Rondonia, Brazil, were selected, with two different soil types. Soil pH, organic C, P, K, Ca, Mg and Al were determined. The soils of the agroforestry system maintained their improved chemical characteristics that originated in the burn, especially with respect to increased levels of exchangeable Ca and Mg and reduction of exchangeable Al, while maintaining stable levels of organic C, even when compared to adjacent primary forest soils. However, in the agroforestry system K and P fell to extremely low levels, below those considered to be critical for Amazonian soils. This reduction can reasonably be attributed to nutrient exports by consecutive harvests of cupuassu (Theobroma grandiflorum, Sterculiaceae) and pejibaye (Bactris gasipaes, Palmae) fruits. These nutrients can limit sustainable fruit yields in the agroforestry systems. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Worldwide, fuelwood demands, soil and groundwater contamination, and agriculture's impact on nature are growing concerns. Fast growing trees in short rotation woody crop (SRWC) systems may increasingly meet societal needs ranging from renewable energy to environmental mitigation and remediation. Phytoremediation, the use of plants for environmental cleanup, systems utilizing SRWCs have potential to remediate contaminated soil and groundwater. Non-hyperaccumulating, i.e., relatively low contaminant concentrating, species such as eucalypts (Eucalypts spp.), poplars (Populus spp.), and willows (Salix spp.) may phytoremediate while providing revenue from fuelwood and other timber products. Effective phytoremediation of contaminated sites by SRWCs depends on tree-contaminant interactions and on tree growth as influenced by silvicultural, genetic, and environmental factors. Locally adapted trees are essential for phytoremediation success. Among the different agroforestry practices, riparian buffers have the greatest opportunity for realizing the SRWC and phytoremediation potentials of fast growing trees. Agroforestry that combines SRWC and phytoremediation could be an emerging holistic approach for sustainable energy, agricultural development, and environmental mitigation globally.

AB Windbreaks are a major component of successful agricultural systems throughout the world. The focus of this chapter is on temperate-zone, commercial, agricultural systems in North America, where windbreaks contribute to both producer profitability and environmental quality by increasing crop production while simultaneously reducing the level of off-farm inputs. They help control erosion and blowing snow, improve animal health and survival under winter conditions, reduce energy consumption of the farmstead unit, and enhance habitat diversity, providing refuges for predatory birds and insects. On a larger landscape scale windbreaks provide habitat for various types of wildlife and have the potential to contribute significant benefits to the carbon balance equation, easing the economic burdens associated with climate change. For a windbreak to function properly, it must be designed with the needs of the landowner in mind. The ability of a windbreak to meet a specific need is determined by its structure: both external structure, width, height, shape, and orientation as well as the internal structure; the amount and arrangement of the branches, leaves, and stems of the trees or shrubs in the windbreak. In response to windbreak structure, wind flow in the vicinity of a windbreak is altered and the microclimate in sheltered areas is changed; temperatures tend to be slightly higher and evaporation is reduced. These types of changes in microclimate can be utilized to enhance agricultural sustainability and profitability. While specific mechanisms of the shelter response remain unclear and are topics for further research, the two biggest challenges we face are: developing a better understanding of why producers are reluctant to adopt windbreak technology and defining the role of woody plants in the agricultural landscape.

AB Forest gardens are reconstructed natural forests, in which wild and cultivated plants coexist, such that the structural characteristics and ecological processes of natural forests are preserved, although the species composition has been adapted to suit human needs. These agroforests include a range of modified and transformed forests, and form an integral part of local land-use systems. They lie between natural forests and tree-crop plantations in terms of their structure and composition, and low intensity of forest extraction systems and the high intensity plantation systems in terms of their management intensity. Their management is characterized by combined use of silvicultural and horticultural operations, and spatial and temporal variations. These ecologically sustainable systems are often dynamic in species composition in response to changing socioeconomic conditions. Evolved over a long period of time as a result of local community's creativity, forest gardens have still received little attention in agroforestry research, just as in the case of the more intensively domesticated homegardens. The study of forest gardens offers good opportunities for obtaining a better understanding of the 'nature-analogous' agroforestry systems and for developing multifunctional agroforestry systems combining production and biodiversity values.

AB Tropical homegardens, one of the oldest forms of managed land-use systems, are considered to be an epitome of sustainability. Although these multispecies production systems have fascinated many and provided sustenance to millions, they have received relatively little scientific attention. The objective of this review is to summarize the current state of knowledge on homegardens with a view to using it as a basis for improving the homegardens as well as similar agroforestry systems. Description and inventory of local systems dominated the 'research' efforts on homegardens during the past 25 or more years. The main attributes that have been identified as contributing to the sustainability of these systems are biophysical advantages such as efficient nutrient cycling offered by multispecies composition, conservation of bio-cultural diversity, product diversification as well as nonmarket values of products and services, and social and cultural values including the opportunity for gender equality in managing the systems. With increasing emphasis on industrial models of agricultural development, fragmentation of land holdings due to demographic pressures, and, to some extent, the neglect-or, lack of appreciation-of traditional values, questions have been raised about the future of homegardens, but such concerns seem to be unfounded. Quite to the contrary, it is increasingly being recognized that understanding the scientific principles of these multispecies systems will have much to offer in the development of sustainable agroecosystems. Research on economic valuation of the tangible as well as intangible products and services, principles and mechanisms of resource sharing in mixed plant communities, and realistic valuation and appreciation of hitherto unrecognised benefits such as carbon sequestration will provide a sound basis for formulating appropriate policies for better realization and exploitation of the benefits of homegardens.

AB The issues of biological and genetic diversity management in agroforestry are extremely complex. This paper focuses on genetic diversity management and its implications for sustainable agroforestry systems in the tropics, and presents an analysis of the role and importance of inter- and intra-specific diversity in agroforestry. Diversity within and between tree species in traditional agroforestry systems and modern agroforestry technologies in the tropics is assessed, with a view to understanding the functional elements within them and assessing the role and place of diversity. The assessment shows that although the practice of agroforestry has been a diversity management and conservation system, research in agroforestry over time has de-emphasized the diversity element; nevertheless farmers do value diversity and do manage agroforestry from that perspective. Based on a profiling of various traditional agroforestry systems and research-developed technologies, a strong case is made for increased species- and genetic diversity, at both inter- and intra-specific levels. The review and analysis point to the need for increased awareness, training/education, partnerships and collaborative efforts in support of genetic diversity in agroforestry systems; of special importance is increased cross-disciplinary research.

AB Agroforestry practices in northern latitudes, although less diverse than those in warmer regions, have unique advantages over conventional land-use systems in the region in terms of water-quality enhancement, carbon sequestration, and biodiversity conservation. Tree intercropping, especially, is a potentially promising agroforestry option in the region. Understanding the ecological interactions between trees and crops in such intercropped systems provides the basis for designing efficient systems with potential for wider applicability. With this objective, the experience from several years of research on this aspect at the University of Guelph, in southern Ontario, Canada are presented. Yields of C3 crops intercropped with trees, as well as growth of trees, did not differ from those in corresponding sole-stand ( conventional) systems of crops and trees. But, soil organic carbon content and bird and insect diversity increased in the intercropped area. The abundance and distribution of earthworms were higher closer to the tree rows indicating improved soil health. The C sequestration potential in fast-growing tree ( hybridpoplar)based intercropping systems was four times more than that reported for conventional agricultural fields in the region. Because of reduced fertilizer use and more efficient N-cycling, the tree-intercropping systems could also lead to the reduction of nitrous oxide emissions from agricultural fields by about 0.7 kg ha(-1) yr(-1). Marginal or degraded land that is suitable for agroforestry is estimated to be 57 million ha in Canada. Tree/crop intercropping is one agroforestry system that shows great potential for this region. We suggest that this land-management option can be placed above conventional agriculture in terms of long term-productivity and sustainability.

AB As information on the economic, environmental and social benefits of cocoa has grown, so has the understanding that only a coordinated effort by all stakeholders can ensure cocoa sustainability. This chapter describes how challenges to cocoa supplies brought seemingly disparate - if not competitive - groups together in unique public/ private partnerships. While it is not meant to be an exhaustive listing of every initiative that has been developed, it provides an overview of how working across sectors has benefited all of those involved in the cocoa industry - corporations, governments, nongovernment organizations and individual farmers. The progress they have made and the lessons learned from these partnerships will help frame policies and practices aimed at ensuring a healthy future for all involved in the cocoa industry, and be a model for such initiatives for the development of other shaded perennial crops in agroforestry systems.

TI Flood-risk management strategies for an uncertain future: Living with
   Rhine river floods in the Netherlands?
SO AMBIO
LA English
DT Article
ID SEDIMENTATION
AB Social pressure on alluvial plains and deltas is large, both from an economic point of view and from a nature conservation point of view. Gradually, flood risks increase with economic development, because the expected damage increases, and with higher dikes, because the flooding depth increases. Global change, changing social desires, but also changing views, require a revision of flood-risk management strategies for the long term. These should be based on resilience as opposed to the resistence strategy of heightening dikes. Resilience strategies for flood-risk management imply that the river is allowed to temporarily flood large areas, whereas the flood damage is minimized by adapting land use. Such strategies are thus based on risk management and 'living with floods' instead of on hazard control. For The Netherlands, one of the most densely populated deltas in the world, alternative resilience strategies have been elaborated and assessed for their hydraulic functioning and 'sustainability criteria'.

AB The adoption of more efficient farming practices and technologies that enhance agricultural productivity and improve environmental sustainability is instrumental for achieving economic growth, food security, and poverty alleviation in sub-Saharan Africa. Our research examines the interaction between public investments, community health, and adoption of productivity and land enhancing technologies by households in the northern Ethiopian state of Tigray. Agricultural technology adoption decisions are modeled as a sequential process where the timing of choices can matter. We find that time spent sick and opportunity costs of caring for sick family members are significant factors in adoption. Sickness, through its impact on household income and labor allocation decisions for healthcare and other activities, significantly reduces the likelihood of technology adoption. Our findings suggest that agencies working to improve agricultural productivity and land resource conservation should consider not only the financial status of potential adopters, but also their related health situation.

AB The aim of this study is to show the advantages of the emerging multicommutation methodology based on the use of solenoid valves for Te determination in milk by hydride generation atomic fluorescence spectrometry (HG-AFS). The delivery of a series of alternating sequential insertions of small volumes of samples and reagents gives rise to new hydrodynamic processes and exciting analytical potentials by controlling the time of flow through the on/off-switched solenoid valves. This drastically reduces the reagent consumption by a factor of 4 and the generation of effluents (590 mL h(-1) instead of 750 mL h(-1) generated by the continuous-mode measurement) and also provides an improvement in the laboratory productivity by an increase of the sample throughput (85 h(-1) compared to 20 h(-1) found in the continuous mode). So, multicommutation is an environmentally and economically sustainable alternative to the methodology based on continuous measurements. The multicommutation-based method developed was applied to tellurium determination in commercially available milk samples; a calibration range of 0.0-0.5 ng mL(-1) and a detection limit of 0.20 ng L-1 with average relative standard deviation of 2.1% were found. Comparable results were obtained for a series of samples using both continuous and multicommutation HG-AFS modes.

AB The choices of universities and national research institutions in supporting scientific research are increasingly justified on the basis of, amongst others, the relevance that has to be reflected by external, preferably sustainable funding of the research programs. Many traditional fields of application such as environmental sciences do not offer a promising outlook in this respect. As a consequence, university research reactors face closure because of reallocations of university funds to more contemporary sciences such as molecular biology and nanotechnology. Therefore, laboratories operating nuclear analytical techniques (NAA, (TR)XRF, and PIXE) need to use their creativity in finding ways for participation in, for example, nanotechnology, cancer research, or genomics. This requires an open mind in terms of the opportunities, strengths, and weaknesses of the techniques, and a departure of technique-oriented research towards problem-oriented research in which other nuclear techniques can be used. The unique features of radiotracers, nuclear imaging, and nuclear beam techniques are discussed in view of the new areas mentioned above. Some examples of opportunities for nuclear analytical techniques in the above-mentioned fields are given.

SO ANIMAL CONSERVATION

ID SEED DISPERSAL; CONSERVATION; FORESTS
AB Wildlife capture and trade for traditional use in Papua New Guinea has led to the extirpation of cassowary in some areas and increasing pressure for trade from areas where they remain. We tested a village-based monitoring programme to evaluate sustainability of wildlife capture and trade by households in the Crater Mountain Wildlife Management Area. We monitored the type and number of wildlife species captured and traded. For the most heavily traded species, dwarf cassowary, we compared estimated annual offtake of live cassowary to maximum sustainable offtake and also compared change in hunter effort over time. We found that live offtake rates of 0.06-0.07/km(2) were unsustainable in one village catchment and on the threshold of unsustainable use in another. Extirpation of cassowary will probably occur in the management area unless the location or quantity of the harvest can be restricted and the husbandry of captive birds improved. Results indicate that village monitoring of cassowary offtake is feasible when done in collaboration with outside, trained observers. Such monitoring should be encouraged as a means for landowners and management agencies to collectively evaluate the sustainability of the cassowary harvest in Papua New Guinea. This study provides an example of how scientists working with local communities in tropical forests can contribute to systematic monitoring and evaluation of wildlife offtake for sustainable use.

AB Background and Aims Genetic structure and variability were examined in the only three extant populations of the narrow-endemic tree Antirhea aromatica (Rubiaceae, Guettardeae), an endangered species of the tropical forest of eastern Mexico. Patterns of genetic diversity within and among populations for adult plants and seedlings were obtained.
   Methods Allozyme electrophoresis of 15 loci was conducted and the data analysed with statistical approximation for obtaining genetic diversity, structure and gene flow.
   Key Results The mean expected heterozygosity (H,) in the adult and seedling populations was 0.18 +/- 0.08 and 0(.)20 +/- 0(.)09, respectively. The genetic variation explained by differences among populations was 51 and 35 %, for adult and seedling populations, respectively. On average, gene flow between paired adult populations was low (Nm = 0(.)26 +/- 0(.)09), compared with other trees from the tropical forest.
   Conclusions The results indicated that the populations evaluated have high genetic variability, compared with other endemic and geographically narrowly distributed plant species, in areas with high levels of environmental heterogeneity (e.g. tropical forests). The conservation implications of the results are discussed, and in this regard it is proposed that A. aromatica should be considered as an indicator species with economic potential. It is suggested that sustainable management practices should be implemented and that the areas where the species is distributed should be declared a natural reserve to ensure the species conservation.

AB In this study we compared the effects of fire on understorey vegetation in the Quebec southern boreal forest with effects of salvage-logging (clear-cutting after fire). All 61 400-m(2) sampling sites were controlled for overstorey composition (Deciduous, Mixed and Coniferous) and disturbance type, which consisted of three fire impact severity (FIS) classes (Light, Moderate and Extreme) and two harvesting techniques (Stem-only and Whole-tree Harvesting). Percent-cover data of vegetation and post-disturbance environmental characteristics were recorded in the field during the first two years after fire as well as soil texture. Ordination of fire alone demonstrated that, on Coniferous sites, fire initiates a succession whereby the understorey Coniferous sites approaches that of Deciduous-Mixed sites, due to the release of the understorey from Sphagnum spp. dominance, this pattern being a function of FIS. On Deciduous-Mixed stands, increased FIS resulted in a transition from herb to shrub dominance. Ordination of all five disturbance types showed that the impact of salvage-logging on understorey composition was within the range of fire, but marginalized to the extreme end of the FIS spectrum. Variance partitioning demonstrated that overstorey and soil texture were the most important explanatory variables of fire alone, while disturbance type explained the largest independent fraction of understorey variation when salvage-logging was introduced. Salvage-logging also results in significant reductions in understorey abundance, richness and diversity, while indicator species analysis suggests that it favours mesoxerophytic to xeric species. Results are interpreted in light of shade-tolerance dynamics, forest floor disturbance and soil moisture regimes. Implications for sustainable forest management are discussed.

AB Despite the hype and ostensible investments in child survival strategies, the state of child health in much of the developing world is alarming. Not only are global investments and support programmes for child health by the development agencies declining, but commensurate support for maternal and child health by poor countries themselves is poor. In order to make a meaningful contribution to maternal and child health and survival, a multi-pronged approach is needed which not only focuses on the proximal determinants of child health but also some of the underlying factors governing the status of women in society and expenditures on health and development.

AB There is worldwide consensus about the general purpose of nuclear safety, i.e. to protect people and the environment from the possible consequences of radiological exposures. Since the beginnings of the civil uses of nuclear power, nuclear safety research has been conducted with this objective in mind, and has thus become an indispensable part of research for the sustainable benefit of society. At the Karlsruhe Research Center, the safety of light water reactors (LWR) has been a major topic in its research and development program for more than thirty years.
   At the present time, the experimental facilities are being used for in-depth studies of complementary safety aspects of existing LWR plants.

AB Radical social changes in household formation over the past three decades have given rise to the single parent family. In spite of the level of public assistance, which is among the most generous in the OECD, research has shown that single parents (usually mothers) are among the most impoverished members of society. Recent legislation is moving toward mandating single parents off public assistance and into paid work in order for them to achieve more sustainable futures. In this paper we argue that this strategy is unlikely to succeed unless the particular needs of single parents are understood and addressed within a broader debate concerning women, care, and paid work. Family-friendly workplace practices, more extensive publicly funded childcare, and better opportunities for lifelong learning are some of the changes that are urgently needed to assist not only single parents but all who try to combine the dual roles of working and caring.

TI Patterns of algal recovery and small-scale effects of canopy removal as

AB The ecological importance of marine algae is widely known but in shallow coastal areas the composition and structure of algal communities may be affected by different human activities. Recovery from different trampling disturbances of two competing morphological groups (i.e. macroalgae and algal turfs) and effects of macroalgal canopy removal on the dominant associated fauna were examined using controlled trampling experiments. Six months after trampling disturbance was removed, the two morphological groups closely resembled control (untrampled) conditions, both in terms of cover and canopy (%). In particular, macroalgal recovery seemed to be very rapid: the higher the impact on the system the more rapid the recovery rate. In the short-term, the removal of macroalgal fronds (i.e. canopy) caused evident changes in invertebrate and crypto-benthic fish densities although these indirect effects were species- specific. Erect macroalgae are very sensitive to disturbance and even relatively low intensities of human use may be non-sustainable for this shallow assemblage. The present findings suggest some interesting options for the management of Mediterranean rocky shallow areas. This is crucial for coastal areas that are intended to be maintained in natural condition for conservation purposes. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   ventilation; sustainability; thermal modelling; urban heat island
AB Natural ventilation is a proven strategy for maintaining thermal comfort in non-domestic buildings in the UK. The energy consumption and thus the carbon dioxide emissions that contribute to global warming are lower than in conventional air-conditioned buildings. However, the ambient temperatures in the UK have risen over the last decade and new climatic data for use in the design of naturally ventilated buildings has been published. Using these data and dynamic thermal modelling, it is shown that passive stack ventilation alone was unlikely to maintain summertime comfort in a proposed University College London building within an urban heat island. The stack ventilation strategy was evolved by the introduction of passive downdraught cooling. This low-energy technique enables cooled air to be distributed throughout the building without mechanical assistance. The underlying principles of the technique were explored using physical models and the anticipated performance predicted using thermal modelling. The architectural integration is illustrated and the control strategy described. The resulting building is believed to be the first large-scale application of the passive downdraught cooling technique; construction began in late 2003.

AB Building energy performance contracting is a business strategy to assist building owners overcome the financial barriers for improving the energy performance of their buildings. In return for the investments made into the energy-saving measures, the energy service contractors would share with the building owners the energy cost saving. Although the contractual arrangement is meant to create a win-win situation, disappointments could arise due to mismatches between the expected and actual outcomes. From a micro-economics viewpoint, the key factors contributing to the failure of a building energy performance contract are reviewed. To solve the commonly encountered problems in building energy performance contracting, it is proposed the conventional performance contract is replaced with a partnership formed jointly by the building owner and the energy service contractor, with the latter assuming the role of the performance contractor. This would unite the goals of the two parties and cultivate genuine cooperation between them. The key features for this new contractual arrangement are described along with how this arrangement could resolve typical energy performance contracting problems.

AB Harvesting of marine living resources in the Southern Ocean is managed by the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), which is widely known for its ecosystem approach to managing fisheries and inclusion of food-web maintenance in the conservation objectives. CCAMLR has developed a precautionary approach to account for predators when setting catch limits for krill, the most important prey species in the Antarctic marine ecosystem. It has also established an ecosystem monitoring program to help detect effects of prey harvesting on predators. CCAMLR's approach is intended to permit both recovery of overexploited species and ecologically sustainable development of fisheries without causing damage to the Antarctic marine ecosystem. The trade-offs are between the harvest strategies (catches) and the ability to obtain sufficient information and knowledge for management of fisheries in a way that achieves the conservation objectives. This paper presents general principles of an ecosystem-based approach to fisheries using the CCAMLR approaches as examples. It discusses the precautionary and ecosystem approaches of CCAMLR, the types of objectives being considered for predators, and the general approaches and monitoring programs that could achieve ecosystem/food web conservation objectives.

AB Fisheries can cause major impacts on ecosystems, but the goal of managing them sustainably requires more and different information than we now have. Few fisheries have the legal mandate for ecosystem-based management or to apply precautionary management when information is lacking, so fishermen have little incentive to demand improved information. The California Marine Life Management Act of 1998 requires the maintenance of ecosystem health and diversity in California's complex nearshore ecosystems. We present the key elements, the scientific rationale, and an implementation plan for the transition from information-poor, precautionary management to information-rich, spatially explicit ecosystem-based management in the California nearshore finfish fishery. These elements are included in a fishery management plan adopted by the state in 2002. Marine reserves serve as reference points in repeated-measures before-after control-impact experimental design, in addition to their more familiar conservation benefits. The complexity of scientific monitoring, the statistical power of the monitoring design, and the benefits to consumptive and nonconsumptive uses and values all increase from information-poor to information-rich management. The most significant scientific hurdle comes with incorporation of ecosystem and environmental variability effects.

AB The serious threat posed by the spread of drug-resistant malaria in Africa has been widely acknowledged. Chloroquine resistance is now almost universal, and resistance to the successor drug, sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP), is growing rapidly. Combination therapy has been suggested as being an available and potentially lasting solution to this impending crisis. However, the current cost of combination therapy, and especially that of artemisinin combination therapy (ACT), is potentially a serious drawback, even if a significant part of its cost is passed on to the end-user. If the question of cost is not successfully addressed this could lead to adverse results from the deployment of combination therapy as first-line treatment. These adverse effects range from an increase in potentially fatal delays in infected individuals presenting to medical services, to exclusion of the poorest malaria sufferers from receiving treatment altogether. Urgent steps are needed to reduce the cost of combination therapy to the end-user in a sustainable way if it is to be usable, and some possible approaches are discussed.

AB Long-term silvicultural trials contribute to sustainable forest management by providing a better scientific understanding of how forest ecosystems respond to periodic timber harvesting. In this study, species composition, diversity, and net periodic growth of tree species in a mixed mesophytic forest in the central Appalachians were evaluated after about a half century of management. Three partial cutting practices on 18 research compartments and on 3 unmanaged reference compartments were evaluated (1951-2001) on 280 ha. Single-tree selection, diameter-limit harvesting, and timber harvesting in 0.162-ha patches were assessed on three northern red oak site index(50) (SI) classes: 24, 21, and 18. Shannon-Weiner's diversity index (H') declined from the first (1951-1959) to last (1987-2001) measurements and was related to both SI (P=0.004) and treatment (P=0.009) Sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) and red maple(Acer rubrum L.) were the two most abundant species in recent years (1987-2001); in contrast, in initial inventories (1951-1959), northern red oak (Quercus rubra L.) and chestnut oak (Quercus prinus L.) were most abundant. Net periodic annual increment (PAI) of merchantable trees (DBH greater than or equal to 12.7 cm) was related to both SI (P=0.004) and treatment (P= 0.003). Mean PAI ranged from 4.6 m(3.)ha(-1.)year(-1) for single-tree selection to 2.5 m(3.)ha.(1.)year.(1) for unmanaged reference areas across all SI classes. The decline of oak species suggests that only intensive and specific forest management focused on maintaining oak species can obtain historical levels of diversity.

ID PROCESS INTENSIFICATION
AB The chemical process industry aims particularly at energy, capital expenditure and variable feedstock cost savings due to fierce global competition, the Kyoto Protocol and requirements for sustainable development.
   Increasingly conceptual process design methods are used in the industry to achieve these aims. They are used in:
   " existing processes to renew parts;
   " process re-designs based on existing feedstocks and catalysts;
   9 innovative processes (new feed stocks, new catalysts, new process routes, new multifunctional equipment).
   This article is focused on the best industrial conceptual design practices applied for these application areas. To this end we have reviewed methods, which are used in the chemical process industry in the last 15 years. Capital, energy and variable cost savings are indicated for each method.
   Specific attention is paid to:
   functional integration to multi-functional equipment;
   heuristic based selection of unit operations and recycle structure;
   superstructure based design optimisation with mixed-integer-non-linear programming (MINLP).

TI Defining and experiencing dangerous climate change - An editorial essay
SO CLIMATIC CHANGE
LA English
DT Article
ID SOCIAL VULNERABILITY; GLOBAL CHANGE; PEOPLE KNOW; RISK; PERSPECTIVES;
   PERCEPTIONS; FUTURE
AB Understanding what constitutes dangerous climate change is of critical importance for future concerted action ( Schneider, 2001, 2002). To date separate scientific and policy discourses have proceeded with competing and somewhat arbitrary definitions of danger based on a variety of assumptions and assessments generally undertaken by 'experts'. We argue that it is not possible to make progress on defining dangerous climate change, or in developing sustainable responses to this global problem, without recognising the central role played by social or individual perceptions of danger. There are therefore at least two contrasting perspectives on dangerous climate change, what we term 'external' and 'internal' definitions of risk. External definitions are usually based on scientific risk analysis, performed by experts, of system characteristics of the physical or social world. Internal definitions of danger recognise that to be real, danger has to be either experienced or perceived - it is the individual or collective experience or perception of insecurity or lack of safety that constitutes the danger. A robust policy response must appreciate both external and internal definitions of danger.

ID DELIVERY
AB The objective of our study was to incorporate and evaluate Silymarin, a chemically defined natural hepatoprotective agent, in lipid microstructured systems. Various constituents of lipid microspheres - namely, internal oily core; surfactant such as soyabean lecithin; and cosurfactants such as span 20, tween 20, tween 80, and propylene glycol - were tried in different concentrations to optimize the final formulation characteristics such as globule size range, structural integrity, sustainability, and percent drug-holding capacity. The final formulation (formulation A) was characterized with respect to size and morphology using transmission electron microscopy and laser diffraction technique. The enhanced mean percent release of 56.70 +/- 2.03% was observed in 36 hr from silymarin-loaded lipid microspheres (formulation A), as compared to 18.67 +/- 0.192% with silymarin solution (formulation B). Thus, a stable delivery system having synergistic hepatoprotective effect of silymarin and soyabean lecithin could successively be produced for passive targeting to the liver.

AB The sustainability of a microalgae wastewater treatment plant model (ALGA), assumed serving a small Swedish town with 10,000 inhabitants at latitude 60degreesN, was tested by comparing it to a conventional three-step treatment plant (WWTP), and a mechanical and chemical treatment plant (TP) complemented with a constructed wetland (TP + CW). Using two assessment methods-the socio-ecological principles method and emergy analysis-the ALGA model considered to have a better position for sustainable development, than the other two. In emergy terms the ALGA model had about half the resource use of the other two alternatives, and used most local free environmental resources, four times the TP + CW, and 100 times the WWTP. The violations against the second and third socio-ecological principles were considered equal for the three alternatives, the fourth was estimated to be in favor of the ALGA model, and the first principle was calculated to be in favor of the ALGA model with about eight times lower indicator value sum. Recirculation of nutrients back to society or production of economically viable products from the treatment by-products would strongly influence the sustainability. The ALGA model has a potential advantage due to interesting biochemical contents in the microalgae biomass, depending on what species will become dominating. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB The understanding of complex interactions involving ecosystem components is indispensable for sustainable development of humankind. To date. ecological research has mainly concentrated on investigations of direct relationships, whilst indirect interactions (and in particular the less obvious, e.g. delayed ones) have often been overlooked. Investigation of mechanisms underpinning complex indirect relationships in ecosystems is greatly aided by mathematical techniques, including correlation, multiple regression and factor analysis, simulation modelling, path analysis and methods of network analysis, etc. This paper provides a brief review of the recent relevant studies. Mathematical modelling techniques may be especially useful if used in concert on a range of ecosystems, thus integrating the information obtained in a comparative theoretical ecosystem analysis (CTEA). A methodological framework for CTEA is given, limitations of the review are acknowledged and possible implications discussed. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Roundput [Int. J. Sustainable Dev. World Ecol. 8 (2001) 29] is one of the most important principles of the development of both natural and industrial ecosystems, and is especially important for analysis of an ecosystem's dynamics and overall functioning. as it is related to an extent to which energy and matter are recycled and used in a cascade-type operation. Here we argue. using two modelling case studies from the UK and Switzerland, that increasing recycling rates for plastic and glass would improve the energy budget of waste management programmes, and, therefore, benefit the corresponding industrial ecosystems. In the first case study we show that the major source of energy savings from glass recycling is through increased use of cullet in glass manufacture (5.4% reduction in total energy consumption with 100% glass recycling when compared to the present-day situation). In terms of energy consumption, recycling is the preferred waste management option, even if a large proportion of the recycled glass is diverted for use as aggregates. Further energy savings could be achieved by introduction of a city-wide kerbside collection scheme, which would result in an estimated maximum reduction (100% recycling rate) of 7.6% in energy consumption for processing of the Southampton household glass wastes. In the second case study we compare the situation in which all wastes are burnt at a MSWI plant with two scenarios assuming that 8.1 % of the plastic is diverted into a cement Kiln (mixed plastics; scenario 1) or a mechanical recycling plant (polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene; scenario 2). The resulting net primary energy consumption values for both scenario 1 (5.85E8 MJ or 60% relative to the reference scenario) and 2 (7.46E8 MJ or 76.6% relative to the reference scenario) use less primary energy than the reference scenario (9.74E8 MJ). This means that, from the point of view of resource consumption, the diversion of plastics waste away from the MSWI plant has a beneficial effect. Therefore, the increased recycling of glass and plastic would benefit the industrial ecosystems in terms of energy savings. This is similar to the patterns observed in most natural ecosystems, and a careful consideration of this similarity within a framework of industrial ecology should help to reduce the conflict between the two systems.

AB Relative body size has long been recognized as a factor influencing reproductive success in fishes, but maternal age has only recently been considered. We monitored growth and starvation resistance in larvae from 20 female black rockfish (Sebastes melanops), ranging in age from five to 17 years. Larvae from the oldest females in our experiments had growth rates more than three times as fast and survived starvation more than twice as long as larvae from the youngest females. Female age was a far better predictor of larval performance than female size. The apparent underlying mechanism is a greater provisioning of larvae with energy-rich triacylglycerol (TAG) lipids as female age increases. The volume of the oil globule (composed primarily of TAG) present in larvae at parturition increases with maternal age and is correlated with subsequent growth and survival. These results suggest that progeny from older females can survive under a broader range of environmental conditions compared to progeny from younger females. Age truncation commonly induced by fisheries may, therefore, have severe consequences for long-term sustainability of fish populations.

AB Fisheries exploitation provides the opportunity to examine the ecosystem-scale biodiversity consequences of predator removal. We document predatory reef fish densities, coral-eating starfish densities and coral reef structure along a 13-island gradient of subsistence exploitation in Fiji. Along the fishing intensity gradient, predator densities declined by 61% and starfish densities increased by three orders of magnitude. Reef-building corals and coralline algae declined by 35% and were replaced by non-reef building taxa (mainly filamentous algae), as a result of starfish predation. Starfish populations exhibited thresholds and Allee-type dynamics: population growth was negative under light fishing intensities and high predator densities, and positive on islands with higher fishing intensities and low predator densities. These results suggest the depletion of functionally important consumer species by exploitation can indirectly influence coral reef ecosystem structure and function at the scale of islands.

AB We investigate two-player infinitely repeated games where the discount factor is less than but close to unity. Monitoring is private and players cannot communicate. We require no condition concerning the accuracy of players' monitoring technology. We show the folk theorem for the prisoners' dilemma with conditional independence. We also investigate more general games where players' private signals are correlated only through an unobservable macro shock. We show that efficiency is sustainable for generic private signal structures when the size of the set of private signals is sufficiently large. Finally, we show that cartel collusion is sustainable in price-setting duopoly.

TI Replacing diesel by solar in the Amazon: short-term economic feasibility
   of PV-diesel hybrid systems
SO ENERGY POLICY
LA English
DT Article
DE photovoltaies; hybrid systems; Amazon
AB Energy planning in the Brazilian Amazon faces two major challenges. One is that of helping the off-grid population improve a situation of discomfort, environmental risks and high lighting costs. Another is that of cutting fuel subsidies in the local utility grids supplied by diesel generators. Simulation shows that PV systems with energy storage connected to existing diesel generators, allowing them to be turned of during the day, provide the lowest energy costs. Implementation potential of that choice is evaluated for local grids up to 100 kW, where transportation costs cause maximal wholesale diesel prices for Northern Brazil to be increased of 15% and more, it is economical to convert diesel systems up to 50 kW peak power into hybrid systems. In locations where the costs increase is of 45% and more, systems up to 100 kW turn economical. A new legal mechanism for subrogation of diesel subsidies to renewable energy projects changes those limits to 0% and 21%, respectively. Therefore, the actors in power generation are motivated to consider solar energy. A program with the scope described should give the Brazilian photovoltaic industry a relevant push and launch a transition towards a sustainable power supply for the region. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Although energy is the key element for improving the quality of life, ever increasing use of fossil fuels cannot be the basis for sustainable development. These have unexpected environmental consequences in local and global scale. The need to increase energy supply in a developing country like India is unquestionable. To meet the proposed energy needs, India must produce nearly double the quantity of coal (550 Mt/y) by 2010 AD, as it is mining at present. Rapid growth of the energy sector has made environmental protection a highly complex and more difficult task. There is a pressing need for alternate sustainable supplies of energy. This article examines the energy resources and some of the key environmental issues in these sectors. The focus is on the options available for the supply of energy. Geothermal energy, its potential, recovery, present scenario of utilization and its utility as a cleaner source have been discussed. The development of non-conventional energy in Indian context has been described. This article concludes by identifying geothermal energy as one of the potential sources of energy for maintaining a clean environment.

AB Solar energy technologies offer a clean, renewable and domestic energy source, and are essential components of a sustainable energy future. Turkey lays in a sunny belt between 36degrees and 42degrees N latitudes and is geographically well situated with respect to solar energy potential. The objective of the present study is to investigate many aspects of solar energy applications in Turkey, giving the brief historical development and Turkey's solar energy potential and consumption. The following applications were taken into consideration: solar water heating, steam generation, solar cooker, solar drying, solar houses, and photovoltaics (PVs). In the early 1960s, solar energy was realized as an alternative energy in Turkey, while in the mid-1970s, solar thermal utilization technologies began gaining the high attention of universities, the government and, the industry, and have been developed at an increasing speed. Residential and industrial consumption of solar energy in Turkey started in 1986 and 1988, respectively. Solar energy use accounted for 129 kilo tons of oil equivalent (ktoe) in 2000 and is projected to be 431 ktoe and 828 ktoe in 2010 and 2020, respectively. Among all the above solar thermal utilization methods, the solar water heating has been, and will still have, the greatest emphasis in Turkey, reaching a total annual production capacity of 1,000,000 m 2 . Recently, the number of the PV installations has significantly increased and Turkey's total PV installed capacity is expected to be 3 MWp in 2010.

AB Depleted communities are a persistent feature of late capitalism. They can be seen as areas that have lost much of their economic rationale as space, while retaining high attachments and social relations of place. While conditions in depleted communities can limit possibilities for traditional development, entrepreneurial responses are not similarly constrained. It is argued here that depleted communities can act as hosts to a unique form of enterprise that combines good business practices with community goals. We refer to this as community business entrepreneurship and argue that it is similar to, but distinct from, the traditional entrepreneurial process. To illustrate these ideas three cases are examined. Within the setting of the depleted community, the entrepreneurial process can be modified to pursue community goals, thereby creating new opportunities and making new forms of development possible.

AB This study developed small-area health-related environmental indices for England and Wales in the context of an investigation into socioeconomic inequity in the distribution of environmental risk. Selection of environmental hazards, relevant datasets, and their attribution to standard small-area geography using a geographic information system are described. Four indices for 1991 Census wards are proposed, relating to ambient air quality, atmospheric chemical releases from large-scale industrial processes, landfills, and sites registered under Control of Major Accident Hazard regulations. Ecological measures of association between these indices and the Carstairs material deprivation index and its components are presented in the context of variations by urban-rural status. Based on these analyses, the study generally supports previous findings of environmental inequity in England and Wales, but highlights that associations are dependent on the environmental and deprivation measures under consideration, and urban-rural context. It is proposed that environmental indices such as those described here should be included in considerations of area deprivation, could assist with equitable environmental decisionmaking and planning, and that measures of environmental inequity could be considered as indicators of progress towards sustainable development.

AB Transport plays an important role in sustainable development because it uses a lot of energy. in order to plan for sustainable transport development, there is a need to develop indicators for assessing and monitoring transport development. In this paper we develop a sustainable transport development indicator by making use of the concepts of accessibility and geographical information systems. A modal accessibility gap index is proposed, which is calculated by finding the difference between the accessibility indices of public and private transport, which are in turn determined by accessibilities to opportunities such as the number of population, jobs, shops, and schools by public and private transport. Considering energy-efficiency, public transport will achieve sustainable transport more than private transport. A higher accessibility gap may mean more sustainable development. In the present study, the accessibility gap of Hong Kong in 1991 is compared with that in 1996 to examine whether transport development has been more sustainable. We also discuss how to use the accessibility gap indicator to test land-use and transport-development policies and scenarios to determine the more sustainable ones.

TI The role of the building regulations in achieving housing quality
SO ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING B-PLANNING & DESIGN
LA English
DT Article
AB Urban policy in the United Kingdom emphasises the importance of good design as a key component in the revitalisation of towns and cities. In particular, housebuilders are being encouraged to develop sustainable construction practices, and to sensitise the design of dwellings to incorporate local building materials, design styles, and traditions. The government has noted that the building regulations will play a key role in ensuring the development and delivery of design quality. However, there is little or no knowledge of how far, and in what ways, the building regulations will be able to attain the objectives that government has set. The paper evaluates the role and relevance of the building regulations in seeking to deliver design quality in dwellings. It does so with reference to an empirical study of Part M of the building regulations (for England and Wales). This requires builders to provide access to dwellings for disabled people. The research indicates that the use of the building regulations is unlikely to raise, significantly, the quality of design in dwellings.

AB Surface- vs. ground-water chemistry in the Heihe River basin, assessed through field sampling of precipitation, surface water and groundwater, allowed geographical zones and chemical types to be differentiated. The geographical zones included: alpine ice-snow (>3,900 m), alpine meadow (3,400-3,900 m), mountain forest and shrub (2,600-3,400 m), mountain grassland (1,9002,600 m) and desert grassland (1,500-1,900 m). Groundwater chemical types included: (1) mountain fissure and piedmont gravel, bicarbonate, (2) piedmont diluvial, alluvial and lacustrine plain, sulphate, and (3) desert salt-accumulating depression, chloride. Since the 1960s, large volumes of river water diverted for irrigation have been found to re-emerge as spring water at the edge of alluvial fans and then reintegrate the Heihe River. After a number of reuses and re-emergences in the middle reaches, the river's level of mineralization has doubled. Hydrological changes have resulted in the marked degradation of aquatic habitats, and caused substantial, and expanding, land salinization and desertification. Solving these largely anthropogenic problems requires concerted, massive and long-term efforts.

AB The objective of analytical strategic environmental assessment (ANSEA) is to provide a decision-centred approach to the SEA process. The ANSEA project evolved from the realisation that, in many cases, SEA, as currently practised, is not able to ensure an appropriate integration of environmental values. The focus of SEA is on predicting impacts, but the tool takes no account of the decision-making processes it is trying to influence. At strategic decision-making levels, in turn, it is often difficult to predict impacts with the necessary exactitude. The decision-making sciences could teach some valuable lessons here.
   Instead of focusing on the quantitative prediction of environmental consequences, the ANSEA approach concentrates on the integration of environmental objectives into decision-making processes. Thus, the ANSEA approach provides a framework for analysing and assessing the decision-making processes of policies, plans and programmes (PPP). To enhance environmental integration into the decision-making process, decision windows (DW) can be identified. The approach is designed to be objective and transparent to ensure that environmental considerations are taken into account, or-from an ex-post perspective-to allow an evaluation of how far environmental considerations have been integrated into the decision-making process under assessment. The paper describes the concepts and the framework of the ANSEA approach and discusses its relation to SEA and the EC Directive. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Assessing sustainability in compliance with the EU water framework directive is affected by numerous conflicting interests. As they can no longer be resolved by means of intuitive reasoning, some authors propose the integration of the major fragmented indicators into one common indicator of the overall sustainability by means of a codified multi-criteria decision support methodology (DSM). Practitioners in urban water management, however, usually object to the use of a codified DSM, as in the legal context (negotiations between the stakeholders, tendering procedure) it might jeopardize the feasibility of the decision making process (DMP). Here we show that a feasible implementation of a DSM into the DMP is possible. To this end, we design a cooperative approach, which by means of an axiomatic evaluation helps to select an appropriate DSM. We illustrate it by a hypothetical dialogue between the relevant authority and the developer. It will expose the inherent limitations of the DSM, which are due to their underlying mathematical features. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

SO ENVIRONMETRICS

DT Article
AB Prawn trawling is a major fishing activity in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, generating millions of dollars for the Australian economy. It is important that appropriate management decisions are made to ensure the sustainability of the industry. An experimental study was conducted to quantify the recovery of seabed fauna after repeated trawling. Data from the study were composed of counts of observed benthic organisms on the seabed. The data were analysed using models based on a generalization of the simple Poisson process, which allows for over-dispersion and under-dispersion relative to the Poisson distribution. It was found that these models more faithfully described the data than more standard models such as the Poisson or negative binomial. It is argued that the use of inappropriate models can result in unreliable inferences, which in turn could lead to poor management decisions. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB This article presents an informed definition of sustainability and an associated planning model for sustaining innovations (pertinent to both infrastructure and interventions) within organizational, community, and state systems. The planning model stems from a systematic review of the literature and from concepts derived from a series of 'think tanks' made up of key substance abuse prevention professionals. The model assumes a five-step process (i.e. assessment, development, implementation, evaluation, and reassessment/modification) and addresses factors known to inhibit efforts to sustain an innovation. One set of factors concerns the capacity of prevention systems to support sustainable innovations. The other pertains to the extent to which a particular innovation is sustainable. A sustainability action strategy is presented that includes goals with corresponding sets of objectives, actions, and results that determine the extent of readiness to sustain an innovation. Sustainability tools to assist in implementing the planning model are illustrated, and next steps for the model are discussed. This planning model provides a conceptual and practical understanding of sustainability that can lead to further investigation. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper summarizes outcome findings from an evaluation of residential treatment projects funded by the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT), in the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, under its Residential Women and Children and Pregnant and Postpartum Women demonstration programs. It first examines client-level treatment outcomes as indicated by pre-post changes in drug and alcohol use, criminal involvement, economic well-being, parenting success, and other important outcome dimensions. Post-treatment status was assessed through interviews administered 6 months after discharge to a sample of approximately 1200 former clients from 32 treatment sites. The paper also examines projects' success in obtaining continuation funding after the initial 5-year CSAT grant ended. Project sustainability provides another major indicator of the perceived value and effectiveness of the treatment program's services. Key findings were that a majority of former clients (61%) reported being completely drug- and alcohol-free throughout the follow-up period, large pre-post improvements were noted in other important areas of client and family functioning, and most of the projects begun with CSAT seed-money support (92%) were able to continue operations after the grant support ended.

AB Voucher-based reinforcement therapy (VBRT) is an effective drug abuse treatment, but the cost of VBRT rewards has limited its dissemination. Obtaining VBRT incentives through donations may be one way to overcome this barrier. Two direct mail campaigns solicited donations for use in VBRT for pregnant, postpartum, and parenting drug users in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and in Los Angeles, California. In Toronto, 19% of those contacted over 2 months donated $8,000 ($4,000/month) of goods and services. In Los Angeles, nearly 26% of those contacted over 34 months donated $161,000 ($4,472/month) of goods and services. Maintaining voucher programs by soliciting donations is feasible and sustainable. The methods in this article can serve as a guide for successful donation solicitation campaigns. Donations offer an alternative for obtaining VBRT rewards for substance abuse treatment and may increase its dissemination.

AB Riverside Forest Products (Kelowna, British Columbia) has embraced a sustainable forest management approach for the management of one its forest tenures-Tree Farm License 49. This document discusses the rationale behind many of the concepts within this approach in the context of current ecological theory. We focus specifically on the following concepts: (1) forest retention, (2) ecosystem representation, (3) ecological contributions from unharvested forests, (4) zoning and the TRIAD approach, (5) stand-level habitat elements and landscape-level features, and (6) ecological indicators. This document provides an example of the application of current ecological theory within a commercial forestry operation in Canada and is thus broadly applicable to foresters, forest managers, and researchers in most jurisdictions.

AB We previously demonstrated that sustainable enhanced levels of transgene products could be expressed from a bacterial DNA-free expression cassette either formed from a fragmented plasmid in mouse liver or delivered as a minicircle vector. This suggested that bacterial DNA sequences played a role in episomal transgene silencing. To further understand the silencing mechanism, we systematically altered the DNA components in both the expression cassette and the bacterial backbone, and compared the gene expression profiles from mice receiving different DNA forms. In nine vectors tested, animals that received the purified expression cassette alone always expressed persistently higher levels of transgene compared to 2fDNA groups. In contrast, animals that received linearized DNA by a single cut in the bacterial backbone had similar expression profiles to that of intact plasmid groups. All three linear DNAs formed large concatemers and small circles in mouse liver, while ccDNA remained intact. In all groups, the relative amount of vector DNA in liver remained similar. Together, these results further established that the DNA silencing effect was mediated by a covalent linkage of the expression cassette and the bacteria DNA elements.

AB The Amazon River, its huge basin, and the changes in biological processes that are rapidly occurring in this region are unquestionably of global significance. Hence, Global Change Biology is delighted to host a special thematic issue devoted to the Large-scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia (LBA), which is a multinational, interdisciplinary research program led by Brazil. The goal of LBA is no less modest than its subject: to understand how Amazonia functions as a regional entity in the Earth system and how these functions are changing as a result of ongoing changes in land use. This compilation of 26 papers resulting from LBA-related research covers a broad range of topics: forest stocks of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N); fluxes of greenhouse gases and volatile organic compounds from vegetation, soils and wetlands; mapping and modeling land-use change, fire risk, and soil properties; measuring changes caused by logging, pasturing and cultivating; and new research approaches in meteorology to estimate nocturnal fluxes of C from forests and pastures. Some important new synthesis can be derived from these and other studies. The aboveground biomass of intact Amazonian forests appears to be a sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), while the wetlands and soils are a net source of atmospheric methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), respectively. Land-use change has, so far, had only a minor effect on basin-wide emissions of CH4 and N2O, but the net effect of deforestation and reforestation appears to be a significant net release of CO2 to the atmosphere. The sum of the 100-year global warming potentials (GWP) of these annual sources and sinks of CH4, N2O, and CO2 indicate that the Amazonian forest-river system currently may be nearly balanced in terms of the net GWP of these biogenic atmospheric gases. Of course, large uncertainties remain for these estimates, but the papers published here demonstrate tremendous progress, and also large remaining hurdles, in narrowing these uncertainties in our understanding of how Amazonia functions as a regional entity in the Earth system.

AB The spatial distribution of human activities in forest frontier regions is strongly influenced by transportation infrastructure. With the planned paving of 6000 km of highway in the Amazon Basin, agricultural frontier expansion will follow, triggering potentially large changes in the location and rate of deforestation. We developed a land-cover change simulation model that is responsive to road paving and policy intervention scenarios for the BR-163 highway in central Amazonia. This corridor links the cities of Cuiaba, in central Brazil, and Santarem, on the southern margin of the Amazon River. It connects important soybean production regions and burgeoning population centers in Mato Grosso State with the international port of Santarem, but 1000 km of this road are still not paved. It is within this context that the Brazilian government has prioritized the paving of this road to turn it into a major soybean exportation facility. The model assesses the impacts of this road paving within four scenarios: two population scenarios (high and moderate growth) and two policy intervention scenarios. In the 'business-as-usual' policy scenario, the responses of deforestation and land abandonment to road paving are estimated based on historical rates of Amazon regions that had a major road paved. In the 'governance' scenario, several plausible improvements in the enforcement of environmental regulations, support for sustainable land-use systems, and local institutional capacity are invoked to modify the historical rates. Model inputs include data collected during expeditions and through participatory mapping exercises conducted with agents from four major frontier types along the road. The model has two components. A scenario-generating submodel is coupled to a landscape dynamics simulator, 'DINAMICA', which spatially allocates the land-cover transitions using a GIS database. The model was run for 30 years, divided into annual time steps. It predicted more than twice as much deforestation along the corridor in business-as-usual vs. governance scenarios. The model demonstrates how field data gathered along a 1000 km corridor can be used to develop plausible scenarios of future land-cover change trajectories that are relevant to both global change science and the decision-making process of governments and civil society in an important rainforest region.

AB Land use and land cover changes in the Brazilian Amazon region have major implications for regional and even global carbon cycling. We analyzed the effects of the predominant land use change, conversion of tropical forest to pasture, on total soil C and N, using the Century ecosystem model and data collected from the Nova Vida ranch, Western Brazilian Amazon. We estimated equilibrium organic matter levels, plant productivity and residue carbon inputs under native forest conditions, then simulated deforestation following the slash and burn procedure. Soil organic matter dynamics were simulated for pastures established in 1989, 1987, 1983, 1979, 1972, 1951, and 1911. Using input data from the Nova Vida ranch, the Century model predicted that forest clearance and conversion to pasture would cause an initial decline in soil C and N stocks, followed by a slow rise to levels exceeding those under native forest. Simulated soil total C and N levels (2500 g C m(-2) and 245 g N m(-2) in the 0-20 cm layer) prior to conversion to pasture were close to those measured in the native forest. Simulated above- and below-ground biomass for the forest and pasture were comparable with literature values from this region. The model predicted the long-term changes in soil C and N under pasture inferred from the pasture chronosequence, but there was considerable variation in soil C stocks for pastures <20 years in age. Differences in soil texture between pastures were relatively small and could not account for much of the variability between different pastures of similar ages, in either the measured or simulated data. It is likely that much of the variability in C stocks between pastures of similar ages is related to initial C stocks immediately following deforestation and that this was the largest source of variability in the chronosequence. Internal C cycling processes in Century were evaluated using measurements of microbial biomass and soil delta(13)C. The relative magnitude and long-term trend in microbial biomass simulated by the model were consistent with measurements. The close fit of simulated to measured values of delta(13)C over time suggests that the relative loss of forest-derived C and its replacement by pasture-derived C was accurately predicted by the model. After 80 years, almost 90% of the organic matter in the top 20 cm was pasture derived. While our analysis represents a single 'case study' of pasture conversion, our results suggest that modeling studies in these pasture systems can help to evaluate the magnitude of impacts on C and N cycling, and determine the effect of management strategies on pasture sustainability.

AB Both gaming and group (decision) support systems (GDSS) are frequently used to support decision-making and policymaking in multi-actor settings. Despite the fact that there are a number of ways in which gaming and GDSS can be used in a complementary manner, there are only sporadic examples of their combined use. No systematic overview or framework exists in which GDSS are related to the functions of gaming or vice versa. In this article, we examine, why, how and for what purpose GDSS can be used to enrich and improve gaming simulation for decision support, and vice versa. In addition to a review of examples found in the literature, four games are discussed where we combined gaming and GDSS for complex decision-making in a multi actor context: INCODELTA, a game about transportation corridors; INFRASTRATEGO, a game about a liberalizing electricity market; CONTAINERS A DRIFT, a game about the planning of a container terminal, and; DUBES, a game about sustainable urban renewal. Based on the literature and these four experiences, a classification is presented of (at least) four ways in which GDSS and gaming can be used in a complementary or even mutually corrective, manner: the use of GDSS for game design, for game evaluation, for game operation and the use of gaming for research, testing and training of GDSS.

AB Predicted shortages and recruitment targets for nurses in developed countries threaten to deplete nurse supply and undermine global health initiatives in developing countries. A twofold approach is required, involving greater diligence by developing countries in creating a largely sustainable domestic nurse workforce and their greater investment through international aid in building nursing education capacity in the less developed countries that supply them with nurses.

TI Emergency department capacity and access in California, 1990-2001: An
   economic analysis
SO HEALTH AFFAIRS
LA English
DT Article
AB Media report that hospitals are closing their emergency departments (EDs) and reducing access to ED services, raising concerns that EDs are not sustainable under competition and managed care. We analyzed financial, economic, capacity, and utilization data for California EDs for 1990-2001. We found that contrary to media reports, hospitals are not abandoning the ED market. Rather, our results show a robust market, where hospitals are adding ED capacity to meet increased demand and to maintain access. Supporting economic analyses show that EDs are sustainable since they generate a sizable and growing portion of inpatient admissions, which contribute to overall economic viability.

TI Auto Action Learning: a tool for policy change - Building capacity
   across the developing regional system to improve health in the North
   East of England
SO HEALTH POLICY
LA English
DT Article
DE action learning; investment for health; policy change
AB Health policy traditionally has tended to focus on health care policy. The World Health Organisation Investment for Health approach aims to influence policy development by locating health as both the outcome of, and an asset for, sustainable economic and social development. The policy context in England offers a range of drivers and opportunities to operationalise the Investment for Health approach through action to improve health and reduce inequalities, nationally and as importantly at a regional and local level. This paper traces developments in the North East of England April 2002-November 2002, from the perspective of an advocate for developing a systemic and systematic approach using an Investment for Health approach. The tool used to track change is based in action learning [M. Pedler, Action Learning for Managers, Lemos and Crane, London, 1996]. The Action Learning Problem Brief identifies why the goal is important, who to, how progress might be identified, difficulties and benefits. Generally. this acts as a starting point for problem solving within an Action Learning Set. This piece of work uses the framework for reflection and tracking, with input from a mentor, at four to eight weekly intervals, 'Auto Action Learning'. The authors pull out key learning points from the process, using a framework 'Towards a model for systematic learning from doing in the North East of England'. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

TI Constraints: The un-doing of the Ugandan truth Commission
SO HUMAN RIGHTS QUARTERLY
LA English
DT Article
AB In the aftermath of a period of mass atrocity at the hands of the state, many societies struggle to find a way to repair the damage caused to the physical infrastructure in terms of things like roads, hospitals, and schools. Yet the social infrastructure is also often badly damaged. One mechanism often employed in such cases is the truth commission, which can act to foster sustainable development on many different levels, as well as social trust.
   When Yoweri Museveni and the NRM acceded to power in Uganda in 1986, one of their first acts was to establish the Commission of Inquiry into Violations of Human Rights to look into the abuses which had been perpetrated from 1961 until that time. The Commission, however, was endowed with neither proper funding nor political support. The social infrastructure, therefore, was left in a state of flux. This paper provides an analysis of the many constraints faced by the Commission and of its relative failure to provide a platform for improving the social infrastructure.

AB A highly photosensitive indium-doped germano-silicate fiber (In-Ge fiber) has been developed for fiber Bragg grating (FBG) fabrication. Tests carried out on the photosensitivity of the fiber have shown that the grating written into this fiber may show a high refractive index modulation, of 3.2 x 10(-4). Annealing experiments of the FBGs written into this fiber have shown that the FBGs can survive a temperature as high as 900 degreesC for 24 h and even 1000 degreesC for over 2 h. The results of the high temperature annealing studies are presented, as well as the relationship between the peak wavelength of the FBG and temperature, indicating the value of FBG-based devices for high temperature use in such fibers.

AB Tamarind, a multipurpose tropical tree species, is economically important for sustainable development of wasteland due to its hardy nature and adaptability to Various agroclimatic conditions. Reports on in vitro morphogenesis in this species are limited, due to its recalcitrant and callogenic nature. To overcome these limitations, an attempt was made to induce meristematic activity in seedling explants. Seedlings were germinated in medium with or without thidiazuron (4.54,9.08, 13.12, 18.16 muM). This growth regulator restricted the differentiation of the apical meristem to form shoots. It triggered proliferation of the meristematic tissue at the cotyledonary node and a large number of meristematic buds appeared ill a radial pattern around the node. The meristematic activity extended to the junction of the epicotyl and hypocotyl, giving rise to buds in the form of protuberances in all sides of the junction. These buds differentiated to form shoot primordia and subsequently to shoots in medium devoid of growth regulators. Plants developed by micrografting of these shoots oil seedling-derived rootstocks survived in soil.

DT Article
AB The establishment of sustainable productive spaces is possible when starting from an effective integration of the social and institutional components of the productive activity, which requires an ample articulation of actions by different actors connected with such activity. A brief description is presented of the fundamental characteristics of the socio-institutional learning of environmental aspects in developed countries, and some considerations are made about the industrialization process and environmental learning in Venezuela. The process of industrial. de-concentration of the Caracas metropolitan area is described, as also is the conformation of the urban-industrial axis of Tejerias-Puerto Cabello, which implied the installation of a multi-sector industrial, park of high environmental impact within the most important endorheic basin of Venezuela, the Lake of Valencia. The fragility of the socio-institutional framework of the productive activity is emphasized, in particular the weakness of official agencies to enforce regulations. This weakness has led to serious environmental consequences, there being at present non-sustainable productive areas in various parts of the country.

AB The process industries (specifically, energy and chemicals) are characterized by a variety of reactors and reactions to bring about successful process operations. The design of energy-related and chemical processes and their evolution is a complex process that determines the competitiveness of these industries, as well as their environmental impact. thus, we have developed an Enviro-Energy Concept designed to facilitate sustainable industrial development. The Complete Onion Model represents a complete methodology for chemical process design and illustrates all of the requirements to achieve the best possible design within the accepted environmental standards. Currently, NOx emissions from industrial processes continue to receive maximum attention, therefore the issue problem of NOx emissions from industrial sources such as power stations and nitric acid plants is considered. The Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) is one of the most promising and effective commercial technologies. It is considered the Best Available Control Technology (BACT) for NOx reduction. The solution of NOx Emissions problem is either through modifying the chemical process design and/or installing an end-of-pipe technology. The degree of integration between the process design and the installed technology plays a critical role in the capital cost evaluation. Therefore, integrating process units and then optimizing the design has a vital effect on the total cost. Both the environmental regulations and the cost evaluation are the boundary constraints of the optimum solution.

AB This paper analyses two-way access pricing in a telecommunications market where consumers an heterogeneous in their demand for calls and firms are allowed to use non-linear tariffs. We first investigate how the presence of access charges affects the tariffs offered by firms in symmetric equilibrium. Next we show that under certain conditions each firm's profit is independent of the level of(reciprocal) access charge and, therefore, collusion using access charges is not sustainable. This result suggests that efficient call-allocations can be achieved under a minimal regulatory intervention, i.e. recommending firms set access charges equal to call-termination cost.

TI MOPECO: an economic optimization model for irrigation water management
SO IRRIGATION SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
ID SIZE
AB Water is a natural, sometimes scarce, and fundamental resource for life, essential both for agriculture in many regions of the world and also to achieve sustainability in production systems. Maximizing net returns with the available resources is of the utmost importance, but doing so is a complex problem, owing to the many factors that affect this process (e.g. climatic variability, irrigation system configuration, production costs, subsidy policies). The MOPECO model is a tool for identifying optimal production plans, and water irrigation management strategies. The model estimates crop yield, production and gross margin as a function of the irrigation depth. Finally, these gross margin functions are used to determine an optimum cropping pattern and irrigation strategy to maximize the gross margin on a farm in a specific scenario. Since the relationships between the variables are generally non-linear and the number of alternative strategies is quite large, the optimum process is complex and computationally intensive. Genetic algorithms are therefore used to identify optimal strategies. This paper describes the MOPECO model, which comprises three computing modules: (1) estimation of net water requirements; (2) derivation of the relationship between gross margin and irrigation depth; and (3) identification of the crop planning and the water volumes to be applied. The results obtained by applying the MOPECO model to a specific irrigable area in a semi-arid area of Spain, with great deficits and high water costs, are also included and discussed. These results usually show that the irrigation depth for maximum benefits is lower than that necessary to obtain maximum production. In some areas of Spain, horticultural crops are nearly always part of the optimum alternative. The crops that become part of the optimum alternative are mainly horticultural crops with a high gross margin and low water requirements. The irrigation depths selected for the ideal crop rotation are included among the irrigation depth of maximum economic efficiency and the maximum gross margin irrigation depth. Both are lower than that necessary for the maximum yield. This model helps farmers, extension services, and other agents to analyse, make decisions and optimize water management.

AB We use stochastic optimal control-dynamic programming (DP) to derive the optimal debt/net worth, consumption/net worth, current account/net worth, and endogenous growth rate in an economy - which could be a country, region or sector within a country. Unlike the literature that uses an intertemporal budget constraint or the Maximum Principle, the DP approach does not require perfect foresight or certainty equivalence. Our results are generalizations of the Merton model, and are explained graphically within a mean-variance context. Two examples are provided to illustrate the usefulness of our technique in predicting debt crises. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Development is skewed in disfavor of the geographical zone of the Niger-Delta of Nigeria because of public policies that have consistently failed to improve the welfare of the people. Part of the development enigma is orchestrated by the exploitative tendencies of multinational oil companies that have blandly plundered for fossil fuel and thereby truncated the sustainability of the indigenous environment. The continuing crisis of youth restiveness and resistance is traceable to this larger development issue. This article examines the prevailing social trend in the Niger-Delta and concludes rather emphatically that some of the consequences of social disequilibrium (e.g., the ubiquity of social miscreants [area boys],juvenile delinquents, and other deviant behaviors) cannot be understood independently of environmental problems that stem from a warped development initiative that roundly undermines the existential base of the Niger-Delta peoples.

DE sustainable development; United Nations; pragmatism
AB An historical overview of the United Nations sustainable development initiative reflects a convergence of political and ethical concerns, and a need to incorporate business and the ethics of business into an inclusive perspective. Underlying all of the resolutions and recommendations ensuing from that initiative is the age-old question of ``the one and the many,'' with which theology and philosophy have grappled for centuries, and sociology and politics in more recent times. Inherent to sustainable development is a need to overcome that question, especially with respect to the power of the wealthier nations. Good old American Pragmatism offers a solution which, at once, respects individual and communal sovereignty while positing a dynamic interaction between the two. That interaction offers an optimistic approach to global business and to global business ethics.

AB The 20th century produced overwhelming advances in biomedicine with the 1990s introducing 148,000 patents as part of the mapping and sequencing of the human genome. Bioethical realities and debates of prenatal genetic testing, new reproductive technologies, stem cell research, human cloning and DNA data banks have obscured the less provocative public and social issues of gun control, immunization, employee leave programs to assist care for dying relatives, emergency room use as primary care sites by the uninsured, and medical care provision to the homeless. With the events of September 11, the focus has shifted to bioterrorism: an international and global concern that portends broad environmental consequences while requiring a local, community response of which the business enterprise is a part. The tension that results from a required local and global response to bioterrorism and biotechnology by the business community forms a dialectic and provides a venue for addressing business ethics in an international forum. This paper explores the relationship of events and its meaning for business. Part I provides the background of biotechnology and bioterrorism and how the two form a dialectic reality that shapes ethical debate. Part II presents provocations and questions for an emerging ethic based on the integrative response from the public health, medical, business and religious communities. Four areas for business contribution in shaping emerging ethics in the age of biotechnology - bioterrorism are suggested.

AB In recent years, increasing environmental dynamism and the adaptability of the firm have attracted new academic interest in how manufacturing firms adapt to their environments and create superior business performance. However, the discussion has been somewhat hampered by the lack of research incorporating the context, content, and outcome perspectives of adaptability. In this article, we will develop a conceptual framework of the adaptability construct and explore relationships between dimensions of adaptability and innovativeness. The results of our empirical study indicate that several components of adaptability are significantly different between low- and high-performing firms, as measured by their innovativeness. The type of business logic and the nature of environmental dynamism strongly influence the adaptability-innovativeness relationship among the firms examined. In view of the positive and sustainable adaptability-innovativeness linkages, managers should simultaneously address the technology, market, and organization-related issues in line with the dominant contextual factors involved.

TI Falls prevention revisited: a call for a new approach
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NURSING
LA English
DT Article
DE accountability; care; empowerment; patient falls; prevention
ID QUALITY NURSING-CARE; POWER; TIME; WORK
AB Background. Patient falls constitute a major threat to health services' ability to provide care. Previous studies confirm that nurses can identify patients at risk and that a preventative programme can reduce the rate of falls but few studies have been evaluated over time.
   Aims and objectives. A study was undertaken to test a Falls Prevention Programme in an acute medical area that was re-evaluated 5 years later to determine if the effects were sustainable.
   Design. The design included two groups of patients admitted before and after the programme. Variables such as staffing, equipment, environment and routines were controlled. However, because of ethical approval constraints, some variables such as age, mental status, mobility and gender were not.
   Methods. The programme included a risk assessment tool, a choice of interventions, a graphic that alerted others to 'at risk patients' and simple patient and staff education. Data were collected using incident forms and a formula was used to calculate a rate of falls. A non-paired t-test compared rates and ANOVA examined the relationship of age, gender, mobility and mental status on the incidence of falls. Control graphs determined the stability of the process.
   Results. The falls rate was significantly reduced. Control graphs demonstrate that the process achieved greater control with less variation. In the next 5 years the falls rate increased to preprogramme levels and control graphs demonstrated that the process was no longer controlled. Compliance with the programme had deteriorated.
   Conclusions. The practice review considered skill mix, patient activity and acuity but provided no definitive answers to explain non-compliance. The implications to nursing are discussed.
   Relevance to clinical practice. Clinicians are called to conduct more rigorous research into falls prevention but it may be more useful to direct research towards examining nursing work and increasing nurse autonomy in falls prevention.

   Developing relational knowing for sustainable natural resource
   management
SO JOURNAL OF COMMUNITY & APPLIED SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE multi party collaboration; social learning; framing and reframing;
   relational practices; learning for interdependence
AB This article develops a conceptual framework to theorize about and to intervene in multi-party collaboration projects related to natural resource issues. It is a recent trend in public and private interorganizational policy that multiple actors get involved to collaborate around issues of water and soil management, nature preservation, land use, farming practices, introduction of new technologies in life sciences and related problem domains. Awareness grows that blue print planning-implementation approaches are no longer sufficient to obtain viable and sustainable outcomes. The technical complexity and social embeddedness of these issues, require the collaboration of public authorities, private business, scientific experts, groups of users and social interest groups, non-governmental organizations and representatives of stakeholders in the particular ecological domain. The central concern is always an interdependent involvement of the stakeholders, the development of a shared problem definition, the coordination of the different actions on all levels and the orientation towards a shared common script and action strategy. Social psychology and particularly organizational psychology, building on theories of interorganizational collaboration and social and organizational development, are challenged to make a contribution here. The different stakeholders engage in joint practices where the acknowledgement and the development of viable interdependencies are at stake. Learning about those interdependencies is considered in this article as the critical constitutive process and form of these multi-party projects. Through sharing problem perspectives and working with different kinds of knowledge and competencies, multiple actors or stakeholder parties co-construct a social learning process in an emerging community of practice.

ID RURAL APPRAISAL PRA
AB In this article we address our experiences with a so-called participatory approach in a Vietnamese-Belgian water management project. This project aimed, in its social science component, at stimulating and studying processes of reflexive social learning and of participation and negotiation on local water management issues and on project activities. In this article we intend to show how specific project-related strategies and attempts towards facilitating participation fail and how other initiatives seem to succeed or at least to elicit valuable processes of negotiation and learning. We start from the commonly held view on participation as committed to reverse or subvert power relations. However, our research experiences indicate that participation is always part of an operation of power, governing people to behave themselves in a particular determined way. From this Foucauldian governmental perspective, we are able to reconsider the success and failure of participatory approaches, not so much in terms of the effectiveness of their application, but rather in terms of the possibility to refuse 'participatory' government.

AB Several alternatives are being attempted to obtain the Sustainable residential building, based on the acceptable level of in conflict each other, thus it is very environmental impact and socio-economic characteristics of residential building. These criteria are difficult to assess or find the Sustainable residential building. This paper presents a methodology of the assessment for residential building that is intended to assist the decision making for the building planners or practitioners. The results show that this approach can effectively work for the quantitative evaluation and selection of the best alternative of the residential buildings considered, especially when conflict relation exists. This approach allows the planner or construction companies to test design strategies against different sets of criteria.

AB Three galactopoietic stimuli, frequent milking (4X), bovine somatotrophin (bST) and thyroxine (T4) were used in an additive stair-step design to achieve maximum output (metabolic capacity) in six peak-lactation cows of high genetic merit (HT) and six of low genetic merit (LT). A further six of each merit were untreated controls (HC, LC). Milk yield was increased significantly by 4X, increased further by the combination of 4X and bST and increased further still and significantly by the full combination of 4X, bST and T4. The magnitude of the yield response to the sequence of treatments did not differ significantly between HT and LT. The yield response to 4X and bST was sustainable without significant loss of body weight or body condition score for the 6 weeks during which these stimuli were administered. The response to the full combination, which included T4, was accompanied by significantly elevated heart rate and significant loss of body weight and condition compared with the combination of 4X and bST. As a result, treatments were discontinued, on an individual cow basis, before completion of this 6-week phase. Time on experiment did not differ between HT and LT. The results do not support the commonly held belief that selective breeding of dairy cows for high milk production has rendered them markedly more susceptible to metabolic disturbances.

AB A preliminary investigation of factors affecting controlled struvite crystallization was conducted in bench-scale studies using a new crystallization reactor design, operating under a range of reactor and feed strength conditions. In 21 different experiments, it was found that the bench-scale reactor functioned well in terms of achieving good particle classification, although its performance was somewhat restricted in terms of P removal. Reactor operation was generally somewhat compromised because of scale effects. As a preliminary to further (ongoing) pilot-scale investigations, it was found that, for a given set of operating and feed strength conditions, there was a specific value of pH (pH(lim)) beyond which the reactor would not operate effectively. The pH value is an important operating parameter in struvite crystallization, and the mode of pH operation plays a major role in determining struvite crystal quality. When operated at pH values exceeding pH(lim), poor quality (i.e., dendritic) crystals were produced and reactor plugging often occurred. A qualitative assessment of temperature effects on crystallization reactions suggested that low temperatures may indeed favour struvite crystal growth. Reactor seeding was not found to be a factor of any particular importance since, once struvite crystallization reactions were underway, the reactor appeared to be "self-seeding".

AB When food inspectors pay educational visits to food service establishments, the goal is prevention. For that reason, such visits form a valuable component in local-government programs to improve food safety. The efficacy of educational programs can be measurably improved by the application of behavioral-change theory.
   The study reported here was conducted with the cooperation of Key Arena Sportservice, a large sports arena in downtown Seattle, Washington, The facility serves 1.2 million customers per year through 40 individual food service operations staffed by approximately 250 workers. Analysis of facility inspection reports for the period 1998 through 2001 identified three key types of violation. Problematic food preparation processes were analyzed and modified through the application of behavioral-change theory. Food safety inspection reports were used to detect and evaluate changes in behavior. Results from the study appear to support the authors' hypothesis, which was that sustainable improvements in food safety, as measured by food service inspection scores, can be achieved through the systematic application of behavioral-change theory in active partnership with industry.

AB Transgenic or genetically modified plants possess novel genes that impart beneficial characteristics such as herbicide resistance. One of the least understood areas in the environmental risk assessment of genetically modified crops is their impact on soil- and plant-associated microbial communities. The potential for interaction between transgenic plants and plant residues and the soil microbial community is not well understood. The recognition that these interactions could change microbial biodiversity and affect ecosystem functioning has initiated a limited number of studies in the area. At this time, studies have shown the possibility that transgenes can be transferred to native soil microorganisms through horizontal gene transfer, although there is not evidence of this occurring in the soil. Furthermore, novel proteins have been shown to be released from transgenic plants into the soil ecosystem, and their presence can influence the biodiversity of the microbial community by selectively stimulating the growth of organisms that can use them. Microbial diversity can be altered when associated with transgenic plants; however, these effects are both variable and transient. Soil- and plant-associated microbial communities are influenced not only by plant species and transgene insertion but also by environmental factors such as field site and sampling date. Minor alterations in the diversity of the microbial community could affect soil health and ecosystem functioning, and therefore, the impact that plant variety may have on the dynamics of the rhizosphere microbial populations and in turn plant growth and health and ecosystem sustainability, requires further study.

AB Food products of high quality and safety are primary objectives for Nestle since the Company was founded in 1866. Agricultural raw materials are the key ingredients for both quality and safety. Their production conditions, with respect to the farming community, the environment, animals, and. best-adapted production technologies, are crucial to achieve these objectives on a long-term basis. While differing consumer preferences have to be respected world-wide to gain continuing demand for our products, we also need a sustainable supply of raw materials. We therefore encourage sustainable development in agriculture and support it. We provide, as far as feasible, technical assistance to producers and to farmers and analyze how sustainable the applied production methods are. Nestle supplies a wide range of raw materials for which Nestle, together with Group Danone and Unilever, has created the Sustainable Agriculture Initiative [SAI] of the International Food Industry. The first objective of SAI is to catalyze sustainable development in agriculture, in general; to create awareness, share knowledge, and encourage participating member companies to promote sustainable agriculture. SAI invites all interested food companies to participate in the Initiative. It searches the dialogue with all relevant stakeholders to include their views as far as they contribute to the objective and to obtain the best means of tracing and monitoring throughout the supply chain.

AB To assess the sustainability of forest use for woodfuel, above ground biomass increment must be examined against woodfuel consumption. However, reliable data on the biomass increment of tropical forests are very limited. In this study, we estimated above ground forest biomass increment in Kampong Thom Province, Cambodia, using two consecutive measurements of 32 permanent sample plots in 1998 and 2000, and forest inventory data of 540 plots collected in 1997. The permanent sampling plot data were used to determine the relationship between initial biomass and subsequent biomass increment over a 2-year period. This relationship was applied to the inventory data to obtain a robust estimate of biomass increment across the major forest types for the entire province. The weighted average annual above ground biomass increment for the whole province was 4.77Mg/ha, or 2.3% of biomass. Woodfuel consumption was estimated to be about 2% of biomass increment for the province, suggesting that deficiency of woodfuel may not occur in this province. However, localized variation needs to be taken into account and there is a need to examine the effects of stand age and factors such as soil type, microtopography, and species composition on biomass increment and to consider woodfuel collection rate in specific forest areas with respect to accessibility for firewood collection.

ID OBESITY
AB With the epidemic of obesity worldwide, bariatric surgery has rapidly grown in popularity. Currently, a variety of surgical procedures are performed including Roux-en-Y gastric by, pass, laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding, vertical banded gastroplasty, and biliopancreatic diversion. All of these procedures have been shown to succeed in achieving significant and sustainable weight loss for the majority of patients. However, these procedures also carry the potential for serious operative morbidity, altered gastrointestinal anatomy or function, or both. Electrical gastric stimulation via the implantable gastric stimulation (IGS) system is a relatively new and novel approach to treat obesity. The operative technique is relatively simple and the system does not alter gastrointestinal anatomy. Preliminary worldwide investigations have demonstrated safety and efficacy. This article will review the current experience with the IGS system. (C) 2004 The Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract.

AB Musculoskeletal complaints are common, but are often under-emphasized in residency training. We evaluated the experience of residents (12) in 4 sessions of an innovative concentrated ambulatory, community-based musculoskeletal (MS) clinic precepted by general internists with additional training in teaching MS medicine. Compared with the yearlong longitudinal house staff (HS) clinic experience, the mean number of musculoskeletal diagnoses per resident seen in MS clinic was higher (13.9 [standard deviation 4.0] vs 5.4 [standard deviation 4.0]; P < .01). Common diagnoses in MS clinic included shoulder, hip, and knee tendonitis/bursitis, and the majority of diagnoses in HS clinic were nonspecific arthralgia (66%). Fifty-two injections were performed in MS clinic over the year, compared with one in HS clinic.

TI A practice change model for quality improvement in primary care practice
SO JOURNAL OF HEALTHCARE MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID PREVENTIVE SERVICE DELIVERY; CLINICAL-PRACTICE; HEALTH-CARE; PHYSICIANS;
   IMPACT; BEHAVIOR; RATES
AB Faced with a rapidly changing healthcare environment, primary care practices often have to change how they practice medicine. Yet change is difficult, and the process by which practice improvement can be understood and facilitated has not been well elucidated. Therefore, we developed a model of practice change using data from a quality improvement intervention that was successful in creating a sustainable practice improvement. A multidisciplinary team evaluated data from the Study To Enhance Prevention by Understanding Practice (STEP-UP), a randomized clinical trial conducted to improve the delivery of evidence-based preventive services in 79 northeastern Ohio practices. The team conducted comparative case-study analyses of high- and low-improvement practices to identify variables that are critical to the change process and to create a conceptual model for the change.
   The model depicts the critical elements for understanding and guiding practice change and emphasizes the importance of these elements' evolving interrelationships. These elements are (1) motivation of key stakeholders to achieve the target for change; (2) instrumental, personal, and interactive resources for change; (3) motivators outside the practice, including the larger healthcare environment and community; and (4) opportunities for change-that is, how key stakeholders understand the change options. Change is influenced by the complex interaction of factors inside and outside the practice. Interventions that are based on understanding the four key elements and their interrelationships can yield sustainable quality improvements in primary care practice.

SO JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES

DT Article
ID INFECTIOUS-DISEASES; VACCINATION; ENGLAND; IMMUNITY; MODELS; IMPACT;
   WALES
AB The theory of disease transmission provides a consistent framework within which to design, evaluate, and monitor measles elimination programs. Elimination of measles requires maintaining the effective reproduction number R at <1, by achieving and maintaining low levels of susceptibility. The essential features of different vaccination strategies (e.g., routine versus campaigns, number of doses) can be compared within this framework. Designing an elimination program for a particular population involves setting target levels of susceptibility, establishing the current susceptibility profile, selecting an approach to reduce susceptibility below the target, and selecting an approach to maintain susceptibility below the target. A key indicator of the sustainability of an elimination program is the residual level of susceptibility of a cohort after it has completed its scheduled vaccination opportunities. This can be estimated from vaccination coverage data. The high transmissibility of measles poses a significant challenge to any attempt to eliminate it.

   irrigation efficiency; data analysis; Spain
AB The semiarid climate of the majority of agricultural districts in the Mediterranean means that water is a key factor limiting production. It is therefore necessary to distribute water in the most efficient way possible and foment the sustainable use of this valuable resource. It is a difficult task to ascertain whether the use of water in an irrigation district is efficient or not, given that water as a resource cannot be considered in an isolated manner. The development of techniques for data envelopment analysis (DEA) has made it possible to evaluate, in a global manner, where the application of water is most efficient. DEA techniques consider the production process as a set of inputs which obtain a set of outputs in the form of profits. The study of efficiency as a combination of resources allows us to assess when the application of water will lead to greater profitability and hence aid water management authorities in distributing the water of their basins in an appropriate manner. In this study, the data envelopment analysis Baker, Charnes, and Cooper model is applied to all of the irrigation districts in Andalusia (Southern Spain). Using the Wilcoxon-Mann-Withney statistical test we conclude that extensive agriculture (located in the interior) and intensive agriculture (on the littoral) are difficult to compare. Although intensive agriculture with localized irrigation systems achieves the highest efficiency values, the spatial distribution of efficiencies is of great utility in detecting local inefficiencies. It is also useful in providing general guidelines as to which trends should be followed in order to obtain the greatest possible efficiency.

SO JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY OF EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB There appear to be various respects in which the outdoor environment has been regarded as significant for education in general and moral education in particular. Whereas some educationalists have considered the environment to be an important site of character development, others have regarded attention to conservation and sustainable development as pressing moral educational concerns in a world of widespread human environmental abuse. The following paper argues that approaches to environmental education that proceed by way of character education or environmental ethics may yet fall short of the central goal of promoting intrinsic appreciation of nature and the outdoors, and explores an alternative strategy focused on exposure to the arts.

SO JOURNAL OF RANGE MANAGEMENT

   utilization; seasonal utilization
ID AVAILABILITY DATA
AB Management of feral horses grazing on Atlantic and Gulf coast barrier islands requires information on seasonal habitat preferences and distribution of important forage species to maintain stable populations and prevent destruction of fragile island ecosystems, particularly as coastal development further restricts free range. Counts from seasonal aerial surveys of Currituck Banks, N.C. were used to determine whether particular habitats were used more or less than would be expected by chance. On-ground observations were used to determine the relative intensity of grazing on vegetation by habitat and season. Feral horses showed seasonal preferences for particular forage species and habitat types. Horses grazed upon at least 16 graminoid and 5 forb species across 6 identified habitat types covering 4,619 ha. In late winter, Maritime Forest was used significantly more than expected while Tidal Freshwater Marsh was used less than expected. In spring, all habitats were used in the proportion expected based on availability. In early summer, Wet Grassland was preferentially used while Dry Grassland was preferentially avoided. The relative degree of exposure from wind may explain why horses spent less time than expected in exposed marshes during winter and more time than expected in forest. The availability of fresh water and hydrophytes may explain why horses spent more time than expected in Wet Grassland in summer and less time than expected in Dry Grassland. Seasonal habitat preferences should be considered when managing for ecosystem sustainability of feral horses on barrier islands.

ID RUMINANTS; COPPER
AB Revegetation and sustainable cattle grazing are major objectives in the reclamation of mine tailings at the Highland Valley Copper mine in British Columbia, Canada. A total of 84 cow-calf pairs grazed forage extremely high in molybdenum (Mo) for 11 weeks in the summer and fall for 3 consecutive years (1999-2001). The average stocking rate was 0.63 ha AUM(-1). The animals' diet consisted primarily of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) and orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.) containing 100-400 ppm Mo. Both cows and calves showed adequate daily gains of 0.78 kg head(-1) day(-1) and 1.33 kg head(-1) day(-1), respectively. Uptake of Mo was demonstrated by elevated levels of Mo in rumen contents and feces. Clinical signs of Mo toxicity were observed in less than half of the cows and in only a few calves. Clinical signs included a stiff shuffling gait, watery diarrhea, and a rough hair coat. Lameness, the primary sign, was resolved in all animals by the end of each trial. Diarrhea was also resolved by the end of the trial and hair coats returned to normal by the following spring. The onset and severity of the affliction appeared to be related to prevailing moisture conditions, which may have affected Mo availability in forage. Some affected animals were treated with Cu injections to no avail. Liver biopsies and serum samples showed marginal to adequate copper (Cu) levels but potentially toxic levels of Mo. In the third year of the trial, Cu-containing boluses were employed but they did not prevent the onset of clinical signs.

AB The cocoa relatives T grandiflorum (cupuacu) and T bicolor (macambo) are promising crop plants for sustainable agroforestry in the Amazon region of South America. The market for cupuacu is expanding since the fruit flesh is utilised by the foodstuffs industry. Attempts to commercialise chocolate-like wares from the seeds have failed so far because of unreliable product quality. It is not known whether this is due to an insufficient aroma potential of cupuacu seeds. We therefore investigated the proteolytic enzymes and the seed storage globulins which are both decisive for the formation of aroma precursors in cocoa. We found that the activities of the aspartic endopeptidase and the carboxypeptidase in T bicolor and T grandiflorum differed slightly from those in cocoa. The specificity of the carboxypeptidase for hydrophobic amino acids was quite similar across the three species, while the optimal pH of the T grandiflorum enzyme was lower than that of the other species. The qualitative and quantitative differences between the globulins indicate a lower maximum yield of aroma precursors in T grandiflorum and a higher maximum yield of aroma precursors in T bicolor, compared to cocoa. We conclude that the quality of chocolate-like products made from the studied cocoa relatives can be improved by adapting fermentation procedures to particular biochemical features of these seeds.

AB Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) or kala-azar (KA) affects the rural poor, causing significant morbidity and mortality. We examined the epidemiological and social impact of KA in an affected village in Bangladesh. A population-based survey of the village residents showed a case fatality rate of 14.7% among females and 5.3% among males. Before initiation of the study, female patients were ill longer than males before they received treatment. Future work needs to focus on understanding the implications of KA on women and to develop sustainable strategies for appropriate and timely access to treatment.

First, infrastructure sectors, unlike manufacturing, suffer from the "market failure" problem. and the solution to that problem-government regulation-brings with it the "obsolescing bargain" risk. Second, such investments are even riskier when made in developing countries, which are characterized by weak institutions and political instability. Why, then, did the boom occur, and will it continue? Three industry-specific drivers and two country-specific drivers are considered for the boom. Foreign investors may have believed: (1) that infrastructure sectors were losing their "natural monopoly" characteristics; (2) that first-movers would profit handsomely from the emerging globalization of these sectors; (3) that novel techniques like project financing would reduce their risks sharply; (4) that the climate for FDI in developing countries had changed fundamentally in the 1990s; and (5) that host developing countries would not expropriate foreign-owned infrastructure assets as they had in the past. Based on actual experience in the 1990s, we evaluate the strengths and limitations of each of these drivers. Our overall assessment is that infrastructure FDI in developing countries will stabilize in the future at a lower. more sustainable level. We conclude with policy implications for multinational corporations (MNCs) and governments. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB What is overgrazing? Does it cause soil erosion? The recent debate from the ecological literature is reviewed as background to the debate on overgrazing and soil erosion. This debate stresses the need to view dryland grazing systems as dynamic ecosystems driven more by rainfall events than by livestock numbers. The case for soil erosion is then examined. Two case studies from communal rangelands in the Eastern Cape, South Africa, have cast doubts on the conventional wisdom that overgrazing leads to soil erosion. The first, a study of historical land-use change and erosion in a communal area, showed that the most intense erosion, taking the form of steeply dissected badlands, was associated with cultivated land that had been abandoned and reverted to grazing from the 1960s onwards. Such severe erosion was generally absent from land that had been under grazing since the 1930s. The second study demonstrated that erosion rates from communal grazing lands ('overgrazed') were only slightly higher than those from land under 'optimal' grazing, that is grazing at a level considered not to exceed the carrying capacity of the land. These results support the ecologist's contention that communal grazing systems do not necessarily degrade the range condition relative to management systems based on a notional carrying capacity.

DE multi-annual drought; river Jordan; lake kinneret; Israel
AB Floods and droughts are the most common of natural disasters, and the number of victims and the economic damage are both greater than those caused by other events such as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. The drought that affected Israel between 1998 and 2001 was of unusual climatic and hydrologic severity; the most serious in the last 125 years in northern Israel. The climatic drought affected the water flow of the Jordan River and the level of Lake Kinneret, which fell to -214(.)90 m (below sea-level), the lowest lake level in historical periods. The annual flow of the Jordan River in the drought period was the lowest in the 50-year hydrological record.
   Human interference, water pumping and flow diversion, exacerbated the negative drought impact, causing land degradation such as the drying of wetlands and salinization of freshwater aquifers. The failure to introduce drought contingency planning and sustainable water resources management has so far affected agriculture and nature conservation. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB Population trends and factors have been identified as indicators of sustainability. Existing plans for sustainable development have generally recognized demographic trends and factors as elements that have a critical influence on consumption patterns, production, lifestyles and long-term sustainability. The aim of this study, which was carried out at Ratau in Lesotho, was to examine the relationship between demographic dynamics and environmental degradation. The objective was to identify the nature and extent of the relationships between the prevailing land degradation and demographic factors at Ratau, and thereby appraise its sustainability. It was found that Ratau was overpopulated, overgrazed, underdeveloped and degraded. It was further established that there is some linkages between material poverty of the villagers, poor agricultural-land management and environmental degradation, which indicates an adverse synergistic relationship between demographic dynamics and sustainable rural development in the study area.

AB Much of Bangladesh has experienced land degradation due to technological change in agriculture in an attempt to increase food production. This study examines the impacts of cultivation of high-yielding variety (HYV) rice, using power tillers, low-lift irrigation pumps, chemical fertilizers and pesticides, on selected land and soil qualities during the period 1985-2000 in a village in Southwestern Bangladesh. For the purpose, three types of land uses were identified: fields traditionally plowed to cultivate rain-fed local aman rice using cow-manure and very little or no pesticides; plots power tilled to cultivate rain-fed HYV aman rice using full-dose application of chemical fertilizers and pesticides; and fields power tilled to cultivate rain-fed HYV aman rice followed by low-lift pump irrigated HYV boro rice using double doses of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. Based on 120 soil samples collected from 60 plots representing these three land-use types, the present study revealed significant changes in soil texture, bulk density and structure, increases in soil acidity and salinity, depletion of Ca, Mg, K, N, P, Zn, and organic C in double-cropped irrigated rice fields compared to the rain-fed single-crop rice fields. Power-tilled plots have shown higher rate of soil erosion and loss of soil structure than traditionally plowed fields. Low-lift pump irrigated fields were more degraded than rain-fed rice fields. Soil degradation has affected the yield of rice while cultivation of HYV rice has decreased the fodder production that affected livestock population. While technological change was necessary to meet the growing population demand for food, its negative impacts on land and soil qualities are alarming and should be minimized by adopting more sustainable techno-managerial methods and continuous soil monitoring.

AB Land degradation associated with agriculture has been recognized worldwide as posing serious environmental, natural resource and human problems. As a consequence, the Australian Government agricultural agencies, while still focusing on agricultural development, are increasingly being required to add social and biophysical environmental objectives to their more traditional economic development roles. One of the difficulties faced by agencies in achieving this aim is the lack of appropriate skills by their traditionally educated professional staff.
   This paper shows bow one such agency, the Western Australian Department of Agriculture, is responding to major land degradation problems and the need to undertake integrated land-use planning to achieve sustainable development objectives. In particular, following a tender process whereby the authors provided advice on alternative means of achieving the agency's objectives, the authors were contracted through the University of Western Australia's Institute for Regional Development to mount an on-line course designed for agency officers.
   While students have responded positively to the course content, a number of problems relating to the delivery of this course has emerged. They include the feeling of isolation by the students, problems with web designer over educational philosophies, the inordinate amount of time involved in writing and delivering the course, and unresolved questions relating to intellectual property. The question still remains as to whether the course will achieve the primary underlying objective of attaining sustainable agricultural development. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB Sustainable development has been a popular buzzword among policymakers and economists for over a decade. Although a key tenet of maintaining a sustainable development path for many economies rests on attracting mobile capital, theoretical and empirical evidence into the institutional policies that attract factors remains largely unresolved. This paper takes a positive look at the determinants of attracting capital with particular attention paid to intellectual property rights and environmental regulations.

AB In Europe, when small (> 0.01 km(2)) lakes are considered, approximately 500,000 natural lakes occur. This considerable number points to the fact that lakeshore habitats and ecosystems are of significant importance to the total biodiversity of European landscapes, not only because of their expanse, but also because they are ecotones between land and water, which attract many kinds of wildlife, economical, cultural and recreational uses and human settlement. These very considerable stretches of shore are not currently registered, mapped or evaluated anywhere.
   Apart from providing habitat, the littoral biocoenosis performs a string of additional functions in the ecosystem, of which several are also of great importance to people, such as self purification, buffer zone, erosion protection and recreation scenery. In particular, the recreational function provides a main economic base for many lake areas and even whole countries in Europe. However, human interests have resulted in lake shore deterioration, such that many European lakes are now bare natural shores or retain only relics of them. Apart from the loss of the ecological functions, this also leads to a substantial loss of economic benefits. This precipitates the need for a responsible management, which can be done only on the base of a sound assessment method and a continuous monitoring of the status of lake shore areas. On a European scale, the European Water Framework Directive (WFD, 2000/60/EC) and the Habitat Directive (92/43/EEC) provide the frame for the assessment and monitoring of the status of littoral habitats of lakes. The WFD, focuses on entire surface water bodies, including their associated wetlands under influence of their natural water-level fluctuations. However, the provided set of quality elements has to be adapted for an approach specific to lake shores. Apart from quality elements indicating the natural spatial pre-requisites, biocoenotic diversity and integrity, and ecosystem function and dynamics, also quality elements representing the human pressure of land use and the social and economic value of the lake shore zone should be included in an integrated lakeshore assessment and monitoring concept.
   However, the application of such an integrated quality assessment scheme requires an integrated administrative counterpart, just as the WFD requires for water management aspects on a catchment scale. Only by overcoming the splitting of competence among a variety of authorities and planning corporations can an integrated approach to sustainable shore development be translated into action.

AB This article will consider the broad geopolitical considerations in measures towards biodiversity conservation and governance of high seas areas. Traditionally, international law has provided for jurisdiction based upon flag State in high seas areas, and States have shown themselves reluctant to depart from this model. International organisations with responsibility for high seas living resource management have proven, in many cases, to be of limited utility in the sustainable management of high seas resources. This traditional norm of flag State jurisdiction, while still dominant, is now being joined by the use of supra-national management in the context of regional fisheries organisations under the United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement. Part of the reason for this limited effectiveness is the focus of individual States on national interest, which may undermine international cooperation. The paper explores what mechanisms exist within international law that would permit a more effective management of high seas biodiversity conservation, and how these may be used to combat the erosion of the effectiveness of measures by individual State interests. Recognition of geopolitical factors that undermine cooperation in biodiversity conservation, and active efforts to address these matters, will prove essential in the establishment of a successful regime for high seas areas.

   management
AB 'Sustainability' figures routinely but prominently as a guiding principle for all those working in coastal management. In order to be able to progress coastal sustainability, it is necessary to understand more fully the normative structure of the concept by breaking down the key constructs inherent in the definition of sustainability. To this end a short questionnaire was disseminated to an 'expert' group of coastal and resource management professionals. The data gathered was analysed using the Qualitative Research Solutions (QSR) package, Nud*ist 6, and highlighted a number of theoretical concepts that were commonly held to be determinative of sustainability. These may form the basis for the future development of a 'Coastal Sustainability Standard'. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Over the past quarter century, the salmon aquaculture industry has grown rapidly. Price declines caused by the resulting worldwide increase in salmon production have severely impacted the salmon fishing industry, particularly in Alaska. In this paper, we examine the reasons behind the success of farm salmon. In addition to its inherent market advantages, farm salmon has benefitted from a legal structure that limits the ability of the fishing industry to adjust to competition. We look at these fisheries laws and at the impacts of various policy options on the future economic, ecological, and political sustainability of the fishing industry. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In many countries the sustainability of rural healthcare systems is being challenged by a shortage of rural physicians and difficulties in recruiting and retaining physicians in rural practice. There are numerous factors that influence efforts in rural physician recruitment and retention, many of which are beyond the scope of the academic medical centre and medical education. Nevertheless, there are strategies that medical schools can adopt to contribute to efforts to recruit and retain physicians in rural communities. Rural student recruitment, admissions policies, rural-oriented medical curriculum, rural practice learning experiences, faculty values and attitudes, and advanced procedural skills training are areas which the medical school has direct control of and which have been shown to influence the likelihood of medical students entering rural primary care practice. The purpose of this paper is to elaborate on some of the key strategies that have been identified in the literature.

ID VEGETATION
AB By combining research on individual forage plants and plant communities, significant information about the changing condition of rangelands under specific management practices can be produced; this has rarely been done to date. On the one hand, studies on individual plants provide rather mechanistic, isolated insights, making it impossible to identify interactions and the properties of plant communities relevant for adequate vegetation management. On the other hand, plant community analysis alone only reveals shifts in the composition of species and biomass, but does not explain cause-and-effect relationships related to the impact of grazing at species level. The combined and participatory approach suggested in this paper describes how a more tangible, quantifiable relationship can be established between individual plant and community level processes. Such an approach, which involves herders in expert assessment and data collection, enables better monitoring and forecasting of those changes in plant community composition that are relevant for livestock husbandry and sustainable resource use. In this study, the highest dry matter production (DMP) was recorded at altitudes between 1200 m (with 1945 kg/ha) and 1600 m (with 1921 kg/ha). In "freely grazed rangeland"-where access is riot limited and no manual improvement measures are taken-the proportion of palatable forage species is much lower than in "fenced rangeland," where access is limited and the stocking rate reduced to one third. Such integrated assessment of rangeland conditions ultimately provides the baseline for evaluating changes in ecosystems over time; it also provides a sound basis for negotiation among stakeholders with different interests.

AB Agricultural sustainability problems related to soil erosion and fertility depletion have arisen throughout the agroecological. one of Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK). Introduction and exploitation of clover is predicted to be beneficial and useful under these conditions because of its potential for herbage production, N-2 fixation, and soil cover characteristics. A 1-year field study with a local ecotype of white clover was carried out. Vegetative growth, herbage yield, nitrogen (N) uptake, and soil N content were investigated. Additionally, Rhizobia infestation was studied by isolating Rhizobia in culture media. The annual herbage yield (fresh fodder) of clover, and of clover and grass mixture harvested twice during the season was 7-15 t/ha while dry matter production was 3-6 t/ha. Protein content of white clover was 16% as compared to 5% in the indigenous grass species, demonstrating the superior feed value of white clover. The development of Rhizobium colonies in the culture media and the presence of about 20 nodules per plant indicated the purity of Rhizobium and its N2 fixing potential. The N content of clover and clover and grass mixture was 2-2.5% compared to 0.87% for grass alone, showing that clover was able to fix an average of 77 kg N/ha, a very encouraging figure even under low moisture conditions. A 70% increase in total soil N in clover-growing plots relative to control plots was observed. It was concluded that white clover can easily be grown and established in the hilly areas of Rawalakot, and would sustain a high level of pasture production and provide inputs of N through N-2 fixation which, in turn, would increase the productivity potential of soils in mountain eco-regions in AJK.

ID PERFORMANCE
AB Food security and sustainable development require efficient use of water resources, especially in irrigation. Economic pricing can be an effective tool to achieve more efficient water use, provided it is supported by other policies in implementation. Applying various water pricing and cost recovery arrangements is suggested for efficient allocation. Any adverse impact on farmers' incomes must be addressed and more reliable service must accompany higher prices. Experience from several countries suggests a variety of implementation issues. Essential complements to water pricing are water distribution rules and technological choices at critical nodes in the delivery system that allow farmers flexibility in conserving water in response to higher prices. Among supporting institutions, water users associations seem a higher priority than water markets.

AB Informal mining activities provide livelihoods for millions of poor in mineral-rich developing countries. Yet, they continue to remain one of the least understood areas in mineral resource management. While its poverty reduction potential is acknowledged, the heterogeneous forms of mining that come under its purview are not well discussed. This article aims to draw attention to the politics of definition by briefly introducing the reader to the nomenclature currently used to describe such mining activities. Then the article examines the nature of informality that justifies the name, and then illustrates the claim by documenting a range of informal mining practices in India with cited examples from other Asian countries. It illustrates the variations in social-economic, technical and legal characteristics, by putting such mining in a community and participatory framework. Finally, the article discusses ways to move towards sustainable development with community participation in mineral-rich areas of developing countries.

AB Ecohealth is a process for identifying key environmental determinants causing mortality or morbidity and combating them by mobilizing multiple social sectors. Evolving out of the concept of environmental health, ecohealth provides a framework for long-term sustainability. The health outcomes anticipated by environmental interventions are part of a long-term agenda and require fundamental groundwork for the growth of community-driven development. Building long-term sustainability requires that two key approaches be developed through ecohealth. The first is the strengthening of local community institutions, whether formal or informal. The second is building financial mechanisms that are more diversified and less reliant on a single donor. As a result, the ecohealth system provides an opportunity,for foundations to empower communities, build cross-cutting cooperation, and gain knowledge through projects. If people's environmental behaviour is to change and be sustained in the long term to produce desired health outcomes, this will require all members of society to be capable of functioning within the existing institutional infrastructure. This means that not only do formal institutions need to become more accessible but also that concepts relating to local informal institutions must be incorporated into ecohealth projects. It is imperative that we identify and understand relevant local institutions and how they can be transformed so that new environmental forms of behaviour can be sustained and result in positive health outcomes. The intersection of environmental and health concerns provides an ideal area in which the gap between government and civil society can be bridged - not only providing solutions to ecohealth concerns, but building government capacity in general and making these positive changes sustainable in the long term. This article is a case study, based on several United Nations Foundation grants. It outlines the significance of traditional community organizations, the breadth of their long-term relations with communities, their resources, and the adoption of sustained forms of behaviour. In addition, the article highlights the role that international foundations can play in creating innovative financing mechanisms through community-based,foundations.

AB Long-term declines in the productivity of pharmaceutical R&D threaten the sustainability of the current business model. A major driver of the decline has been the rising cost, and increased rate of failure, of projects across the industry, caused in part by the confluence of new approaches, novel technologies, higher go/no-go hurdles and organizational challenges. Here we examine several of the top culprits that are charged with driving this decline and the merits of the cases against them, and speculate on the emerging trends that will underpin the industry's future productivity.

DE fertilizer survey; North China Plain; nutrient accumulation; nutrient
   balance; soil fertility; vegetable production
AB A survey on current fertilizer practices and their effects on soil fertility and soil salinity was conducted from 1996 to 2000 in Beijing Province, a major vegetable production area in the North China Plain. Inputs of the major nutrients (NPK) and fertilizer application methods and sources for different vegetable species and field conditions were evaluated. Excessive N and P fertilizer application, often up to about 5 times the crop requirement in the case of N, was very common, especially for high-value crops. Potassium supply may have been inadequate for some crops such as leafy vegetables. Urea, diammonium orthophosphate ((NH4)(2)HPO4) and chicken manure were the major nutrient sources for vegetable production in the region. Over 50% of N, 60% of P and nearly 90% of K applied originated from organic manure. Total N application rate for open-field Chinese cabbage from organic manure and inorganic fertilizers ranged from 300 to 900 kg N ha(-1) on 78% of the farms surveyed. More than 35% of the surveyed greenhouse-grown tomato crops received >1000 kg N ha(-1) from organic and inorganic sources. A negative K balance (applied K minus K removed by the crop) was found in two-thirds of the surveyed fields of open-field Chinese cabbage and half of the surveyed fields of greenhouse-grown tomato. Plant-available N, P and K increased with increasing length of the period the greenhouse soils had been used for vegetable production. Similarly, soil salinity increased more in greenhouse soils than in open-field soils. The results indicate that balanced NPK fertilizer use and maintenance of soil quality are important for the development of sustainable vegetable production systems in this region.

AB Single isolates of bacterial endophytes, isolated from the nematode antagonistic plant species African (Tagetes erecta L.) and French (T patula L.) marigold, were introduced into potatoes (Solanum tuberosum L.). Several bacterial species possessed activity against root-lesion nematodes (Pratylenchus penetrans) in soils around the root zone of potatoes, namely: Microbacterium esteraromaticum, Tsukamurella paurometabolum, isolate TP6, Pseudomonas chlororaphis, Kocuria varians and K. kristinae. Of these, M. esteraromaticum and K. varians depressed the population densities of root-lesion nematodes without incurring any yield penalty (tuber wet weight). No significant differences were found in the total numbers of R penetrans nematodes, rhabditid nematodes or 'other' parasitic nematode species within the root tissues of bacterized potato plants compared to the unbacterized check. Overall, tuber fresh weights and tuber number were equal to or significantly lower (P less than or equal to 0.05) in bacterized plants than their unbacterized counterpart. We conclude that endoroot bacteria from Tagetes spp. can play a role in nematode suppression through the attenuation of nematode proliferation. We propose that these nematode control properties are capable of transfer to other crops in a rotation as a beneficial 'residual' microflora - a form of beneficial microbial allelopathy.

AB Indigenous forest fragments in rural New Zealand are increasingly valued as reservoirs of native biodiversity. Most forest species are adapted to soils of low phosphorus (P) availability, but fragments are often intermingled with managed pastures and subjected to unintended P inputs from aerial topdressing, which may compromise their long-term sustainability. Phosphorus availability and other nutrients in forest fragments were compared with adjacent fertilised pasture and reference forest areas not receiving fertiliser additions. Inorganic (H2SO4 soluble) P and available (Olsen) P were approximately ten times greater in fragment forest soils than reference forest soils, while total P was two times greater. The strong linear relationship between total P and cadmium, an element contained in rock phosphate fertilisers, suggested that the increased P levels in fragment forests could be attributed to P from aerial topdressing. Comparison of foliar N:P ratios show that P is being conserved in reference forests but not in fragment forest. A 5-fold increase in P mineralisation rate in forest fragments high in available P and a significant relationship between total P in forests and soil respiration suggests P availability may be limiting microbial activity in these forest systems. Forest Fragments also had base saturation and Ca, Mg, and K levels twice that of reference forests. Increased nutrient levels have been shown to alter plant successional dynamics and community composition, and raise concerns over future successional patterns and long-term stability of these forest fragments.

AB A protocol for rapid and efficient plant regeneration from protoplasts of red cabbage was developed by a novel nurse culture method. When the protoplasts of red cabbage were cultured in modified MS medium containing various combinations of BA, NAA and 2,4-D, they did not continue dividing due to browning. However, they successfully divided and formed micro-calli at a high efficiency when they were mixed and co-cultured with those of tuber mustard at a 1:1 ratio. The presence of tuber mustard protoplasts used as nurse cells was essential for sustainable divisions and colony formation of red cabbage protoplasts. Red cabbage-like plantlets were regenerated from these protoplast-derived calli at a frequency ranging from 33 to 56% in all the experiments where three cultivars of red cabbage were tested. Over 120 protoplast-derived cabbage plants were transferred to the greenhouse, and they showed no noticeable abnormalities in morphological features. Chromosome observation revealed that all of the plants examined had the normal chromosome number of cabbage (2n = 18), suggesting that no spontaneous fusion between the two species had occurred during protoplast culture.

AB Foliar blight caused by Cochliobolus sativus and Pyrenophora tritici-repentis is the main biotic stress of wheat in the rice-wheat systems of South Asia, where it causes, on average, up to 15% yield loss. Increases in food production have to come from higher and sustainable productivity. It requires a multidisciplinary approach combining novel resistance sources and adapted agronomic practices. Better host plant resistance has been achieved by crossing genetic resistance sources or wild relatives to high-yielding cultivars. Germ plasm improvement methods centered on regional partnerships are now more specifically addressing the needs of warmer areas. Observations in long-term trials underline the increasing role of soil fertility in reducing disease severity. Studies focusing on the effect of stress conditions on disease development increase knowledge about the stability of resistance. This makes breeding more efficient and helps recommend better-adapted crop management practices. The adoption of reduced tillage methods and soil conservation practices imply farmers' direct participation in the research process. Foliar fungicide treatments are not a viable alternative for small farmers, but seed treatment may prove useful as part of an integrated disease management approach based on improved genetic resistance and good agronomy.

AB Background. Developing and evaluating interventions to influence students' opportunities for healthful choices has been a focus of school-based health promotion research; however, few studies have examined the sustainability of these programs and viability of continued organizational implementation.
   Methods. The purpose of this study was to determine the maintenance of Child and Adolescent Trial for Cardiovascular Health (CATCH) school-level changes in former intervention (n = 56) and former comparison (n = 20) schools 5 years post-intervention. Twelve schools unexposed to CATCH were measured as controls. Macronutrient content of 5 days of school lunch menus, amount and type of physical education (PE) classes, and health instruction practices in the classroom were assessed. An institutionalization score for schools was developed, using program maintenance variables: % kcal from fat and saturated fat in school lunches, % PE class spent in vigorous and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, and class time devoted to CATCH topics.
   Results. Menus from 50% of former intervention cafeterias met the Eat Smart guidelines for fat, compared to 10% of former control cafeterias and 17% of unexposed school cafeterias (P < 0.005). There were no significant differences in implementation of CATCH PE goals between conditions. Although the total time spent teaching CATCH was low in former CATCH schools, the former intervention schools spent significantly more time teaching CATCH and taught more lessons as compared to former comparison schools. Former intervention schools had a higher mean institutionalization score than former comparison schools (P < 0.001). Training had the greatest impact on maintenance of CATCH.
   Conclusions. Results from this study suggest that changes in the school environment to support healthful behaviors can be maintained over time. Staff training is an important factor in achieving institutionalization of these programs. (C) 2004 The Institute For Cancer Prevention and Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Boston's massive: jacked tunnels set new benchmark

AB British tunnel-jacking expertise contributed to savings of over US$300 million on the vast project to build Boston's new subterranean highway network.The change from traditional cut-and-cover construction to tunnel jacking in frozen ground enabled three full-size interstate highway tunnels-totalling over 240 m in length-to be built in heavily obstructed ground under the approaches to a busy railway station with no disruption to service.The scale of the work was unprecedented, being several times larger than any tunnel-jacking project previously undertaken. It has set a new benchmark for the technique and further raised its profile as an effective and sustainable solution for creating new urban infrastructure.

AB Removing, dismantling and recycling the world's largest steel gravity platform has proved that the energy industry can safely and sustainably decommission its vast offshore infrastructure when the oil runs out, Nearly 100% of the 110 000 t Maureen platform and its associated 9000 t loading column was either re-used or recycled-with major structural components being used to build new port facilities and 42 000 t of steel landed ashore for scrapping. This paper reports on the complex and delicate task of cleaning and progressively dismantling the vast structure in a Norwegian fjord. It was the final phase of a 150 million decommissioning project, which has now set a benchmark for over 200 other steel structures currently operating in the British sector of the North Sea.

AB The motor car has become more than a means of transport. Despite the high cost and dire road safety problems, the car has become a totem in our social grouping and a metaphor for our lifestyle aspirations. This did not happen by accident. It is the consequence of some 90 years of soft-selling and highly sophisticated marketing. This paper explores the techniques that the advertising profession uses, and touches upon their application in marketing sustainable transport modes.

AB Owing to the energy crisis and pollution problems of today, investigations have concentrated on decreasing fuel consumption and on lowering the concentration of toxic components in combustion products by using non-petroleum, renewable, sustainable and non-polluting fuels. While conventional energy sources such as natural gas, oil and coal are non-renewable, hydrogen and alcohol can be coupled to renewable and sustainable energy sources. The usage of a mixture of hydrogen and methane as a supplementary fuel to an alcohol-air mixture for spark ignition engines results in a considerable improvement in engine performance and in the reduction of the toxic components in exhaust gases in comparison with the conventional spark ignition gasoline engine. In tests, the gas comprising 40 per cent H-2 and 60 per cent CH4 by volume was added to alcohol as 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 per cent by mass. Operating test results for a range of compression ratio (CR) and equivalent ratio are presented. Gasoline fuel was used as a basis for comparison. The important improvement in methane addition reduced the specific fuel consumption (s.f.c.) and CO emission of alcohol engines. The performance of the engine is enhanced when relatively small amounts of hydrogen are present with methane. This improvement in performance, which is especially pronounced at operational equivalence ratios that are much leaner than the stoichiometric value, can be attributed largely to the faster and cleaner burning characteristics of hydrogen in comparison with methane or alcohol. Moreover, the addition of hydrogen decreases the s.f.c. of the engine. The possibility of an engine power quality adjustment has also been studied.

AB In this work we assess the pathways for environmental improvement by the coal utilization industry for power generation in Australia. In terms of resources, our findings show that coal is a long term resource of concern as coal reserves are likely to last for the next 500 years or more. However, our analysis indicates that evaporation losses of water in power generation will approach 1000 Gl (gigalitres) per year, equivalent to a consumption of half of the Australian residential population. As Australia is the second driest continent on earth, water consumption by power generators is a resource of immediate concern with regards to sustainability. We also show that coal will continue to play a major role in energy generation in Australia and, hence, there is a need to employ new technologies that can minimize environmental impacts. The major technologies to reduce impacts to air, water and soils are addressed. Of major interest, there is a major potential for developing sequestration processes in Australia, in particular by enhanced coal bed methane (ECBM) recovery at the Bowen Basin, South Sydney Basin and Gunnedah Basin. Having said that, CO2 capture technologies require further development to support any sequestration processes in order to comply with the Kyoto Protocol. Current power generation cycles are thermodynamic limited, with 35-40% efficiencies. To move to a high efficiency cycle, it is required to change technologies of which integrated gasification combined cycle plus fuel cell is the most promising, with efficiencies expected to reach 60-65%. However, risks of moving towards an unproven technology means that power generators are likely to continue to use pulverized fuel technologies, aiming at incremental efficiency improvements (business as usual). As a big picture pathway, power generators are likely to play an increasing role in regional development; in particular EcoParks and reclaiming saline water for treatment as pressures to access fresh water supplies will significantly increase.

AB In suckling herds, farmers' production projects lead to highly variable animal productivity and production temporal pattern. The objective of this paper was to analyse the advantage of the notion of breeding female productive trajectory to model herd functioning based on six case studies. In the first part, six managements related to breeding and replacement practices are presented in relation to different production projects. In the second part, the analysis of management indicates that it is aimed at either decreasing or increasing within herd diversity of female productive trajectories. In the third part, consequences for modelling herd functioning are reviewed. Models of herd functioning should take into account farmers' decision as well as female biological behaviour. To simulate herd performances, it is therefore necessary to represent the groups of females with the same productive behaviour and the switch of females between these groups too. The productive trajectory is both an indicator of the rule for culling and an indicator of performance. The interaction between the fanner's decisions and female biology means taking into account management delayed effects on the sustainability of breeding female stock.

AB Modern urban transportation systems continuously challenge, and are challenged by, the changing nature of 21st-century travel demand. Today, congestion is the norm in cities of the United States, and researchers and practitioners are seeking solutions to these problems. Urban commuting is identified as contributing to the suboptimal performance of transportation systems. This paper offers a review and critique of recent research on urban commuting, emphasizing geographical dimensions of this topic. Three broad areas of research related to urban commuting are discussed. These include (1) urban sustainability, (2) land use, and (3) geographic information systems (GIS). Major themes are examined in an effort to elicit thought on future geographic research. At the conclusion of the paper, summary remarks are provided and avenues for research are outlined.

ID COLLECTOR; ENERGY; GIS
AB The main object of this paper is the documentation and study of the main factors behind the spectacular diffusion of solar energy use for domestic hot water production in Greece. The time pattern of the diffusion of flat-plate solar collectors since its 'out of the blue' first appearance in 1974, shows that the diffusion rate grew exponentially at first, with the annual sales figure reaching 91,000 m(2) by 1980. A rate slow down in the early 1980s was followed by a brief period of explosive growth, with the annual sales figure reaching its peak value of more than 185,000 m(2) in mid-1980s. A rapid decline of the growth rate down to the present annual sales level followed. The installed solar collectors pattern has the characteristic form of an S-shape curve, representing the overall penetration of the flat-plate solar collector use for domestic hot water production in the Greek economy and society. This evolution has gone through an inflection point around 1987, i.e. at a time when about 1,000,000 m(2) Of Col- lectors had been already installed. By the year 2000, about 2,070,000 m(2) of collectors had been installed, with a tendency to level off by 2010, unless some of the present conditions determining this phenomenon change.

TI Environmental optimization in fractionating industrial wastes using

SO RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
LA English
DT Article
DE integrated industrial waste management; waste fractionating
   optimization; cost-benefit analysis
AB This paper proposes that industrial waste be regarded, in a business economic sense, as having the same basic status as regular products. A basic mathematical expression for assigning industrial costs to waste is presented. The expression can be employed in conjunction with cost-benefit analysis for estimating the "true" internal costs of industrial waste. In two case studies presented, industrial waste was found to have a substantial negative impact on profits. This is seen as a possibly unavoidable consequence of industrial companies' acting in accordance with the ideal of improving the sustainability and productivity of resource use.

DT Article
DE fertility; soil reaction; salinity
AB The alluvial soil of the Assuncao Island, in the Sao Francisco River, Cabrobo, State of Pernambuco, Brazil, has been intensively cultivated with annual crops under irrigation. The present yields are unsatisfactory due to the use of inadequate agricultural practices that are not sustainable. This study aimed to survey the soil chemical properties in an area of 1,131 ha by collecting 1,053 samples in the 0-0.30 m surface soil layer. The samples were analyzed for chemical properties and the data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. The obtained results indicated that there was higher variability for aluminum, potassium and phosphorus concentration and for the percentage of sodium saturation. The lowest variability was observed for soil pH. The data did not present a normal distribution. Most soil samples presented low aluminum, organic matter, and phosphorus concentrations. The soil pH, CEC, calcium, magnesium, and potassium concentration were interpreted as appropriate for most crops and were classified as normal regarding the percentage of sodium saturation.

AB Policy makers are confronted with the question of how to combine sustainable flood protection and floodplain rehabilitation in the best possible way. Both topics deal with spatial planning aspects in a range of scales. This question was the starting point for the development of an evaluation method within the IRMA/SPONGE project INTERMEUSE, illustrated on the basis of assumed flood protection strategies in the Meuse river basin (the 'sponge' strategy, the 'retention' strategy, and the 'floodplain lowering' or 'winter bed' strategy). The integration of flood protection and floodplain rehabilitation can be performed on two scale levels that are interrelated: on the regional level the focus is on (large parts of) an entire stream basin; on the local level specific site conditions are taken as starting point. Ecological aspects under study are spatial cohesion of habitats as identified by species population persistence modelling (regional, longitudinal level) and required habitat quality for carabid beetles and for meadow vegetation gradients as assessed by correspondence analysis (local, transversal level). The carabid beetles are taken as indicative for the ecological integrity of the river bed, the meadow vegetation for that of the floodplain.
   A unifying concept in the evaluation of ecological integrity is the ecological minimum: the critical boundary or minimum level of habitat conditions for a potentially good ecological functioning. It is the least acceptable state for a river ecosystem that is still functional to some extent, compared to a natural river ecosystem. The results of this study show clearly that there is a good chance to combine floodplain rehabilitation aims with flood protection activities, both on a local and on an international scale. Although ecological effect assessment and ecological optimizing (referring to a natural reference state) remain basic, additionally the assessment of the ecological minimum helps to define design strategies for integrated flood protection, especially in situations where there is an opportunity for river rehabilitation.

AB Assessing actual and potential biodiversity of river-floodplain ecosystems on the basis of policy and legislation concerning endangered and protected species is necessary for consistency between different policy goals. It is thus a prerequisite to sustainable and integrated river management. This paper presents BIO-SAFE, a transnational model that quantifies the relevance of species and ecotopes, characteristic of the main channels and floodplains of the rivers Rhine and Meuse, on the basis of international treaties and directives and national Red Data Lists. BIO-SAFE was developed into a tool for biodiversity assessment with regard to design and evaluation of physical planning projects, Environmental Impact Assessments and comparative landscape-ecological studies. It was conceived to be applicable in Germany, France, Belgium and the Netherlands.
   Taxonomic groups involved are higher plants, birds, herpetofauna, mammals, fish, butterflies, and dragonflies and damsel-flies. The linkage of habitat requirements of species to ecotopes allows the user to derive information at the level of several ecotope types and scales. The model requires input data on presence of species and/or surface area of ecotopes. BIO-SAFE has been applied to flood risk reduction projects along the rivers Rhine and Meuse. Results show that BIO-SAFE yields quantitative information regarding the degree to which actual situations, reconstruction designs and developments of species and ecotope composition meet national and international agreements on biodiversity conservation.
   Attuning biodiversity conservation and flood risk reduction measures is a major issue in applied ecology and spatial planning. Assessments with BIO-SAFE can help find an optimal balance. Because of its policy-based character, BIO-SAFE yields information that is complementary to ecological biodiversity indices, single-species habitat models and ecological network analysis. The development of BIO-SAFE was based on species characteristic of rivers and floodplains, but the method can easily be applied to other ecosystems as well. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

SO RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS
LA English
DT Article
DE Rhine; Meuse; flood risk management strategies; flood control measures;
   spatial planning
AB Recent flood events in western Europe have shown the need for improved flood risk management along the Rhine and Meuse rivers. In response, the IRMA-SPONGE research programme was established, consisting of 13 research projects, in which over 30 organizations from six countries co-operated. The aim of IRMA-SPONGE was 'the development of methods and tools to assess the impact of flood risk reduction measures and of land-use and climate change scenarios, in order to support the spatial planning process for the Rhine and Meuse River Basins'. Several important conclusions were agreed upon by participants in the programme; they emphasize the role of spatial planning, especially in areas at risk of flooding, as an important component of flood risk management:
   1. Flood risk, defined as a function of both flood probability and potential damage, is increasing not only due to climate change (likely to cause an increase in the probability of extreme discharges) but also due to continued investment in areas at risk of flooding (resulting in an increase in potential damage).
   2. Water retention areas and land-use adaptations far upstream may be useful in lowering the frequency of floods in small basins. However, extreme floods far downstream in the lower Rhine and Meuse basins, where the probability of design discharges is less than 1/200 per year, cannot be prevented by such upstream measures.
   3. The most effective and sustainable reduction of flood risks could be achieved by reducing the potential damage (vulnerability) in flood-prone areas through adapted land use and spatial planning.
   4. Flood risk management organizations should not only aim at a reduction of flood risk but should also seek to enhance the ecological quality of rivers and floodplains. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB The sustainability of the rice (Oryza sativa L.)-wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) rotation is important to Asia's food security. Intensive cropping with no return of crop residues and other organic inputs result in the loss of soil organic matter (SOM) and nutrient supply, and is assumed to be nonsustainable. We evaluated seven treatments comprised of various combinations of green manure (GM; Sesbania cannabina L.); wheat straw (WS), farmyard manure (FYM), and urea on yields and yield trends; P and K balance; and soil fertility in a rice-wheat experiment (1988-2000) on a loamy sand in Punjab, India. Rice yields were comparable with GM + urea, WS + GM + urea, and urea alone, but yields were reduced when FYM was supplemented with N. Except during 1 yr, integrated use of FYM and GM produced equal or higher rice yields than other GM based treatments. Wheat straw incorporation reduced average rice yields by 7% compared with WS removal. After 5 yr of continuous application, FYM and WS were at par in increasing rice yields. Organic materials applied to rice had no residual effect on wheat yields except FYM, which increased yield by about 6% compared with urea alone. Rice yield declined by 0.02 to 0.13 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) but wheat yields remained unchanged. Soil C increased with the application of WS and FYM. Potassium balance was highly negative. Although the causes of yield decline are unknown, inadequate K applications and changes in the climatic parameters are possible reasons.

AB Soil erosion and moisture stress are the major problems for crop production and sustainable land management in Ethiopia. This study was conducted to determine whether incorporation of crop residues modifies the physical properties of the surface soil by increasing water infiltration and storage, decreasing evaporation rate, and improving soil tilth. The effect of maize (Zea mays L.) residues incorporated at a rate of 6 Mg ha(-1) (with inorganic fertilizer (RF) and without (R)) were compared to applying inorganic fertilizer alone (F) and a control (C) on two soil types (a Mollic Andosol with sandy loam texture and a Dystric Nitosol with clayey texture) in the South Central Rift Valley of Ethiopia.
   After three (annual) residue incorporations, penetration resistance at the 10 cm depth of both soils and shear resistance at the 5 cm depth of the sandy loam soil were 22-52% lower in the RF and R treatments than in the C treatment. The macro-plus mesoporosity in the RF treatment of the sandy loam soil (0-7 cm depth) was 22% higher compared to that of the C treatment. Evaporative flux (0-20cm depth) in the RF and R treatments of the sandy loam soil and in the R treatment of the clayey soil were lower compared to the C treatment by 39-57%. The results indicate that incorporating crop residues, especially in conjunction with the use of inorganic fertilizers, can improve rain water use efficiency and soil tilth. This will also have a direct effect in minimizing the rate of soil erosion in the area. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE ngoro cultivation system; conservation; cost-benefits; grain yield;
   labour productivity; pit size; soil moisture; surface roughness index
AB The Matengo people, in SW Tanzania, developed the ngoro conservation system several hundred years ago and it is a very effective indigenous manual cultivation practice for steep slopes. It deserves wider recognition and investigation to gain a quantitative understanding of the conservation system processes and its management to see whether it can be adapted to be more cost effective with limited land and labour resources. The objective of the study was to evaluate the effects of pit size in the ngoro cultivation system on soil water conservation and yield of maize (Zea mays L.). A field experiment was conducted in 1995/1996 at two sites near Lipumba village on the Matengo highlands in Mbinga District, Ruvuma Region, in southern Tanzania. The ngoro comprise a matrix of pits with surrounding bund walls and this indigenous system is used extensively on the steep slopes (typically 20-50%) of Mbinga District. Grass is cut prior to cultivation and laid out in a matrix, traditionally about 1.5 m x 1.5 m square, soil is then dug from the middle of each square and placed to cover the cut grass to form four bunds surrounding each pit. Crops are planted on these bund walls (ridges), under which buried decomposing plant residues provide nutrients and also ingeniously allow seepage of excessive water across the ngoro system. The ngoro pit size treatments comprised N-1 (1 m x 1 m), N-1.5 (1.5 m x 1.5 m) and N-2 (2 m x 2 m) laid in a randomised complete block design with four replications. Although ngoro profiles were degraded over time, the net loss of soil from the system was negligible as the majority of soil was redeposited in the pit. N-2 was found to be the most suitable pit size on steep slopes. Pit size did not significantly influence the soil moisture regime as measured in this study. Increase in pit size generally resulted in decreased soil penetration resistance and improved plant growth resulting in the highest grain yield being obtained from the 2 m x 2 m ngoros. Increasing the pit size reduced labour input requirements and thereby markedly boosted the profitability of the system. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SO SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
LA English
DT Article
AB Alepidea, amatymbica is a heavily traded medicinal plant species in KwaZulu-Natal facing the threat of local extirpation because harvesting of rhizomes usually results in plant death. Its population status in the southern Drakensberg was compared among conservation, communal and private (variable harvesting pressure) grasslands. Alepidea amatymbica was restricted to rocky slopes of southerly aspect. It was abundant in Coleford Nature Reserve and in adjacent protected private properties but was absent from the immediately adjacent Ndwana communal area, and had nearly been eliminated on other accessible private properties. Harvesting does not appear to be sustainable, but recommendations for sustainable harvesting are thwarted by a lack of basic natural history knowledge.

ID RESERVE SELECTION ALGORITHMS; CAPE FLORISTIC REGION; SPECIES RICHNESS;

   LAND; BIODIVERSITY; GRADIENTS
AB Few studies have investigated the ability of national conservation networks to adapt to changes in underlying environmental drivers (such as precipitation) and their consequences for factors such as human density and species richness patterns. In this article, the South African avifauna is used as the basis for such analysis to ascertain the likely extent of current, and future, anthropogenic impacts on priority conservation areas. We show that human population pressure is high in or around most of these priority areas and is likely to increase, given the magnitude of post-climate change estimated from predicted changes in precipitation and relationships between species richness, human densities, and rainfall. Although additional conservation areas, such as the Important Bird Area (IBA) network, are likely to introduce valuable flexibility to conservation management, only limited options are available for such expansions, and the conservation value of these areas is likely to be compromised by changing climate. Ultimately, a more integrated conservation approach is needed for effective conservation policies. Such an approach should confer adequate protection on current reserves and emphasize sustainable utilization of non-reserve areas.

DT Article
AB Company experience is that environmental constraints are throttling business progress. Pressures from legislation, insurance, finance and stakeholders, who all demand evidence of environmental excellence, are ever increasing. At the same time, the economic system is driving business in a predominantly unsustainable direction. In view of this dilemma, the need for a practical methodology enabling the full implementation of sustainable development into business cannot be overstated.
   Central to all this is a clear definition of what sustainable development means for industry in practice; how sustainable processing can be applied from first principles and the adoption of total sustainability as the ultimate goal.
   This paper aims to. clarify the important issues involved in practical sustainable development and to assemble the elements of a practical methodology. or toolkit, for the attainment of total sustainability in business. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

ID ENVIRONMENT
AB Sustainable development is based on the integration of four dimensions: the economic, the environmental, the social and the institutional. For the economic dimension in particular, growth has been considered an essential element of sustainable development. This paper discusses the relationship of social, environmental and institutional sustainability objectives to economic growth and derives social and environmental criteria for growth to be sustainable.
   One of the most sophisticated sustainability studies developed for Germany is introduced, demonstrating the need and the possibility to reconcile economic, social, environmental and institutional objectives. Integrated politics taking into account all four dimensions when drafting policy plans are a necessary precondition for this behalf.
   Based on two sustainability scenarios with a different emphasis (growth, integration) five core action zones for policy making are identified. The criteria derived can be used as yardsticks assessing policy proposals at an early stage regarding their impact on key sustainability objectives.

AB Although industrial economies depend on natural resources to fulfil fundamental societal needs and to improve quality of life, increasing exploitation of these resources is exerting increasing pressure on our planet's ecological integrity. This paper, focusing on construction minerals, establishes a mass balance framework for the chosen case study - the North West of England - and uses the results to examine the implications for the sustainability of the region. The authors contend that a better understanding of the regional flow of materials, and the impact of human activity on surrounding ecosystems, will help to underpin informed decision-making.

TI The development and use of farm-level indicators in England
SO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB In recent years the concept of 'sustainability indicators' has become important within agricultural policy development. However, as policy tools, many indicators are highly technical in nature and often appear relevant only at national level. Consequently, the key messages underpinning the indicators can easily become lost at farm level.
   In order to drive progress towards sustainability it is important to define indicators at a level that is meaningful to the target audience and that encapsulates the spatial and temporal diversity of the farm environment.
   In support of policy-objectives the pilot national set of indicators of agricultural sustainability has been re-cast into indicators that can be collected, interpreted and compared at a farm level. A software package that prioritizes the indicators according to farm type and 9 that links trends with farm management decisions and practices, identifying steps for improvements, is used as the main means of knowledge transfer.

ID DESIGN
AB This paper presents a retrospective synthesis and a prospective exploration of an intact line of inquiry that was inspired by the scholarly work of our mentor Bela H. Banathy. The inquiry centers on the creation of the conditions for the conscious evolution of humanity in partnership with earth. Initially, it focused on the notion of Evolutionary Learning Community (ELC) as the vehicle of choice for the creation of a 'Design Culture' that would promote learning, collaboration, innovation, and sustainability across different sectors of society. ELC serves to empower various forms of community to engage in self-directed sustainable development. It does so by fostering attention to a systemic variety of dimensions that assure wholeness and interconnections at both individual and collective levels of development for present and future generations. Application of the ELC framework in diverse contexts-such as business corporations, non-profit organizations, and civil society-naturally leads to consideration of the synergy and interrelations that arise in the evolutionary transformations that occur in different settings. Therefore, the inquiry has expanded to embrace issues of Evolutionary Development-that is, inquiry on ELC and other initiatives that support, facilitate, catalyze, and enhance self-organization for the creation of global sustainable learning societies. This paper articulates the relation between learning and development from a systemic and evolutionary perspective. Conscious evolution is defined and explored in the context of the evolution of education, business, and society. The paper ends with a description of the implications of this line of inquiry for further research and action. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB This paper documents a decade of thinking and practice inspired by Bela H. Banathy and his work on collaborative systems design. I first met Bela in 1994 at the annual conference of the International Society for the Systems Sciences (ISSS), where he invited me to discuss my recently launched dissertation project on the history and social implications of general systems theory. In my research on the founders of ISSS, I was particularly inspired by Kenneth Boulding's emphasis on the critical role of dialogue in decision making. I am currently a faculty member in Hutchins School of Liberal Studies at Sonoma State University, which offers an interdisciplinary seminar-based program, embodying the spirit of both Boulding's and Banathy's work. It has provided an excellent laboratory for practicing the art of interdisciplinary dialogue, which extends into the larger community in a variety of ways. In this paper, I offer examples of dialogue and design in action, inspired and enriched through my acquaintance with Bela. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB Bioregional planning processes, which employ an essentially holistic view of the environment as far as current and proposed land-use practices are concerned, are justifiably gaining ground worldwide. This is also true for South Africa, a country that harbours remarkably rich biota. The concept of bioregional planning prominently includes aspects such as informed conservation planning and the sustainable use of biodiversity, among a range of other equally important environmental considerations. This paper argues that support of on-going, basic taxonomic studies in bioregions are critically important to ensure the comprehensive and accurate documentation and inventorying of biodiversity at any scale. As such, taxonomists fulfill an essential role in the initial and follow-up phases of bioregional planning processes. Insufficient attention to checklisting activities will severely hamper the implementation of workable bioregional plans.

DE technology diffusion; diffusion orbit; Lotka-Volterra equations;
   competitive innovations; optimal policy option
AB Successful innovation and diffusion of technology can be attributed to the identification of the orbit of emerging new technologies that complement or substitute for existing technologies. This dynamism resembles the co-evolution process in an ecosystem. In an ecosystem, in order to maintain sustainable development, the complex interplay between competition and cooperation, typically observed in predator-prey systems, create a sophisticated balance. Given that an ecosystem can be used as a masterpiece system, this sophisticated balance can provide suggestive ideas for identifying an optimal orbit of competitive innovations with complement or substitution dynamism.
   Prompted by such a sophisticated balance in an ecosystem, this paper analyzes the optimal orbit of competitive innovations and, on the basis of an application of Lotka-Volterra equations, it reviews substitution orbits of Japan's monochrome to color TV system, fixed telephones to cellular telephones, cellular telephones to mobile Internet access service, and analog to digital TV broadcasting. On the basis of substitution orbits analyses, it attempts to extract suggestions supportive to identifying an optimal policy option in a complex orbit leading to expected orbit.
   Key findings include policy options that are effective in controlling parameters for Lotka-Volterra equations leading to expected orbit. (C) 2002 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID SPRAY IRRIGATION; QUALITY; SOIL
AB From an ecological point of view it is important to close nutrient cycles by recirculating mineral nutrients from the urban society back to agriculture and forestry, and thereby obtaining a sustainable resource utilisation. A part of this cycle is illustrated by irrigation of bioreactor landfill leachates on short rotation forests. This paper presents a budget for nutrients and heavy metals, beginning with the leachates and ending with the harvested tree fraction. The hypotheses were: The applied minerals deliver nutrients to the trees. The nutrient content in the accumulating biomass corresponds to the amount of mineral nutrients applied. The concentrations of heavy metals in the trees will remain low. The uptake of elements in birch was for P 35%, Ca 1.2%, Cd 64%, Cu 10%, Mn 19%, Ni 0.11%, and for Zn 26% of the supplied amounts. It was concluded that nutrients, with some exceptions, are supplied in sufficient amounts from the irrigated leachates to achieve optimal biomass growth, that the amounts of ions immobilised by the plants were significantly lower compared to the applied amounts, and that the concentrations of heavy metals are not increasing in the trees after irrigation. The overall conclusion is that a leachate irrigation system is efficient if the available vegetated land area is large enough for effective nutrient uptake, but the nutrient ratio may need to be balanced to meet the needs of the plants.

DE ecological improvement; fuzzy logic; no-deterioration; sustainable
   consenting; Water Framework Directive
AB This paper describes the development of a guidance tool for assessing the ability of a receiving watercourse to assimilate pollution from point discharges. The 'sustainable capacity tool' uses a framework that accounts for the 'no-deterioration' requirement of the Water Framework Directive, in terms of the downgrading of a river-stretch classification and the requirement to return all rivers to 'good ecological status'. The second requirement results in a long-term set of river-quality targets or objectives, and it is generally assumed that 'good' refers to 'A2 quality' in the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency classification system. The resulting sustainable capacity is defined as the risk-based amount of capacity that could be allocated without causing a failure of the target class and which could also result in a negative capacity if the river stretch is currently failing the target class. This is plotted as a GIS layer and is intended to form an overview of water quality to help inform stakeholders who are participating in a water-quality strategy for the next Scottish investment programme on Quality and Standards 3. The sustainable capacity tool could be used in conjunction with integrated catchment modelling for complete management of the Water Framework Directive river-basin districts.

AB A horizontal wellpoint groundwater source was constructed to supply irrigation water to a golf course from a coastal dune-sands aquifer in an area which has vulnerable wetland habitats of European importance. The source was designed to abstract the required quantities with less drawdown, compared with that from a conventional vertical wellpoint system, thus reducing any potential threat to the nature-conservation sites. Pump testing of the source showed that the yield was more than adequate to meet the needs of the Golf Club and to allow efficient operation of the computer-controlled course irrigation system. Data from observation wells indicated that there was no drawdown beyond the golf-course boundaries and none of the nature-conservation sites would be affected. The horizontal wellpoint method, which has not been widely applied in the UK, could have wider applications for irrigation water users who need to abstract water from shallow aquifers.

AB A complete listing of the world's known plant species has long been considered desirable but has remained an elusive target for generations of botanists. The adoption of the Global Strategy for Plant Conservation has reinforced the urgent need for a global plant checklist to support, facilitate and monitor the conservation and sustainable use of plant diversity worldwide. The increasing availability of large databases of biological information over the Internet has demonstrated that many of the obstacles to the collation and dissemination of vast, shared datasets can be overcome. We examine the challenges that still remain to be addressed if the botanical community is to achieve its ambitious objective of delivering a working list of all known plant species by 2010.

AB A sustainable energy economy will be demanding primary energy sources, preferably renewable and mainly domestically available, using energy carriers, such as hydrogen and electricity, able to solve environmental problems and to assure adequate energy security. Instrumental to such goals will be the research and development of storage systems with performance characteristics compatible with major application requirements. Lithium or nickel are replacing lead in batteries, in order to better meet the extremely varying technical and economical requirements in fast growing conventional and new applications. Moreover, few technologies now permit to store hydrogen by modifying its physical state in gaseous or liquid form. The variety of hydrogen needs in the energy systems and in the vehicular sector is justifying the effort on solid state (metal hydrides and carbon nanostructures) or chemical systems (chemical hydrides). In this overview, emphasis is given to the major achievements in the field of electrical energy and hydrogen storage, in relation to the technological goals, which have been proposed in the major public research and collaborative programs throughout the world.

ID FUEL-CELL VEHICLES
AB The fast developing of fuel cell (FC) technologies has open a window to alternative energy sources such as natural gas, methanol, ethanol, or hydrogen. This paper outlines the prospects for a hydrogen economy in Mexico. If we consider a hydrogen economy in Mexico in the near future and if all the national energy could be produced by hydrogen, the country will require 46.5 million tons per year. By 2010, it would have approximately 3300 automobiles with fuel cells. In the initial phase of a "hydrogen economy", hydrogen could be produced from the current competitive fossil fuels. Hydrogen is a unique fuel with unmatched properties. In the Mexican hydrogen industry, we do not know yet how many tons of hydrogen per year are produced for the different uses of chemical production, oil refining, metal treating or electrical applications. At this moment, hydrogen national resources are 837.7 million tons, which reverts a huge potential in hydrocarbon resources. Hydrogen costs from natural gas are about three times the cost of the feedstock, thus US$ 6 feedstock gas would result in the hydrogen costing US$ 18 per million of Btu, which is equivalent to gasoline costing about US$ 2 per gallon.

AB The paper reviews how the concept of sustainable development has played out in industrialized countries since 1987. It examines the theory and practice of sustainable development in the context of three criticisms (it is vague, attracts hypocrites and fosters delusions), and argues for an approach to sustainability, that is integrative, is action-oriented, goes beyond technical fixes, incorporates a recognition of the social construction of sustainable development, and engages local communities in new ways. The paper concludes with a description of an approach to sustainability that attempts to incorporate these characteristics. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Snowmobiling growth in North America and Sweden creates challenges in "governing the commons." Snowmobiling contributes to the economy of distressed rural regions and enhances residents' quality of life; but quasi-open access to winter landscapes also breeds conflicts: among snowmobilers, with landowners, with other recreationists, and with environmentalists and ecosystem health. Common pool resource and impure public goods theories are used to interpret these conflicts and strategic interactions. Case studies in Sweden and Maine yield insights about conditions for sustainable management of multiple-use landscapes when property rights are complex and stakeholders diverse. The case studies utilize key informant interviews, tourist surveys, and a contingent valuation exercise to illustrate how innovative governance institutions, complemented by infrastructure investments, can mitigate conflicts, re-align incentives, and internalize costs. Local self-governance has evolved with state facilitation, but without changes in fundamental property law. Three keys are trail agreements between snowmobile clubs and landowners, clubs' norm formation and rule enforcement, and public-private investment in quality trails. These arrangements are strained by hot spot congestion, free riding, and unresolved conflicts with other recreationists. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Current emphasis on affordability and sustainability of manufacturing systems creates a need for new material process design methods that consider alternative materials and processes. The advent of low-cost, high-performance computing has enabled a generic acceptance of powerful computational tools such as finite element analysis (FEA) for analysis purposes. The large number of computations required by a high accuracy FEA simulation makes an optimization-based design technique that is built around FEA simulations almost prohibitive. Alternative simpler techniques are needed at the initial design stages in order to predict the most important characteristics of the material behavior during processing in a small fraction of time taken by an FEA run. The technique presented in this paper describes a volume-based mapping method for the parameter estimation in forging operations. The method can produce the deformed geometry and important process parameters such as strain and strain rate in matter of seconds. The results have been compared with a widely used FEA tool and the predictions are found to be in good agreement with FEA results. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   Application to typical crops in a semiarid region
SO AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT

ID IRRIGATION
AB The greatest water consumption takes place during irrigation of and and semiarid areas, therefore, water resource management is fundamental for sustainability. For correct management, several tools and decision-making systems are necessary while paying close attention to aspects such as profitability, water cost, etc. Water resources are scarce and some of them are of low quality. This extremely delicate situation occurs in some regions of the world and it explains increasing water cost. In Europe, the policies relating to water use (2000/60/EC) pay particular attention to the need of its protection and conservation. To ensure this, a large number of measures, including the establishment of prices which really correspond to their usage costs, have been set forth. Water subsidies are relatively important in all European countries. In this study, a specific methodology is applied to a Spanish semi-arid region. It is useful and easy to apply, not only by farmers, but also by water managers and politicians in charge of policy. The methodology also helps in the decision-making process about water cost in agriculture. In this area (Hydrogeological System 08.29, Spain), the resources are mainly underground water with a high variable cost and without any direct subsidies. This model allows us to analyse the effect of different water costs and to find the optimum strategy giving the maximum gross marg,,in in line with water cost and its main determining factors (irrigation system, climatic variability, etc.).
   The methodology is based on the effect of irrigation on crop yield with its production function, integrating the effect of application efficiency. In this way, a relationship between gross margin and gross irrigation depth is obtained. Working with permanent irrigation systems and four crops (barley, garlic, maize and onion), the main conclusion is that the optimum gross irrigation depths are always fewer than those necessary for maximum crop yield and when irrigation depths are fewer water cost increases. Irrigation depths, which maximise the economic efficiency in the use of water (e m(-3)), are fewer than those which maximise the gross margin; therefore, this aspect must be considered in irrigation scheduling. The results also show important differences among crops, depending on their water requirements and their economic profitability. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A validated agro-hydrological model soil water atmosphere plant (SWAP) was applied to formulate Guidelines for irrigation planning in cotton-wheat crop rotation using saline ground water as such and in alternation with canal water for sustainable crop production. Six ground water qualities (4, 6. 8. 10, 12 and 14dS/m), four irrigation schedules with different irrigation depths (4, 6, 8 and 10 cm) and two soil types (sandy loam and loamy sand) were considered for each simulation. The impact of the each irrigation scenario on crop performance, and salinization/desalinisation processes occurring in the soil profile (0-2 m) was evaluated through Water Management Response Indicators (WMRIs). The criterion adopted for sustainable crop production was a minimum of pre-specified values of ETrel (greater than or equal to0.75 and greater than or equal to0.65 for wheat and cotton, respectively) at the end of the 5th year of simulation corresponding to minimum deep percolation loss of applied water. The extended simulation study revealed that it was possible to use the saline water upto 14dS/m alternatively with canal water for cotton-wheat rotation in both sandy loam and loamy sand soils. In all situations pre-sown irrigation must be accomplished with canal water (0.3-0.4dS/m). Also when the quality of ground water deteriorates beyond 10 dS/m, it was suggested to use groundwater for post-sown irrigations alternately with canal water. Generally, percolation losses increased with the increase in level of salinity of ground water to account for leaching and thus maintain a favourable salt balance in the root zone to achieve pre-specified values of ETrel.

AB This study extends Bohn's (1998) model to the context of a small-open economy suffering from political and economic instabilities. A Markov-switching model is developed by incorporating a Bayesian Gibbs sampling simulation. The model is estimated for Turkish economy over the period of 1980-2001 to analyse the relationship between primary surpluses and government total liabilities. The main result of the study is that the relationship might be unstable due to the changes in intentions of the governments towards sustainability of fiscal policy.

AB Chemical process synthesis methods and tools developed over the last several decades have reached a level of maturity that have provided advantage to practitioners in an environment of increased costs and shrinking margins. Future growth within the chemical process industries is likely to involve even keener competition with greater impact from factors such as raw material and energy availability, climate change mitigation, sustainability, and inherent security. The future will probably see an expanded role for the systematic generation process synthesis paradigm, including an increased interdependency with process and catalytic chemistry on one hand and operability and control expertise on the other. Advances from artificial intelligence may inspire new process synthesis paradigms incorporating more effective representations of the underlying physical sciences and engineering art, new social concerns, new design strategies, and new computerized implementations. The future may also see a collaboration of the systematic generation and superstructure optimization process synthesis paradigms in which systematic generation is used to create the superstructure for simultaneous discrete and continuous variable optimization. As the resulting process designs will certainly be evaluated from additional points of view including social considerations, superstructure optimization will need to produce families of good designs for multi-criteria Pareto optimization. There are many challenges, but continued progress will be made and these challenges will be met. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The proposed study provides an analysis of an integrated co-generative scheme including the following subsystems: (1) gas turbine and unfired heat recovery steam generator, (2) auxiliary boiler, (3) multistage flash (MSF) and (4) reverse osmosis (RO). It contains a comparison of the integrated system with the reference scheme. A comparison of alternatives was based on the present values (PV) of expenses over the economic life of capital and "levelized" cost of water. The analysis was based on the following assumptions: (1) depreciation period is equal to the period of bank credit; (2) zero year is the base year of the project; (3) the discount factor is dependent upon the nominal interest rate and retail price index, (4) cost of primary fuel ranges from 1 to 4 $/GJ, (5) assumed carbon tax varies from 0 to $50 per tonne of emitted carbon. Based upon calculated results, the study confirmed the statement that RO can successfully coexist with MSF. Hybridisation of thermally- and electrically-driven processes can provide the following advantages: (1) a decrease of PV of expenses, (2) decrease of specific capital and energy consumption; (3) decrease of the level of carbon tax (owing to a drop of allocated CO(2) emissions); (4) decrease of "levelized" cost of water. Incorporation of RO into existing co-generative systems decreases its sensitivity and, in turn commercial risk of the system to fluctuation of the following factors: (1) nominal interest rate (2) cost of primary fuel and (3) rate of carbon tax. The array of calculated data and projections is attached.

AB The Organization of American States is supporting the project "Biosafety Regulations in Latin America and The Caribbean within the framework of the International Biosafety Protocol". The general objective is to strengthen national skills for the assessment and management of risks of biotechnology food products, and to build up public awareness about their benefits and risks in the participant countries, with the ultimate goal to promote their safe and sustainable use within a protective and trusting environment for the public. The first phase has been focused on the evaluation of the political and regulatory systems in Chile, Peru and Colombia, identification of needs, and development of a series of biosafety seminar-workshops in the three countries, with the participation of distinguished foreign experts. The second phase, which started in March 2003, has been extended to six countries of Central America and The Caribbean. The project is helping to identify the weaknesses and needs for the establishment of the biosafety protocol in each participating country. It has also establish the specific training needs and is given the bases for the design of general outlines of biosafety training plans, which will contribute to an efficient implementation of the International Biosafety Protocol. The project it is also allowing to coordinate actions between the countries for a better implementation of the protocol at a regional level. On the other hand, the project has allowed to assemble, around discussion tables, international experts with the main representatives of regulatory and academic institutions, business enterprises and NGOs, as well as with congressmen in scientific and technological matters and the protection of biodiversity. Thus, the project has permitted the establishment of cooperation linkages and has contributed to reinforce the notion of the importance of biosafety for national development and the preservation of local biodiversity.

   cumulative energy demand
AB The aim of the present paper is the comparison of electrodialysis (ED) and ion exchange (IE) with regard to their cumulative energy demand by means of two applications separating ions with significantly different molar weight. Data for the separation of sodium gluconate and for the desalination of whey are obtained from laboratory experiments. Therefrom, a scale-up is done to an industrial-scale plant, which has been verified for the desalination of whey by comparison with data from a commercial plant. The obtained cumulative energy demands consist of the specific energy demand for the transport of ions across the membranes, for pumping, and for the waste-water treatment in the case of ED, and of the specific energy demand for pumping, for the production of regenerants, and for the waste-water treatment in the case of IE. Applying ED, cumulative energy demands of 97 and 91.7 Wh/mol result for the separation of sodium gluconate and for the desalination of whey, respectively. With IE, cumulative energy demands of 291.1 and 190.5 Wh/mol result for the separation of sodium gluconate and for the desalination of whey, respectively. Thus, ED is significantly better with regard to sustainability, expressed in their cumulative energy demand, if ions with a molar weight between approximately 20 and 200 g mol(-1) have to be separated. Generally, an increase of the two cumulative energy demands occurred separating sodium gluconate. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) has become a popular treatment option for patients suffering from severe Parkinson's disease (PD). Yet the long-term outcome of subthalamic DBS is unknown.
   A total of 27 patients suffering from severe PD underwent bilateral stereotactic implantation of high-frequency stimulators in the STN. Before surgery and at least annually after surgery they were examined with the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS).
   This study presents the results of a mean 30 months (range 23 to 55) follow-up of these patients. We found stable and significant off medication improvement of motor function by DBS (between 40% and 44% in the UPDRS part III). While on medication there was no significant change in the motor function by DBS. UPDRS part III worsened gradually during the follow-up period, suggesting disease progression. Thirty months postsurgery the UPDRS part II (ADL) was still improved by 17%. There was a lasting decrease in fluctuations by more than 50%, and dyskinesias were reduced by about 70%. Freezing was reduced significantly from 2.2 in the UPDRS part II to 1.2 at the endpoint. The daily levodopa-equivalent dose was reduced by 39% at 12 months and by 30% at 30 months after STN stimulator implantation.
   Subthalamic DBS improves sustainable motor function in patients with severe Parkinson's disease and leads to a lasting reduction of medication. Limitations of this procedure were found for disturbances of speech and swallowing. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Hot compressed water in the sub- and supercritical state exhibits exciting physical and chemical properties, which can be varied continuously from gas-like to liquid-like behaviour. Correspondingly, the solvent properties can change from non-polar behaviour as present, for example, in organic solvents to highly ionic characteristics like in salt melts. This opens up several promising opportunities for separation processes and chemical reactions. Under supercritical conditions, substantial amounts of gases and organic substances can homogeneously be mixed with water, which then can be separated by adjusting the subcritical conditions by forming additional phases. This can beneficially be combined with chemical reactions occurring in the homogeneous state leading to integrated processes, which are more effective and competitive. Three approaches to the technical application of hot compressed water are presented to show and discuss the technology, potential, technical hurdles and future research demand in this area of research and development.
   In supercritical water oxidation (SCWO) water is used as a medium in which organic pollutants are completely degraded under the addition of oxygen, which is completely miscible with water under the process conditions of up to 650degreesC and pressures around 25 MPa. Thus, high space-time yields in compact reactor designs can be realized.
   Hydrogen is produced from biomass by hydrothermal gasification. Here, in an excess of water, the reaction at temperatures up to 700 degreesC and pressures around 30 MPa directly leads to valuable hydrogen instead of synthetic gas, as in conventional gasification processes, or methane at subcritical conditions in water. After reaction, pressurized hydrogen is obtained and can easily be enriched due to the different partition coefficients of hydrogen and carbon dioxide between the aqueous and gas phase.
   Even homogeneous catalysis is possible in supercritical water. This has been demonstrated with the cobalt-catalysed cyclotrimerization of acetylenes to form benzene derivatives or hydroformylation to produce aldehydes from olefins. There, only the addition of CO is necessary, the H-2 required being formed by the equilibrium of the water-gas-shift reaction. After a homogeneous reaction in the supercritical state, the reaction mixture can be separated at subcritical conditions.
   In support of the chemical and technical developments and to principally understand the experimental findings fundamental aspects have to be investigated as well. Intensive studies have been devoted to chemical kinetics including the modelling with elementary reaction steps, e.g. to separate ionic and radical reaction pathways. Depending on the reaction conditions, ionic or radical reaction pathways can be favoured or suppressed, allowing for control selectivity. Furthermore, corrosion of relevant reactor materials has been investigated.

AB Olefin metathesis opens up new industrial routes to important petrochemicals, oleochemicals, polymers and specialty chemicals. The most important applications of olefin metathesis in the field of petrochemicals are the olefins conversion technology (OCT) process (originally the Phillips triolefin process) and the Shell higher olefins process (SHOP).
   In particular, naphtha steam crackers with an integrated metathesis unit are an interesting alternative for producing propene via the OCT process, as a high global demand for propene outpaces supply from conventional sources. In the polymer field, ring-opening metathesis polymerisation (ROMP) of cycloalkenes is an attractive process for making polymers possessing special properties. Several industrial processes involving ROMP have been developed and brought into practice, such as the ROMP of cyclooctene, norbornene and dicyclopentadiene, leading to useful polymers. Metathesis of natural fats and oils and their derivatives offers possibilities for future developments in the oleochemical industry, providing a contribution to a sustainable chemical industry. Moreover, in the light of the new metal-carbene metathesis catalysts, in particular the functional-group-tolerant well-defined ruthenium-based catalysts, it is to be expected that in the fine chemistry the metathesis reaction will soon find its way as a tool for the synthesis of agrochemicals, insect pheromones, fragrances, pharmaceutical intermediates, etc. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

AB Foresters are under increasing national and global pressure to demonstrate that forestry activities are ecologically sustainable. One aspect of this is maintenance of current biodiversity on forest management areas. This is problematic where rare species are concerned, due to a paucity of information on which to base management decisions, and potential difficulties in monitoring such species. Generally, species with narrow geographic distribution and high habitat specificity are rare and are most at risk due to habitat change. We present a method of identifying rare species found in commercial habitat types that may be at risk due to forestry activities. We also introduce the concept of temporal rarity into a systematic classification system. We then apply this system to data on songbirds from the boreal mixedwood ecoregion in Alberta, Canada. We identified an initial list of 33 species that were rare based on a rank abundance plot. We then removed species from the list whose geographic ranges within the ecoregion were peripheral and that were more abundant in non-commercial habitat types. We added species that were abundant in our year of sampling but were rare in most other years and flagged species that were irruptive or hard to detect. Finally, we evaluated the conservation priority of the remaining 18 species using three criteria: (1) those that were specialists on habitats that will be reduced or altered by forestry, (2) those already listed as sensitive, and (3) those with restricted continental ranges that overlapped substantially with the focal ecoregion.

AB With the high rates of deforestation in tropical regions, the restoration of degraded lands has become an important way for maintaining the diversity of plant communities and for creating wildlife habitats. Evaluating the success of restored areas is essential for improving restoration designs and for successfully restoring such complex ecosystems. In this study, the development of restoration forests with respect to age (5, 9 and 10 years old) and the restoration models used (proportion of pioneer trees) was assessed along the margins of Companhia Energetica do Estado de Sao Paulo (CESP) reservoirs, located in the region of Pontal do Pananapanema, in Sao Paulo state, southeastern Brazil. The overstory (trees greater than or equal to4.8 cm in DBH) was assessed in nine 900 m(2) permanent plots, and all woody understory regenerating plants (>50 cm in height and <4.8 cm in DBH) were counted and identified in 54 1 m radius subplots. Canopy and grass cover were assessed in the wet and dry seasons. All of the parameters were recorded again I year later to evaluate the development of the forests. In general, neither the restoration design nor age appeared to influence forest structure and dynamics, at least at the developmental stage studied here. The floristic complexity and density of regenerating individuals were still fairly low compared to natural forests. The arrival of propagules from other forest remnants was insignificant, suggesting that inadequate seed dispersal and faunal colonization limited species enrichment within the restoration sites. Although the overall results suggested that these restoration forests had reached a structural complexity sufficient to give a start to secondary succession, some factors such as the dominance of pioneer trees in the overstory, the small number of colonizing individuals arriving from external seed sources, the persistence of weedy grasses in the understory and the degree of isolation of the restoration sites may endanger the sustainability of these forests in the long term. Although neither the age nor restoration model produced differences in the forest structure and dynamics, it is possible that such differences may require a longer time to develop. Monitoring restoration sites is essential for understanding a forest's trajectory and for guiding management and intervention practices. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The 21st century has brought new challenges for forest management at a time when global climate change is becoming increasingly apparent. Additional to various goods and services being provided to human beings, forest ecosystems are a large store of terrestrial carbon and account for a-major part of the carbon exchange between the atmosphere and the land surface. Depending on the management regime, forests can thus be either a sink, or a source of atmospheric carbon. Southeast Asia or ASEAN comprises 10 countries of different cultures and political background. Rapid economic development and fast-growing population in the region have raised much concern over the use of natural resources, especially forest resources. This study aims at finding the appropriate measures for sustainable use and management of tropical forests on a long-term basis. Between 1990 and 2000, about 2.3 million ha of forest were cleared every year and lost to other forms of land use. In terms of carbon emissions, a net amount of approximately 465 million t per year were released to the atmosphere over the same period, which amounts to 29% of the global net carbon release from deforestation worldwide.
   This study provides an approach to analyzing the implications of alternative forest and land management options on forest carbon stocks. This is done in three steps: First, observed trends in land use are expressed in terms of a model in order to create a scenario for the period 1980-2050. Second, forest management practices and timber production rates are analyzed and three management scenarios are created: (1) continuing the current rate of exploitation, (2) management for long-term economic gains, and (3) climate-beneficial management. Third, the impact of the three scenarios on regional carbon storage is estimated on the basis of a carbon balance model. Comparing the additional rate of carbon sequestration of scenario (3) over scenario (2), and taking into account differing management costs, we also discuss a framework for industrialized countries to invest in carbon credits in the region in order to fulfil their commitments under present and future climate protection agreements.

AB Soil profile disturbance and compaction can have a long-term detrimental impact on soil properties. Organic matter, macroporosity and bulk density was measured during 1989 and 1999 in three types of snig tracks: primary (PST), secondary (SST) and tertiary snig tracks (TST), log landings (LL), general logging areas (disturbed areas which were not occupied by snig tracks or log landings) and undisturbed areas (HA-SO). Within the general logging areas, measurements were made for three levels of soil profile disturbance: litter disturbed (HA-SI), topsoil disturbed (HA-S2) and subsoil disturbed (HA-S3). During 1989 samples were taken from 0 to 100 mm soil depth and during 1999 from 0 to 100, 100 to 200 and 200 to 300 mm soil depth.
   No significant differences in organic matter content, macroporosity and bulk density were found between 1989 and 1999 for most of the sampling sites. The rate of recovery of organic matter, macroporosity and bulk density varied depending with degree of soil disturbance and soil depth. The subsoil disturbance (HA-S3) had more influence on soil physical properties than any other type of disturbance. In general, the effect of soil profile disturbance and compaction on soil properties was greater at surface soil than deeper soil. Ten years after logging, macroporosity and organic matter content was significantly lower in the PST and HA-S3 compared to undisturbed areas. In the HA-S3 and PST, organic matter, macroporosity and bulk density was 31-41% lower, 44-60% lower, 22-68% greater, respectively, compared to undisturbed areas. The results are discussed in relation to tree growth and Montreal Process soil indicators. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Role of flies and provision of latrines in trachoma control:
   cluster-randomised controlled trial

AB Background Eye-seeking flies have received much attention as possible trachoma vectors, but this remains unproved. We aimed to assess the role of eye-seeking flies as vectors of trachoma and to test provision of simple pit latrines, without additional health education, as a sustainable method of fly control.
   Methods In a community-based, cluster-randomised controlled trial, we recruited seven sets of three village clusters and randomly assigned them to either an intervention group that received regular insecticide spraying or provision of pit latrines (without additional health education) to each household, or to a control group with no intervention. Our primary outcomes were fly-eye contact and prevalence of active trachoma. Frequency of child fly-eye contact was monitored fortnightly. Whole communities were screened for clinical signs of trachoma at baseline and after 6 months. Analysis was per protocol.
   Findings Of 7080 people recruited, 6087 (86%) were screened at follow-up. Baseline community prevalence of active trachoma was 6%. The number of Musca sorbens flies caught from children's eyes was reduced by 88% (95% CI 64-100; p < 0.0001) by insecticide spraying and by 30% (7-52; p = 0.04) by latrine provision by comparison with controls. Analysis of age-standardised trachoma prevalence rates at the cluster level (n = 14) showed that spraying was associated with a mean reduction in trachoma prevalence of 56% (19-93; p = 0.01) and 30% with latrines (-81 to 22; p = 0.210) by comparison with the mean rate change in the controls.
   Interpretation Fly control with insecticide is effective at reducing the number of flies caught from children's eyes and is associated with substantially lower trachoma prevalence compared with controls. Such a finding is consistent with flies being important vectors of trachoma. Since latrine provision without health education was associated with a significant reduction in fly-eye contact by M sorbens, studies of their effect when combined with other trachoma control measures are warranted.

AB Health trends over much of the past century have been generally, and notably, positive throughout the world. In several regions, however, life expectancy has declined over the past 1-2 decades. This trend suggests that the expectation that emerged in the 1960s and 1970s of worldwide gains and convergence in population health status is not guaranteed by a general deterministic process. National populations can now be clearly grouped into those that have achieved rapid gains in life expectancy; those whose gains are slower or are perhaps plateauing; and those in which the trends have reversed. Over the past two centuries, outside times of war and famine, such reversals have been rare. Exploration of these varied population health trends elucidates better the close relation between population health and the processes of economic, social, and technological change. Such analysis has shown that the health status of human populations should be a guiding criterion in the debate on sustainable development.

AB Effects of hypothermia on the afferent somatosensory transmission to the ventroposteromedial (VPM) thalamus were determined in anesthetized rats and hamsters. Hamsters showed a gradual suppression of afferent sensory transmission during cooling (to 18 degreesC) and disinhibition during subsequent warming of body temperature (Tb). However, rats exhibited steep inhibition from Tb 26 degreesC to complete absence of sensory transmission at Tb 20 degreesC and abrupt disinhibition during subsequent warming. Species difference at thalamic level was;quite similar to our previous results in the primary somatosensory (SI) cortex, suggesting that changes of sensory transmission observed in the SI cortex may have already occurred at thalamic level. Differences between the cortex and the thalamus were observed only during deep hypothermia in rat and during the final period of warming in hamster. Conduction latencies of thalamocortical system of both species were not influenced during Tb lowering until 24 degreesC (equivalent to brain temperature 25-26 degreesC). These results suggest inherently different adaptability to hypothermia in processing somatosensory information between hibernator and non-hibernator, but similar sustainability of sensory functions of the thalamocortical system during hypothermia in both species.

TI Food production and environment in Togo - An econometric analysis
SO AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT REVIEW-REVUE AFRICAINE DE DEVELOPPEMENT
LA French
DT Article
AB in Togo, agricultural production continues to fall at the same time as the state of the natural environment continues to suffer from physical degradation. The aim of this study is to evaluate the contribution of environmental considerations vis-a-vis other factors to growth in agricultural food production. The hypothesis to be tested is centred on the question of whether growth in food production is less associated with climatic conditions than with physical and human investments. The conclusion reached is that environmental factors are not a determinant in explaining the variation in food production. As a consequence, food policies in Togo should not emphasize investments in human and physical capital to the detriment of ecological factors. It is therefore essential that future food policies seek an optimal mix between such elements as physical investments, human capital development and environmental sustainability in ensuring food security in Togo.

AB There is an increasing call for tools that provide insight into the complex nature of agricultural systems and that deal with a broad range of sustainability issues related to policy intervention, technological innovations, and changes in environmental conditions (e.g., climate change). Sustainability indicators are useful, but only if their number is limited and the interactions between indicators are taken into consideration. In this context, we propose a methodology for an integrated analysis of tradeoffs between economic and environmental indicators. The analysis to quantify these relationships should be based on a multi-disciplinary approach and as such requires the usage of bio-physical as well as econometric-process simulation models. The communication between these very different models is based on explicit definitions of spatial and temporal scales and model integration software. The methodology is based on spatially explicit econometric simulation models linked to spatially referenced bio-physical simulation models to simulate land use and input use decisions. The methodology has been applied for the potato-pasture production system in the Ecuadorian Andes. Results of the analysis are presented in the form of tradeoff curves between different indicators, but also as maps, and risks diagrams. Besides an analysis of the current status, the approach allows for the analysis of alternative scenarios showing the effect of those scenarios on the position and slope of the tradeoff curve.

AB There is a need for an improved understanding of nitrogen (N) dynamics in depleted sandy soils in southern Africa. A field experiment was conducted to evaluate the performance of different soil fertility improvement practices on a degraded granitic sandy soil in Zimbabwe. Legumes capable of accumulating large amounts of N through biological N-2 fixation and subsoil N capture were tested against soybean/maize rotation, cattle manure fertilization and continuous maize (Zea mays L) with or without fertilizer. Soybean (Glycine max) accumulated 82 kg ha(-1) N (seed + stover), while mucuna (Mucuna pruriens) produced 87 kg ha(-1) N in its biomass. Soybean fixed 76% of its N, while mucuna fixed 96% of the accumulated N as estimated by the N-15 natural abundance method. Although the following maize crop in the second season suffered from drought stress, maize N uptake was 14.8 kg ha(-1) following soybean and 16.4 kg ha(-1) following mucuna, compared with 5.2 kg ha(-1) for the unfertilized maize and 25.6 kg ha(-1) for the maize fertilized with N at 90 kg ha(-1). Cajanus cajan and Crotalaria paulina added barely 10 kg ha(-1) of N through their biomass and had no effect on N uptake by maize. Apparent recovery of the added N by maize was 47% for the fertilized maize, 36% for soybean, 12% for mucuna and 9% for cattle manure. There was very little partitioning of N into grain and uptake was mostly before the onset of the drought. Despite the large differences in added residue N, differences in soil mineral N were only evident up to 4 weeks after the beginning of the rains, after which mineral N concentrations became very small in all treatments due to leaching, rather than crop uptake. By the eighth week after crop emergence, maize root length density had increased to about 0.1 cm cm(-3) at the 60-80 cm depth, the rapid increase apparently stimulated by the drought. It was concluded that mineral N available to maize from the residues tested falls short of what is required to sustain high maize yields. In these environments where biomass accumulation in many legumes is restricted by soil biophysical factors (poor nutrient concentrations, acidity, coarse texture), combinations of legume rotations and mineral N fertilization will remain the most viable option for sustainable agriculture.

AB This study presents a methodology for risk analysis and assessment of drought disaster to agricultural production in the maize-growing area of Songliao Plain of China based on Geographical Information Systems (GIS) from the viewpoints of climatology, geography, disaster science, and environmental science and so on. Crop yield-climate analysis and regression analysis were employed to analyze and quantify relationships between the fluctuation of maize yield and agro-meteorological disasters, and to evaluate the consequences of drought disaster based on historical climate, crop yield, crop sown area, crop damaged area and crop loss data from 41 maize-producing districts of Songliao Plain (1949-1990). The model of risk assessment of drought disaster combined the occurrence frequency, duration and intensity of drought, spatial extent of damage caused by drought and regional production level of maize were developed using a method of quantitative risk analysis. It is shown that drought was the greatest agro-meteorological disaster. Among all agro-meteorological disasters, drought occurs with the highest frequency, covers the largest area, and causes the greatest loss to agricultural production and economy in the region. From 1949 to 1990, the negative value years of the fluctuation of maize yield due to agro-meteorological disasters accounted for 55%, of which 60% was caused by drought. A significant positive relationship between the negative values of fluctuation of maize yield and drought affected area was found, which indicates that the adverse impacts of drought on maize production are similar to the damage extent of drought disaster. According to the risk extent of drought disaster to maize, the Songliao Plain was divided into four sub-regions: high risk zone, medium risk zone, low risk area and slight risk zone by using fuzzy cluster analysis. It showed the risk degree of drought disaster in the Songliao Plain increases gradually from south to north and from east to West. The information obtained from interviewing the district official committees in relation to result compiled was statistically evaluated. The results obtained in this study can provide the basis for developing strategies to mitigate drought and reducing the losses, and to ensure agricultural sustainable development.

AB Background: In programs to control iodine deficiency disorders (IDD), sustainability is a major concern. IDD has recently recurred in countries where salt iodization programs have lapsed.
   Objective: The objective of the study was to describe the evolution of thyroid dysfunction after the discontinuation of salt iodization in a cohort of children in an area of severe endemic goiter.
   Design: Moroccan children (aged 6-16 y, n = 159) with severe IDD received iodized salt (IS) for 1 y. Because of practical and financial constraints, including a lack of infrastructure and electricity at the production site, salt iodization abruptly ceased. The children were followed for another 14 trio, and concentrations of urinary iodine, thyrotropin, total thyroxine, and thyroglobulin and thyroid volume were measured.
   Results: Before iodization, median urinary iodine was 18 mug/L, 88% of children had elevated serum thyroglobulin concentrations, and 72% were goitrous. One year after the introduction of IS, median urinary iodine and thyroglobulin concentrations had normalized, mean thyroid volume had decreased by 34%, and median thyrotropin and mean total thyroxine concentrations were improved. Five months after the discontinuation of salt iodization, median urinary iodine had fallen to 20 mug/L. Fourteen months after the discontinuation of salt iodization, the rate of goiter was again similar to the rate before salt iodization; median thyrotropin and thyroglobulin concentrations were sharply higher than before the introduction of IS (P < 0.001); and the prevalence of hypothyroidism was 10%, compared with 3% before the introduction of IS (P < 0.001).
   Conclusions: In IDD-affected areas, cessation of salt iodization is associated with a rapid deterioration of thyroid function in school-age children. These findings underline the importance of sustainability in IDD control and the vulnerability of children to even short-term lapses in IS programs.

AB Endomorphin-1 is a short-chain neuropeptide with a high affinity for the mu-opioid receptor and has recently been localized in acutely inflamed knee joints where it was found to reduce inflammation. The present study examined the propensity of endomorphin- 1 to modulate synovial blood flow in normal and adjuvant-inflamed rat knee joints. Under deep urethane anesthesia, endomorphin- 1 was topically applied to exposed normal and 1 wk adjuvant monoarthritic knee joints (0.1 ml bolus; 10(-12)-10(-9) mol). Relative changes in articular blood flow were measured by laser Doppler perfusion imaging and vascular resistances in response to the opioid were calculated. In normal knees, endomorphin-1 caused a dose-dependent increase in synovial vascular resistance and this effect was significantly inhibited by the specific mu-opioid receptor antagonist D-Phe-Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Orn-Thr-Pen-Thr amide (CTOP) ( P < 0.0001, 2-factor ANOVA, n = 5 - 7). One week after adjuvant inflammation, the hypoaemic effect of endormophin-1 was completely abolished ( P < 0.0001, 2-factor ANOVA, n = 5 - 7). Immunohistochemical analysis of normal and adjuvant-inflamed joints showed a ninefold increase in endomorphin- 1 levels in the monoarthritic knee compared with normal control. Western blotting and immunohistochemistry revealed a moderate number of mu-opioid receptors in normal knees; however, mu-opioid receptors were almost undetectable in arthritic joints. These findings demonstrate that peripheral administration of endomorphin- 1 reduces knee joint blood flow and this effect is not sustainable during advanced inflammation. The loss of this hypoaemic response appears to be due to downregulation of mu-opioid receptors as a consequence of endomorphin- 1 accumulation within the arthritic joint.

   In 1997, SSCHC recognized that restoration of local air and water quality and other environmental conditions, coupled with restoring family-supporting jobs in the neighborhood, could have a substantial impact on the overall health of families. Recent events indicate that SSCHC's pursuit of smart growth strategies has begun to pay off.

ID TALLGRASS PRAIRIE; SEASON; VEGETATION; DIVERSITY; DYNAMICS
AB Over the last 200 y the tallgrass prairie of the Midwestern United States has experienced widespread conversion to agricultural production. Today, the few remaining tracts of unplowed grassland persist as small isolated patches within a landscape of row-crop agriculture. The small size and isolation of these prairie remnants raises concerns over their long-term sustainability. In this study I examined changes in the upland plant community that have occurred since state acquisition of one of Iowa's oldest prairie preserves. I found that 50 y of management has succeeded in reducing the frequency of exotic species and, thus, improved the overall integrity of the native plant community. However, during this same period dramatic changes in the frequency of many native species have also occurred. A general increase by mesic and late flowering species and a decrease by xeric natives was observed. Changes coincided with a documented shift in management from mid-summer haying prior to state ownership to spring burning, suggesting that burning may have exerted selective forces altering the composition of the native community over the past 50 y. My results emphasize the need to merge our current understanding of the processes that help sustain diversity into implemented management practices that will prolong the diversity of our remaining small isolated prairie preserves.

AB We simulated populations of threeridge mussels (Amblema plicata, Say, 1817) using empirically derived survival rates. Survival rates were derived from a mark-recapture study of mussels conducted in the Mississippi and Otter Tail rivers, Minnesota. The software package VORTEX was used to develop a base line population model which changed little or not at all through time. Models based on the initial base line data were constructed to simulate behaviors of A. plicata populations under various levels of mortality attributed to zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha, Pallas 1771) colonizations. Models were also developed that simulated varying levels of commercial harvesting of A. plicata. Sensitivity analysis revealed that A. plicata populations are most sensitive to alterations in adult survival. Adult survival is the life history stage most often impacted by both D. polymorpha colonizations and commercial harvesting. Population models simulating D. polymorpha mediated mortality revealed that population extinction was likely to occur within 50 y if survival rates remain at the levels recently measured. Models that simulated a commercial harvest of only 5% of the adult A. plicata population predicted that populations will decline by almost 50% in only 40 y. Our recommendation is that a concerted effort should be made to estimate the population size of potentially harvested populations of freshwater mussels. These estimates would allow for a more accurate estimate of what percentage of the adult mussels are actually being harvested. The population estimates would also allow for setting of quotas or limiting the number of permits for harvesters in the face of increased D. polymorpha infestations, thereby ensuring that harvested populations of mussels are not being over exploited. These modeling efforts will be useful for resource managers attempting to establish a sustainable harvest of commercially valuable mussel species which may be competing with a nonindigenous species.

AB Whalewatching has grown into a major tourist activity, yet there are many concerns about its negative impacts. This has stimulated the development of a large number of codes of conduct. This paper presents the results of a manifest content analysis of 58 such codes from around the world. The analysis revealed considerable variation among them, not least in terms of the detail of the various guidelines they contain. This variation is not considered to be propitious for the sustainable development of whalewatching, particularly given how little is currently known about the nature of human-cetacean interactions and the complex and highly fragmented regulatory context in which this activity tends to take place.

AB Biogas may be utilised for Combined Heat and Power (CHP) production or for transport fuel production (CH4-enriched biogas). When used to produce transport fuel either electricity is imported to power the plant or some of the biogas is used in a small CHP unit to meet electricity demand on site. The potential revenue from CH4-enriched biogas when replacing petrol is higher than that for replacing diesel (Irish prices). Transport fuel production when replacing petrol requires the least gate fee. The production of greenhouse-gas is generated with cognisance of greenhouse-gas production with the scheme not in place; landfill of the Organic Fraction of Municipal Solid Waste (OFMSW) (20% of biomass) with and without combustion of landfill gas is investigated. The transport scenario with importation of brown electricity generates more greenhouse-gas than petrol or diesel,,when the 'do-nothing' case involves combustion of landfill gas. The preferred solution involves transport fuel production with the production of CHP to meet electricity demand on site. A shortfall of this solution is that only 53% of biogas is available for export. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The paper attempts to determine the extent to which rainfall trends and land use changes influence the river flow regime and flood response of a predominantly agricultural catchment (210 km(2)) in southwest England. Temporal changes in daily rainfall totals were analysed over annual, seasonal and monthly timescales but although annual average October rainfalls exhibited a weak rising trend (r = 0.3, p > 0.05), no long-term patterns were observed. Analysis of daily mean discharge data for the River Camel over the period 1965-2000, using the Gumbel distribution, revealed an increase in the magnitude and frequency of peak flows. Land use changes were examined using Agricultural Census Data for 1969, 1979, 1988, 1997 and 2000. Both the number of stock and the area under cereals increased from 1969 to 1997, but cereal production declined substantially between 1997 and 2000. Spatial response patterns were also examined through a comparison of the flow response of the entire Camel catchment with its more complex land use, with the predominantly pastoral De Lank head-water sub-catchment (22 km(2)), to ascertain the amount of change due to increased livestock numbers alone. No single factor was found to be responsible for the increases in flood frequency and magnitude in the River Camel. Rather, long-term changes in the response of the Camel system appear to emanate from the cumulative impact of subtle changes in climate, combined with increased farming activity plus urban expansion. The paper highlights the inherent difficulties of attempting to disentangle the precise effects of individual land uses on flood responses at the catchment scale and underlines the need for a holistic approach to the management of floods. By the same token, sustainable catchment management can only be achieved through greater awareness of the potential for complex, small-scale land use decisions to result in large-scale hydrological changes.

AB Inshore marine areas host key habitats for the biological cycle of many marine populations, but are subject to strong anthropogenic pressure. Uses of inshore areas are multiple and often give rise to conflicting interests. In this context. marine protected areas (MPAs) and artificial reefs (ARs) are increasingly regarded as interesting management measures, in that they contribute to ecosystem conservation, fisheries sustainability, and because they can be helpful in zoning coastal areas in order to reduce conflicts between users. Beyond these expected benefits, it is important to appraise whether MPAs and ARs meet managers' objectives. This review focuses on the interaction between ecological sciences and management in the purpose of establishing or monitoring MPAs and ARs. We first study how objectives have to be formalized through management plans, and which kinds of information need to be collected in this respect. We then report management objectives related to MPAs and ARs, and list corresponding observed effects. Finally, we discuss the present role of monitoring and scientific research in the management process and propose a few perspectives for scientific research.

AB Marine Protected Areas (MPA) are often contemplated as a tool for the sustainable management of exploited resources and ecosystem conservation. This paper proposes an approach to establish a statistical diagnostic of the effects of MPAs on fish assemblages, and define corresponding ecological indicators. This requires choosing relevant variables (abundance, diversity, demographic parameters..) and appropriate statistical methods. The study was based on data from the Abore reef Reserve in New Caledonia. Two sets of methods: 1-inferential linear models (ANOVA, GLM): 2- Partial Least Squares (PLS) methods of regression, were used to test the effects of this MPA. PLS enabled us to test simultaneously within a model, density, species richness, biomass and mean size variables of fish community to retain the most sensitive and relevant ones. Habitat variability was also taken into account in these models. Species were grouped according to several criteria: 1-feeding habit; 2- taxonomy; 3-mobility; 4-adult size; 5-demographic strategy. No significant effect of the opening of the Abore reef to fishing was found for mobility. Feeding habit was the only criterion for which the results from the inferential models and PLS showed a significant effect of reserve status for all variables. Species richness, density, and to a lesser extent mean size, were sensitive to the removal of reserve status. but not biomass. Results from ANOVA and PLS regression were consistent but the latter allows a more holistic approach as it integrates all variables within a single model.

AB The most important factors in sustainable energy development are the prospects for global economic growth and investment, improved energy accessibility for the poor, security of supply and the local, regional or global emissions resulting from energy production and use. These issues are interlinked, and actions to address them will drive the energy sector for many years to come.
   Taking into account economic trends and feedbacks over the last 30 years WEC has concluded that global GDP could grow at significantly less than 3 % per annum for the next three decades.
   Without clear policies and targeted, temporary programmes to offset higher final energy prices, WEC doubts whether it will be possible to deliver sustainable commercial energy access for the world's poor within the period to 2030. We would miss a significant opportunity to establish a cycle of economic growth and social stability to the benefit of all people in both rich and poor countries.
   WEC argues that oil will continue to be the dominant marginal fuel in energy markets for many decades to come and that synthetic fuels, such as liquids from coal, will increasingly play a role as a prelude to the hydrogen economy. Without the stimulus of higher real energy prices, efficiency improvements in energy production, transportation, distribution or end use cannot be sustained.
   It is WECs view that the number one action simultaneously to meet energy security and emissions goals is to keep all energy options open, including GHG-neutral energy sources such as nuclear and large hydro power.

   Yunnan's biodiversity
AB Yunnan, an inland province at a low latitude and high elevation, lying between 21degrees09'-29degrees15' N and 97degrees32'-106degrees12' E in southwestern China, has a vast territory with diversified and unique nature resources. There are more than 18 000 high plant species (51.6% of China's total) and 1836 vertebrate species (54.8% of China's total) living in Yunnan on a land area of 39.4 x 10(4) km(2), i.e., only 4.1% of China's total. Among 15000 seed plants found in Yunnan there are 151 rare and endangered plant species (42.6% of China's protected plants). Out of 335 China priority protected wild animals, Yunnan has 243 species, accounting for 72.5% of China's total, 15% of which are species endemic to Yunnan. However, Yunnan's biodiversity is faced with the menace of excessive exploitation of resources and changes in environmental conditions caused by the activities of an expanding human population. This paper discusses the background, the composition, and the structure of Yunnan's biodiversity. Its biodiversity fragility and the threatened situation are also discussed. Suggestions and recommendations on the strategy and actions of Yunnan biodiversity conservation and sustainable development are proposed.

AB Over 100 native herbaceous forest perennials are harvested in the United States. Management of these populations for continued survival requires information on the long-term effects of varied harvesting levels on populations of forest perennials. Allium tricoccum Ait. is a species that is harvested throughout its range for its edible bulb. We examined the recovery of A. tricoccum populations over a 5-year period following experimental harvests of different intensity to predict the number of years required to return to pre-harvest levels and to establish guidelines for sustainable harvesting. Our harvest treatments included removal of 0, 25, 50, 75, and 100% of plants within experimental plots. Treatments were repeated at three sites. Population recovery was monitored for 4 years at two sites and 7 years at one site. We found a relationship between the level of harvest and the negative impacts on populations of A. tricoccum, with limited population recovery in the 4 years following harvesting. We projected recovery times as a function of harvest level using a population projection model. Deterministic projections of recovery time ranged from 148 years for a 95% harvest to 2.5 years for a 5% harvest. Incorporating stochasticity into our projections increased the uncertainty in our estimates of recovery time. For example the recovery time from a 5% harvest ranged from 1 to 89 years (95% confidence limit). Based on our results, a 10% harvest once every 10 years would, on average, be a sustainable level of harvest for A. tricoccum in southern Appalachian forests. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Over the last few decades a dramatic decline in the number of Mediterranean monk seals (Monachus monachus) limited scientific studies on the biology.. behaviour, and ecology of the species. This lack of information impaired the effectiveness of conservation strategies. Thus, any further information gathered on the monk seal has utmost value in the work to halt and reverse the plight of the species. A hitherto unknown Cilician Basin colony of the Mediterranean monk seal has been investigated during a 6-year period between 1995 and 2001. Results of direct in-cave surveys and land based seal-watch observations enabled the evaluation of habitat use and preliminary demographic information. A total of 39 caves were discovered among which only three were used for breeding. Scarcity of the breeding caves emphasised the importance of breeding habitat in the survival of the colony. Common features of the breeding caves are found as an entrance with a protective barrier against strong waves; a chamber with a wide beach; and a well-sheltered shallow pool. Supplementary data obtained from infrared monitors installed in three actively used caves were used to assess the number of individuals. Throughout the study period, 25 individuals were identified and 11 newborn pups were found. Evaluation of the results Suggests the presence of sub-regions inhabited by an individually identified sub-group of monk seals. Recommendations for conservation guided by this information is a Marine Protected Area consisting of two zones; a restricted core zone prohibiting any human activity securing breeding habitat and a restricted fishery zone securing sustainability of the food source.

AB Growth and soil N supply in young Eucalyptus tereticornis stands at two sites in Kerala, India, were examined in response to cover cropping with three legume species (Pueraria phaseoloides, Stylosanthes hamata, and Mucuna bracteata). The effects of legume residues on soil N supply were investigated in a. long-term (392 day) laboratory incubation using leaching microlysimeters. Residues from the eucalypt and legume species had different rates of net N release during the laboratory incubation. Net N release was significantly related to residue N concentration (R-2 =0.94), the C:N ratio (R-2 =0.91), the lignin:N ratio (R-2 =0.83), and the (lignin + soluble polyphenol):N ratio (R-2 =0.95). Nitrogen release rates declined in the order Mucuna > Pueraria > Eucalyptus > Stylosanthes. There was no net N release from Stylosanthes residues during the 392-day laboratory incubation, whereas Mucuna and Pueraria released N throughout the incubation period. Net N release from mixtures of legume and eucalypt residues was not additive in the early phase of the incubation, probably because eucalypt residues initially immobilized a portion of the legume-derived N in addition to the soil-derived N. Legume establishment had no significant effect on tree growth at one site (Kayampoovam), but resulted in depressed tree growth at the lower rainfall site (Punnala) at 18 months. There were no significant treatment effects on growth at Punnala after that time. Cover cropping with legumes during the early phase of forest plantation growth may be a useful mechanism to enhance soil N supply and optimize the synchrony between N supply and tree N uptake. Although these effects did not translate into improved plantation growth in the 3 years of this study, improved soil organic matter and N fertility may help ensure sustainable productivity over several rotations in the future. This study showed that the effect of legumes on N dynamics varies markedly with legume species. This, together with other factors (e.g. competition with trees, N fixation capacity), will be important in selecting suitable species for cover cropping in forest plantations.

AB 1. Flock balances of nitrogen, phosphorus, zinc and copper (N, P, Zn, Cu) were calculated in order to evaluate environmental effects of three different broiler production systems (intensive indoor, free range and organic).
   2. Nutrient gain in birds per unit nutrient intake (retention) in intensive indoor production was higher than in free range and organic production.
   3. Nutrient surplus relative to nutrient retention was higher in organic production than in free range and intensive indoor production.
   4. The main reasons for differences in nutrient efficiency between intensive indoor, free range and organic production were duration of growth period, strain of broilers and feeding strategy.
   5. The calculation of whole farm indicators (livestock density, N and P excretions per hectare of farmland) demonstrates how defining system boundaries affects the outcome of an evaluation: organic farms had the smallest livestock densities and the lowest N and P excretions per hectare of farmland.
   6. In the efforts to reach a more holistic evaluation of agricultural production systems, the definition of adequate system boundaries must be discussed. In addition to nutrient balances, further indicators of sustainability, such as human and ecological toxicity, should be considered.

AB Globally designers are concentrating on minimising the impact their buildings make on the environment. Although many claim their buildings to be sustainable, unless an objective analysis is carried out, it is not possible to determine the impact that a particular building has on the environment. This paper describes a method that has been developed at the University of Auckland for a detailed life cycle analysis of an individual house in New Zealand based on the embodied and operating energy requirements and life cycle cost over the useful life of the building.

AB Greenhouse and field experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of herbicides on soil microbial C (microbial biomass), bacterial diversity and community structure. In the first greenhouse experiment, 12 herbicides were applied at recommended rates to a Gray Luvisolic soil contained in trays. Soil samples were collected 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 wk after treatment and analysed for microbial C and bacterial diversity. The second greenhouse experiment was similar to the first, but only 6 of the 12 herbicides were applied to a Gray Luvisolic and Black Chernozemic soil. The same six herbicides were applied to the Gray Luvisolic soil at a field site near Fort Vermilion, Alberta, and to the Black Chernozemic soil at Lacombe, Alberta, in 2000. In the first greenhouse experiment, metribuzin, imazamox/imazethapyr, triasulfuron and metsulfuron methyl reduced microbial C compared with glufosinate ammonium and sethoxydim. In the second greenhouse experiment, microbial diversity as determined by Shannon index was lower after application of metribuzin, imazamox/imazethapyr and glufosinate ammonium than after application of glyphosate, but none of the herbicides altered microbial diversity relative to the control treatment. In the field experiments, herbicides had no effect on microbial C or diversity. In all experiments, examination of microbial community structure revealed herbicide-induced shifts in microbial composition even when diversity indices among treatments were not different. It was concluded that herbicides applied once at recommended rates did not have significant or consistent effects on microbial C or diversity.

AB In today's economy, chemical engineering must respond to the changing needs of the chemical process industry in order to meet market demands. The evolution of chemical engineering is necessary to remain competitive in global trade. The ability of chemical engineering to cope with managing complex systems met in scientific and technological problems is addressed in this paper. Chemical engineering is vital for sustainability: to satisfy both the market requirements for specific end-use properties of products and the social and environmental constraints of industrial-scale processes. An integrated system approach of complex multidisciplinary, non-linear, non-equilibrium processes and phenomena occurring on different length and time scales is required. This will be obtained due to breakthroughs in molecular modelling, scientific instrumentation and related signal processing and powerful computational tools. The future of chemical engineering can be summarized by four main objectives: (1) Increase productivity and selectivity through intensification of intelligent operations and a multiscale approach to process control; (2) Design novel equipment based on scientific principles and new production methods: process intensification; (3) Extend chemical engineering methodology to product design and engineering using the "triplet 3PE molecular Processes-Product-Process Engineering" approach; (4) Implement multiscale application of computational chemical engineering modelling and simulation to real-life situations from the molecular scale to the production scale.

AB Complexity issues in the ecological aspects of chemical engineering are of two kinds: the mutual interactions of many multi-scale systems and the lack of consilience in the objectives of different disciplines that consider the economic, philosophical, cultural, and scientific and engineering aspects, respectively. This paper discusses the second kind of complexity and the ecological issues in the different disciplines. Economic value, as expressed by market price, depends on whether limits on resources and the Earth's services due to the scale of human technological activities are taken into account. Human activities relative to the Earth's ecology require sustainability consideration. Two important stands on sustainability are discussed. Mainstream sustainability is a stand for continued economic growth to foster advances in technology to overcome the limits of the Earth. It requires technological activities to follow green chemistry and green engineering principles to develop innovations that are ecologically considerate. Environmental sustainability is a stand to stay within forecasted limits in the resources and renewability capacity of the Earth. The technology for this further includes using the principles of industrial ecology to locate ways to use wastes and recycle products as source materials for other processes to make and close material cycles. Chemical engineering innovations for increased atomic utilization of reactants, efficiency in energy use, dematerialization, non-toxicity, recyclability, and creative systemic cycling of materials for waste management are good for the ecology. Case studies are given showing the utility of following the principles developed for good ecological practice. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID 2,4,6-TRINITROTOLUENE TNT; SOLUBILITY; RDX
AB To achieve sustainable range management and avoid or minimize environmental contamination, the Army needs to know the amount of explosives deposited on ranges from different munitions and how these are degraded and transported under different geological and climatic conditions. The physical form of the deposited explosives has a bearing on this problem, yet the shapes and size distributions of the explosive particles remaining after detonations are not known.
   We collected residues from 8 high-order and 6 low-order non-tactical detonations of TNT-filled 155-mm rounds. We found significant variation in the amount of TNT scattered from the high-order detonations, ranging from 0.00001 to 2% of the TNT in the original shell. All low-order detonations scattered percent-level amounts of TNT. We imaged thousands of TNT particles and determined the size, mass and surface-area distributions of particles collected from one high-order and one low-order detonation. For the high-order detonation, particles smaller than I mm contribute most of the mass and surface area of the TNT scattered. For the low-order detonation, most of the scattered TNT mass was in the form of un-heated, centimeter-sized pieces whereas most of the surface area was again from particles smaller than I mm. We also observed that the large pieces of TNT disintegrate readily, giving rise to many smaller particles that can quickly dissolve. We suggest picking up the large pieces of TNT before they disintegrate to become point sources of contamination. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Effective utilization of water and energy is the key factor of sustainable development in process industries, and also an important science and technology problem to be solved in systems engineering. In this paper, two new methods of optimal design of water utilization network with energy integration in process industries are presented, that is, stepwise and simultaneous optimization methods. They are suitable for both single contaminant and multi-contaminant systems, and the integration of energy can be carried out in the whole process system, not only limited in water network, so that energy can be utilized effectively. The two methods are illustrated by case study.

ID OIL
AB Although Aberdeen can trace its origins, many of its buildings and street patterns back over hundreds of years, it is the last three decades that have radically affected and shaped the modern city. The discovery of North Sea oil and the decision by the major oil companies to centre their exploration and development activities in Aberdeen has provided a unique opportunity, though one that has brought associated and significant problems of growth management. Oil-related prosperity has been accompanied by growing economic disparities, pressure for new housing and commercial development and demands for investment in transport infrastructure. The management of development versus conservation tensions as well as the need to ensure oil-related growth benefits the whole community, have led to unique and groundbreaking public-private partnerships in the city. As the significance of oil in the local economy wanes attention is now increasingly being focused on how to ensure the longer term prosperity of the city. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

SO CLIMATIC CHANGE
LA English
DT Article
ID CONSTRUCTIVE APPROACH; MANAGEMENT
AB Land-use activities that affect the global balance of greenhouse gases have been a topic of intense discussion during ongoing climate change treaty negotiations. Policy mechanisms that reward countries for implementing climatically beneficial land-use practices have been included in the Bonn and Marrakech agreements on implementation of the Kyoto Protocol. However some still fear that land-use projects focused narrowly on carbon gain will result in socioeconomic and environmental harm, and thus conflict with the explicit sustainable development objectives of the agreement. We propose a policy tool, in the form of a multi-attribute decision matrix, which can be used to evaluate potential and completed land-use projects for their climate, environmental and socioeconomic impacts simultaneously. Project evaluation using this tool makes tradeoffs explicit and allows identification of projects with multiple co-benefits for promotion ahead of others. Combined with appropriate public participation, accounting, and verification policies, a land-use activity decision matrix can help ensure that progressive land management practices are an effective part of the solution to global climate change.

AB The vulnerability of grassland vegetation in Inner Mongolia to climate change and grazing was examined using an ecosystem model. Grazing is an important form of land use in this region, yet there are uncertainties as to how it will be affected by climate change. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to study the effects of increased minimum and maximum temperatures, ambient and elevated CO2, increased or decreased precipitation, and grazing on vegetation production. Simulations showed that herbaceous above ground net primary production was most sensitive to changes in precipitation levels. Combinations of increased precipitation, temperature, and CO2 had synergistic effects on herbaceous production, however drastic increases in these climate scenarios left the system vulnerable to shifts from herbaceous to shrub-dominated vegetation when grazed. Reduced precipitation had a negative effect on vegetation growth rates, thus herbaceous growth was not sustainable with moderate grazing. Shifts in temporal biomass patterns due to changed climate have potentially significant implications for grazing management, which will need to be altered under changing climate to maintain system stability.

AB Rattan, Old World climbing palm, is an extremely valuable nontimber forest product whose canes are gathered for both market and nonmarket uses. I evaluated the effects, of harvesting commercial rattan, Calamus zollingeri Becc., on genet survival and ramet demography in two primary forest sites near Lore Lindu National Park in Sulawesi, Indonesia. I monitored 168 permanently marked C. zollingeri genets for 4 years and surveyed random transects for C. zollingeri genet and ramet populations and evidence of cane harvesting in 1996 and 2000. Cane harvesting had no significant effect on genet survival or mean ramet densities. However, current cane extraction rates significantly reduced mean cane lengths and total available cane throughout the study period. Based on observed genet and ramet populations and average cane growth rates area during the stud of 1.4 m/year, the sustained-yield harvesting potential of C. zollingeri is approximately 101 m and 56 m/ha/year in the two study sites. Although C. zollingeri exhibits life-history traits well suited to sustained-yield harvesting, including production of multiple canes, cane resprouting following harvest, rapid cane growth, and widespread abundance below 1100 m, current harvest rates exceed growth and yield, and supplies of cane are being depleted. Rattan harvesting is widespread in Lore Lindu National Park. Approximately 18% of the park (42,000 ha) is likely subject to intensive and unsustainable extraction of C. zollingeri.

ID SELECTION; DIVERSITY
AB After generally discussing models in ecology and economics that combine competition, optimization, and evolution, this article concentrates on models of intraspecific competition. It demonstrates the importance of diversity/inequalities within populations of species and other environments for the sustainability of their populations, given the occurrence of environmental change. This is demonstrated both for scramble (open-access) and contest competition. Implications are drawn for human populations and industrial organization. The possibility is raised that within-industry competition may not always exist between firms in all stages of the development of a new industry. Policy implications are considered. For example, it is argued that policies designed to encourage intense business competition and maximum economic efficiency have the drawback of eventually making industries highly vulnerable to exogenous economic changes.

AB This paper argues that the Enron affair has been misunderstood as a failure of monitoring, with adverse consequences for the drafting of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Higgs report. Where Enron's board failed was in misunderstanding the risks which were inherent in the company's business plan and failing to implement an effective system of internal control. Enron demonstrates the limits of the monitoring board and points the way to a stewardship model in which the board takes responsibility for ensuring the sustainability of the company's assets over time.

AB We discuss the nature and role of (corporate) governance and (shareholder) value and their implications for (sustainable) economic performance. We critique and build on extant theory to develop a model of the determinants of value-wealth creation at the firm, national and global levels and explore current economic debates on governance and sustainable economic performance in its context. We conclude that (the need for) stakeholder value is derivative from (not opposed to) the concept of sustainable value, that national governance and the nationwide "governance-mix" impact on corporate governance and that national and global economic governance are essential for sustainable global value-wealth creation, and economic performance.

TI Place and the art of belonging
SO CULTURAL GEOGRAPHIES

DT Article
ID CULTURAL ACCOUNT; ISLE; SUSTAINABILITY; COMMUNITY; HARRIS
AB This paper explores the connections among place, identity and visual art with reference to the Harris Tapestry, created to mark the beginning of a new Millennium on the Isle of Harris, Outer Hebrides, Scotland. I focus on the material practices through which the Tapestry was created and the historical and cultural metaphors evoked through its embroidered motifs with a view to considering what it means to belong on the island. As a site where people's stories of the past and present are translated into the visual field, the Tapestry is a deeply politicized aesthetics, making visible social relations through which both island and aesthetic spaces are constituted. Centrally, these concern rights to land, the Tapestry exposing tensions through which metaphors of belonging have been challenged and resisted through time. In this sense, the Tapestry is iconic of a 'culture of resistance' ( Said, 1994) whose geography is island-centred rather than globally peripheral.

TI War, livelihoods and vulnerability in Sri Lanka
SO DEVELOPMENT AND CHANGE
LA English
DT Article
AB As the number of de-stabilized regions of warfare or post-war conditions worldwide continues to grow, this article investigates how civilians survive in the context of a civil war. It analyses livelihood strategies of farmers in the war-torn areas of Sri Lanka, using an analytical framework based on a revised form of DFID's sustainable rural livelihoods approach, placing particular attention on the institutional reproduction of household capital assets in the war economy. The author delineates a three pillar model of household livelihood strategies focusing on how households (1) cope with the increased level of risk and uncertainty; (2) adjust their economic and social household assets for economic survival; and (3) use their social and political assets as livelihood strategies. Empirical evidence comes from four case study villages in the east of Sri Lanka. Although the four case Studies were very close together geographically, their livelihood outcomes differed considerably depending on the very specific local political geography. The role of social and political assets is essential: while social assets (extended family networks) were important to absorb migrants, political assets (alliances with power holders) were instrumental in enabling individuals, households or economic actors to stabilize or even expand their livelihood options and opportunities. The author concludes that civilians in conflict situations are not all victims (some may also be culprits in the political economy of warfare), and that war can be both a threat and an opportunity, often Lit the same time.

TI Participatory watershed development in India: Can it sustain rural
   livelihoods?
SO DEVELOPMENT AND CHANGE
LA English
DT Article
AB The purpose of this article is to assess the impact of policy interventions through watershed development (WD) on the livelihoods of the rural communities. This is done by assessing the programme in the context of a sustainable rural livelihoods framework, that is, looking at its impact on the five types of capital assets and strategies required for the means of living. The article also examines the vulnerability and stability of these capital assets, as well as analysing which people participate in the programme and enhance their livelihoods through sharing its benefits. In the light of the analysis, it is argued that watershed development holds the potential for enhanced livelihood security even in geo-climatic conditions where the watershed cannot bring direct irrigation benefits oil a large scale. In such fragile environments, however, watershed development is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for sustaining rural livelihoods. While the focus of watershed development is primarily on strengthening the ecological base such as water bodies (including traditional tanks), grazing lands and wastelands, it should be complemented with other programmes which focus on landless poor households in order to make it pro-poor. In the context of low rainfall regions where improvement in irrigation facilities is slow, agriculture alone cannot support the communities. Policies and programmes should aim at creating an environment for diverse livelihood activities, which are the choice of the household rather than distress activities.

AB Vallisneria americana is a native macrophyte in freshwater and oligohaline ecosystems, often forming meadows that significantly affect ecosystem carbon and nutrient cycling and provide structural habitat. Vallisneria has declined in abundance in several Florida lakes, rivers, and estuaries. We conducted an 11-month field experiment in Kings Bay, Florida, USA, to determine factors that might affect successful transplantation of Vallisneria and to guide potential future restoration efforts by water resource management agencies. To determine the effects of herbivores and other primary producers on Vallisneria production, we conducted a 2 X 2 factorial experiment at three sites in which we allowed or denied: I) relatively large herbivores (>3 cm) and (2) other primary producers (e.g., Myriophyllum spicatum, Hydrilla verticillata, Lyngbya sp.) access to 1.5 X 1.5-m transplanted plots of Vallisneria. Within one month, Vallisneria disappeared from 80% of herbivore-access plots due primarily to consumption by manatees. Vallisneria density was reduced a variable amount (0-50%) in response to competitors, due to site-specific variation in natural abundance of other primary producers (at two sites, we observed extensive colonization by other primary producers and a strong treatment effect). Most of this competitive effect was attributable to Eurasian watermilfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum); after pooling Vallisneria density data across sites, we observed a negative exponential relationship between shoot density of Vallisneria and stem density of Myriophyllum for every sampling date. We observed variable recruitment of Vallisneria transplants into larger size classes among sites, but not between treatments, and large, established plants grew at Similar rates whether in monospecific or mixed stands, with evidence for reduced mass-specific growth in dense stands. Hence, a probable mechanism by which Myriophyllum reduces Vallisneria occurs via space limitation, and reduction in Vallisneria densities and/or recruitment and growth of new shoots. We conclude that two different management goals (restoration of Vallisneria and protection of manatees) are in conflict and must be simultaneously considered to devise effective and sustainable ecosystem management scenarios. Due to the highly managed nature of freshwater systems worldwide, the limitations of extrapolating experimental results and the importance of site-specific pilot experiments should also be recognized.

AB Small pelagic fish constitute 25-40% of the,fisheries landings in Mexico. More than 70% of these landings, predominantly Pacific sardine (Sardinops caeruleus), are captured in the Gulf of California. Small pelagic fishes are a key component of the Gulf's ecosystem; they are eaten by seabirds, sea mammals, and other fishes. The sardine fishery within the Gulf has been showing signs of overfishing since the early 1990s. To contribute to the sustainable management of this fishery, we developed two statistical models that use oceanographic conditions and seabird breeding and feeding data to predict total fishery catch and catch per unit effort (CPUE) of Pacific sardine in the central Gulf. Total catch was predicted with an accuracy of 54% by a linear model incorporating the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), the clutch size of Heermann's Gulls (Larus heermanni), and the proportion of sardine mass in the diet of Elegant Terns (Sterna elegans). CPUE was predicted with an accuracy of 73% by a model based on the proportion of sardines in. the diet of Elegant Terns, the reproductive success of Heermann's Gulls, and the springtime sea surface temperature anomaly in the Gulf region. Our results show that the reproductive ecology of seabirds is coupled to the global and local oceanographic conditions and that this information can be used to predict in advance the outcome of fishing efforts. We propose the use of models of this kind to reduce the effort of the fleet in years when it can be anticipated that CPUE will be low.

AB We contribute to the debate on whether the U.S. large federal budget deficits are sustainable in the long run. We model the U.S. government deficit per capita as a threshold autoregressive process. We find evidence that the U.S. budget deficit is sustainable in the long run and that economic policy makers will only intervene to reduce per capita deficit when it reaches a certain threshold.

TI Lessons for an ageing society: the political sustainability of social
   security systems
SO ECONOMIC POLICY

DT Article; Proceedings Paper
CT Economic Policy Conference
CY OCT, 2003

HO Bank Italy
AB What is the future of social security systems in OECD countries? We suggest that the answer belongs to the realm of politics, and evaluate how political constraints and ageing shape the social security system. The increasing ratio of retirees to workers lowers the rate of returns of unfunded pay-as-you-go social security, and induces citizens to prefer smaller such systems and a larger role for private savings. An ageing electorate, however, increases the relevance of pension spending on the agenda of office-seeking policy-makers and tends to increase the size of unfunded pension systems. Calibrating the strength of these effects for France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the UK and the US, we find that the latter political aspect always outweighs the former. The relative size of the effects depends on country-specific characteristics and modelling details: when labour market distortions are accounted for the political effect still dominates but becomes less sizeable; the different redistributive character of pension systems and the strength of family ties also play a role in determining politico-economic outcomes. A higher effective retirement age always decreases the size of the system chosen by the voters, often increases its generosity, and may be the only viable solution to pension system problems in the face of population ageing.

TI Basic income versus wage subsidies: Competing instruments in an optimal
   tax model with a maximin objective
SO ECONOMICS AND PHILOSOPHY
LA English
DT Article
ID EQUALITY
AB This article challenges the general thesis that an unconditional basic income, set at the highest sustainable level, is required for maximizing the income-leisure opportunities of the least advantaged, when income varies according to the responsible factor of labor input. In a linear optimal taxation model (of a type suggested by Vandenbroucke 2001) in which opportunities depend only on individual productivity, adding the instrument of a uniform wage subsidy generates an array of undominated policies besides the basic income maximizing policy, including a "zero basic income" policy which equalizes the post-tax wage rate. The choice among such undominated policies may be guided by distinct normative criteria which supplement the maximin objective in various ways. It is shown that most of these criteria will be compatible with, or actually select, the zero basic income policy and reject the basic income maximizing one. In view of the model's limited realism, the force of this main conclusion is discussed both in relation to Van Parijs' argument for basic income in Real Freedom for All (1995) and to some key empirical conditions in the real world.

AB This paper deals with a global approach in the thermal and airflow design of new dwellings and specially low-cost housing built in the French tropical overseas islands. The sizing of passive cooling techniques has been evaluated thanks to a simulation code. The solutions have been edited in a reference document that serves as work-base for the design of dwellings developments in the French tropical territories. An experimental and sociological survey has been carried out over two years (from 1998 to 1999) in order to validate the impact of these passive cooling specifications on the comfort of tenants and to have an immediate feedback and correct the solutions if necessary. The paper presents the implementation, the experimental survey and the results for the two first housing projects built according to the passive design specifications. This step is important because the aim of the public utilities is to expand the ECODOM specifications on a much broader scale and to prepare to future housing thermal regulations. The results indicated that the solar protection of the roof remains one of the main points in the thermal design of buildings in a tropical climate as well as the natural ventilation. The sociological study showed that the tenants were globally satisfied with their flat as far as the thermal aspects are concerned. However, dissatisfaction resulted from the bad acoustic design of the flats. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In the context of an increasing number of retrofitting projects and greater consideration for the criteria of sustainability, architects and engineers are looking for a global optimization of existing buildings and therefore need to multiply comparisons between different possible variants. In order to structure the approach of this complex process, research carried out with the support of the Swiss Academy of Engineering Sciences (SATW) and the Swiss National Energy Research Foundation (NEFF) in the framework of the European Master in Architecture and Sustainability has made it possible to develop a multicriteria assessment methodology for office building retrofitting strategies applied to different case studies. The present article presents a synthesis of this research and an explanation of the method as a contribution to a global vision of the retrofitting process. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

ID SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB In this study, energy utilization and its major environmental impacts are discussed from the standpoint of sustainable development, including anticipated patterns of future energy use and subsequent environmental issues in Turkey. Several aspects relating to energy utilization, renewable energy, energy efficiency, environment and sustainable development are examined from both current and future perspectives. Turkey is an energy importing country, more than half of the energy requirement has been supplied by imports. Domestic oil and lignite reserves are limited, and the lignites are characterised by high ash, sulfur and moisture content. Because of increasing energy consumption, environmental pollution is becoming a serious problem in the future for the country. In this regard, renewable energy resources appear to be one of the most efficient and effective solutions for sustainable energy development and environmental pollution prevention in Turkey. Turkey's geographical location has several advantages for extensive use of most of these renewable energy sources. Especially hydropower, biomass, geothermal, solar and wind energy should be considered and seriously supported by governments and private sectors. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Global tropical deforestation continues to be a critical environmental issue and nowhere in the world is the issue more pronounced than in Brazil. This paper examines the land-use choices of small-scale farmers in Ouro Preto do Oeste, Rondonia, Brazil and investigates how agricultural production impacts deforestation levels. The data used to explore these issues consist of a panel collected from 152 households in 1996 and 2000. Overall, the empirical models indicate that access to credit, wealth, lot size, product markets, and off-farm labor opportunities, largely influence deforestation and production decisions. Among other things, the results suggest that more sustainable production methods are unlikely to be adopted by a majority of households under current conditions because the production of milk has rapidly advanced due to its moderate labor requirements and existing market infrastructure. Households with greater levels of wealth have focused on milk while those with access to credit have focused on crops. Since the production of crops is largely influenced by access to credit, similar incentives may be proposed to support more sustainable production activities to help reduce deforestation.

AB This paper examines coping strategies in response to covariate flood shocks and idiosyncratic health shocks among riverine peasant households in the Amazonian tropical forests. An assessment of coping strategies reveals that although precautionary savings (food stock and livestock) are important for both types of shocks, ex post labor supply responses in the form of upland cropping and resource extraction (fishing and non-timber forest product gathering) are more common to cope with the flood shock depending on local environments. A bivariate probit model examines what factors shape households' adopt ion decisions of gathering and fishing as a coping strategy. The analysis reveals an important insurance role of non-timber forest product gathering for the asset poor who have limited options for coping with flood risk. Targeted interventions and programs for the poor to promote sustainable forest resource use are discussed.

TI The changing regulatory environment for speculative housebuilding and
   the construction of core competencies for brownfield development
SO ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING A
LA English
DT Article
ID RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT; INDUSTRY; DESIGN; SECTOR; POLICY; UK
AB Speculative housebuilding in the United Kingdom faces an ever tighter regulatory environment owing to the increasing impact of the sustainable development agenda. For example, 60% of all new homes in England are now expected to be constructed on previously developed land or provided through the conversion of existing buildings. As speculative housebuilders are responsible for about 80% of all new dwellings built in the United Kingdom, the achievement of this important government target is critically dependent on the ability and willingness of the private sector to respond to public policy. By exploring the main components of the residential development process, the author investigates how far speculative housebuilding will need to change to ensure the successful implementation of the government's brownfield housing target. He suggests that those speculative housebuilders that are enthusiastically building up core competencies in brownfield housing are likely to emerge as the market leaders of the future whereas those companies that continue to rely on past practices and technologies will face an uncertain future as greenfield development opportunities begin to reduce.

AB This paper describes participatory budgeting in Brazil and elsewhere as a significant area of innovation in democracy and local development. It draws on the experience of 25 municipalities in Latin America and Europe, selected based on the diversity of their participatory budgeting experience and their degree of innovation. The paper provides a systematic analysis of the range Of experience that can be included in participatory budgeting - in terms of the level of funds being considered, the extent Of control and mode of involvement of local citizens, the relationship with local government, the degree of institutionalization and the sustainability of the process - and it considers the questions that are raised by this diverse set of possibilities.

TI Providing environmental urban services to the poor in Andhra Pradesh:
   developing strategic decision-making
SO ENVIRONMENT AND URBANIZATION
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper describes an urban development programme in Andhra Pradesh, India, one of a new generation of programmes that aim to bring about more sustainable change for the poor within the framework of municipal government and other local institutions. The programme, funded by DFID and implemented through 32 local authorities, worked to improve municipal performancc, to fund environmental services for the poor and to strengthen civil society organizations. The paper discusses a participatory introspection in six of the municipalities through which change was assessed. Relationships among the stakeholders were found to have improved, municipal accountability was increased and civil society groups had become eager to take a greater role in decision-making. Women were especially affected (although there continue to be barriers to their participation): their networks grew, their analytical and collaborative skills increased and their input was acknowledged and appreciated. The paper considers the potential for sustaining the positive changes experienced through the programme, and offers some concrete suggestions.

AB Taiwan is one of the few Asian countries to have officially adopted Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) as one important means towards the achievement of environmental conservation and sustainable development. Despite implementation almost a decade ago, SEA remains premature in its development. This paper analyzes the progress and characteristics of SEA in Taiwan and, through examination of its limited case studies, reveals the positive and apparent influence of SEA on policy making. This paper also identifies the barriers hindering SEA's advancement and concludes with recommendations on strategies to overcome these obstacles. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Recently, much attention has been given to the notion of 'sustainable consumption'. Whereas environmental economics traditionally has focused environmental policy analysis on producers, this new notion broadens the perspective to include environmental policies aimed at directly influencing consumer decisions regarding buying, using, and recycling products. This could suggest policies that link not only to price incentives, but also and especially to persuasive instruments, such as education and information provision. These policies might take into account certain characteristics of households, such as lifestyle and family size. This article presents a first econometric analysis of consumption in the context of environmental sustainability. Relationships between different types of household expenditures and a range of household characteristics are assessed, based on a large micro data set of households for the Netherlands. Use is made of various demand models and econometric techniques to adequately address theoretical and technical issues involved. The article ends with a discussion of the implications of the results for environmental policy directed at stimulating sustainable consumption.

   MECHANISM
AB In this study several oil press cakes were investigated as exclusive substrates for different moulds and yeasts for the production of flavor-active decalactones via solid-state fermentation (SSF). Experiments are focused on pre-treatment methods for olive cake to remove antimicrobial phenolic substances contained in the oil cake disturbing or even inhibiting microbial growth. Choosing Ceratocystis moniliformis as the reference microorganism best results were obtained by a combination of hot water flushes and enzymatic treatment of the cake. Fermentation with sunflower, olive and linseed cake did not lead to lactone formation in detectable amounts although all of these substrates provided good microbial growth. On castor cake, however, five microorganisms have synthesized the requested decalactones via SSF Thus fermentation of the fungus Moniliella suaveolens on this substrate resulted in a maximum concentration of gamma-decalactone of 180.7 mg(.)kg(-1) dry matter without optimization. Another delta-lactone, 6-pentyl-alpha-pyrone, was produced in small amounts by the fungus Trichoderma harzianum on castor cake.

AB In recent years the urban question in the European Union has been a matter of deep focus and intensive debate, contributing to the European Community environmental, spatial and sustainability policies approach, however not entirely reflected in the current version of the 6th European Environmental Action Programme. The POLIS programme, initiated in Portugal at the time of the last Portuguese Presidency of the European Union (January-June 2000), illustrates the Portuguese urban environmental policy approach in that period, in response to contemporary trends and priorities regarding the improvement of urban life and governance. This article describes the POLIS programme, its current status and how it meets current challenges. ne expetience acquired so far with the POLIS programme may be useful in the broader context of the discussion of an European urban policy.

SO EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
AB The legume Arachis pintoi has a number of characteristics which enable it to make a valuable contribution to the development of sustainable and productive pastures in the tropics. It was introduced to Costa Rica for this reason, in 1987. The objective of this study was to analyse the adoption of A. pintoi as a forage legume in Huetar Norte, a region in the north of Costa Rica. The adoption process was analysed to identify the contributory factors and to make recommendations for measures which could be taken to promote the process. To collect the data, 115 randomly selected livestock holders and an additional 34 farmers known to have planted A. pintoi were interviewed. Farmers see improved pastures to be the most important technology to enhance forage and cattle production. It was confirmed that A. pintoi is a potential improved pasture alternative. Although A. pintoi was well known, the adoption rate was low. Lack of availability of seed, technical assistance and information about the use and management of A. pintoi hinder adoption. Difficulties in establishment and maintenance were also recorded.

TI The commercial fishery of the Peruvian Amazon
SO FISHERIES
LA English
DT Article
ID RIVER; BASIN
AB A combination of increased human population growth, high fish harvest pressure, and adoption of more technologically advanced fishing equipment by the commercial fleet has generated concerns about the sustainability of fish stocks in the Peruvian Amazon. We assessed the status of the commercial fishery by conducting interviews with officials of the Peruvian Ministry of Fisheries as well as with commercial and artisanal fishers. We also reviewed pertinent publications and agency reports written in one of three languages (Spanish, Portuguese, and English). Based on the trend toward smaller-sized fish and greater effort needed to achieve full capacity catches, we suggest the commercial fishery is beginning to show the classical signs of overfishing. More comprehensive data collection, stringent enforcement of management regulations, research on the influence of flood level on fish production, and development of an ecologically and genetically sound native-species aquaculture program are measures we recommend be adopted to protect and sustain the fishery resources of the Peruvian Amazon.

AB A major cause of the steep declines of American oyster (Crassostrea virginica) fisheries is the loss of oyster habitat through the use of dredges that have mined the reef substrata during a century of intense harvest. Experiments comparing the efficiency and habitat impacts of three alternative gears for harvesting oysters revealed differences among gear types that might be used to help improve the sustainability of commercial oyster fisheries. Hand harvesting by divers produced 25-32% more oysters per unit of time of fishing than traditional dredging and tonging, although the dive operation required two fishermen, rather than one. Per capita returns for dive operations may nonetheless be competitive with returns for other gears even in the short term if one person culling on deck can serve two or three divers. Dredging reduced the height of reef habitat by 34%, significantly more than the 23% reduction caused by tonging, both of which were greater than the 6% reduction induced by diver hand-harvesting. Thus, conservation of the essential habitat and sustainability of the subtidal oyster fishery can be enhanced by switching to diver hand-harvesting. Management schemes must intervene to drive the change in harvest methods because fishermen will face relatively high costs in making the switch and will not necessarily realize the long-term ecological benefits.

AB This paper contributes towards the construction and application of a method to assess the long-term impact of the development of pervasive technologies on the environment. It seeks to integrate insights from studies of technology regarding long-term growth with questions of sustainability. Using a methodology based on long-wave theory and a sector classification based on technological characteristics, the likely effects of the three pervasive technologies (information technology, biotechnology and nanotechnology) on the input-output structure of selected sectors and on the levels of emissions of industrial greenhouse gases are considered.

AB The objective of this study was to determine what patterns, if any, existed in the response of nitrifying enzyme activity (NEA), denitrifying enzyme activity (DEA), soil microbial N and soil inorganic N to elevated CO2 across a broad range of grassland environments. We studied the response of these N pools and microbial activities in four CO2-enrichment sites of the MEGARICH project (Managing European Grasslands as a Sustainable Resource in a Changing Climate). CO2 treatment was studied in factorial combination with a cutting frequency treatment at two sites and with a temperature treatment at one site. Our study showed that microbial biomass N, NEA, DEA and extractable soil [NH4+] and [NO3-] were generally not affected by elevated CO2 in these grassland ecosystems after several years of treatment, nor by cutting frequency or temperature at the sites that included these treatments. Exceptions to this were that DEA and soil [NO3-] decreased by 22% and 45%, respectively, at the French site at elevated CO2. We discuss the possible explanations for this lack of response.

TI Deep change: How operational innovation can transform your company
SO HARVARD BUSINESS REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB Breakthrough innovations- not just steady improvements-in operations can destroy competitors and shake up entire industries. Just look at Dell, Toyota, and WalMart. But fewer than 10% of large companies have made serious attempts to achieve operational innovation. Why?
   One reason, contends the author, is that business culture undervalues operations they're not as sexy as deals or acquisitions. in addition, many executives who rose through the ranks of finance or sales aren't familiar with operations-and they aren't interested in learning more. Finally, because no one holds the title Vice President of Operational Innovation, it doesn't have a natural home in the organization, so its easily overlooked.
   Fortunately, all of these barriers can be overcome. This article offers practical advice on how to develop operational innovations, such as looking for role models outside your industry to emulate and identifying-and then defying -constraining assumptions about how work should be done. The author also discusses the best way to implement operational innovations. For instance, because they are disruptive by nature, projects should be concentrated in those activities with the greatest impact on enterprise strategic goals.
   Operational innovation may feel unglamorous or unfamiliar to many executives, but it is the only lasting basis for superior performance. Executives who understand how operational innovation happens-and who understand the barriers that prevent it from happening -can add to their strategic arsenal one of the most powerful competitive weapons in existence. In an economy that has overdosed on hype and in which customers rule as never before, operational innovation offers a meaningful and sustainable way to get ahead-and stay ahead -of the pack.

ID PARTNERSHIPS; EXPLORATION; PLANS
AB Health care organizations often enter into a cooperative arrangement to create safety-net programs and coordinate care. Maintaining effective cooperation in such alliances poses special problems that can be examined using network analysis and explained in game theory terms. A mental health coalition case study is presented using network analysis and game theory interpretations. Had a positive-sum game approach been applied to the coalition's initial design, its subsequent suboptimal performance might have been averted. The application of network analysis plus a game theoretic paradigm has significant implications for improving both the design and the coordination of such coalitions.

TI Groundwater demand management at local scale in rural areas of India: a
   strategy to ensure water well sustainability based on aquifer
   diffusivity and community participation
SO HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
DE transmissivity; storage coefficient; diffusivity; groundwater
   management; aquifer depletion time
AB Watershed development programmes provide an opportunity for sustainable management strategies, although currently, they remain largely 'supply-side' mechanisms of water resources development. Hydrogeological conditions, community participation and status of groundwater usage are important in evolving strategies on 'demand-side' groundwater management.
   Neemkheda aquifer is a typical low-storage, low-hydraulic conductivity aquifer from a watershed in the dryland regions of Madhya Pradesh State of central India. A shallow unconfined aquifer, it consists of an upper coarse, calcareous sandstone unit underlain by a fine-grained sandstone unit. A 'well commune' of seven wells is poised to test the concept of joint groundwater management, wherein wells are mechanisms of tapping a common water source, the Neemkheda aquifer.
   The strategy for systematic groundwater management in the Neemkheda well commune is based upon the relationship between Transmissivity (T) and Storage coefficient (S), i.e. aquifer diffusivity, and its variation within the aquifer. Wells within a high diffusivity domain tend to dewater more quickly than wells within a low diffusivity domain. A well-use schedule during the dry season, based upon aquifer diffusivity forms the basis of the groundwater management concept. The distribution of local aquifer diffusivities governs the relationship between local and regional aquifer depletion times and forms the basis of the groundwater management exercise being proposed for the Neemkheda aquifer.

AB Risk assessments to assess the efficiency of management procedures to regulate removals of marine mammals have rarely been conducted. Using Bayesian methods, we conducted a risk assessment on a harvested beluga population off West Greenland. The population size in recent years was estimated to be 22% of the size in 1954. Results indicate that current catches are unsustainable and that continuation of this situation represents a 90% probability that the population will become extinct in 20 years. The analyses suggest that the harvest should be reduced to no more than 130 animals. Constant catch quotas represent a greater risk of depletion compared with catch limits that are a function of harvest rate and population size. An alternative gradual reduction schedule is proposed as a viable strategy, reducing the harvest in 5 years and adjusting the subsequent quota using a harvest rate of 0.5 of R-max, with updates in the abundance. This analysis is presented as an alternative for cases where an immediate catch reduction is desirable but not feasible for marine mammal populations that appear vulnerable or in danger and where catch and abundance data are available.

AB The corrosion cast and dry specimen are useful to study the architecture of different cavities, ducts, arteries, veins, ventricles and joints along with their dimensions and topography in various domestic animals and birds.
   In earlier days, such techniques were used with the help of paraffin, polyvinyl acetate and gelatin which were brittle and less durable. Hutchinson (1998) used colored gelatin for the corrosion cast of the bronchial tree in human beings.
   The present study is being conducted to validate the use of silicone paste and formalin vapour for preparation of sustainable corrosion Cast and dry specimens to teach and to conduct research in veterinary anatomy and also for the preservation of museum specimens.

AB This paper introduces a resource-based perspective (RBP) model on enterprise recourse planning (ERP) challenges to help make ERP decisions in China. While ERP aims at integrating functional-area information systems within a company into a coherent, enterprise-wide, and web-enabled network, its implementation is especially challenging to enterprises in China because of high implementation costs, technical complexity, lack of information technology infrastructure, lack of well-trained employees, lack of incentives to state-owned enterprises, and a corporate culture different from that in the West. A RBP of a firm, however, posits that firms should compete on the basis of unique corporate resources that are valuable, rare, difficult to imitate, and unsubstitutable. Thus, this research assesses major ERP challenges in China based upon a three-tier decision process in pursuit of a sustainable competitive advantage. This RBP model is then embedded with data from a survey research to illustrate potential applications and managerial implications.

AB Natural populations of Otatea acuminata (Munro) C.E. Calderon & Soderstr. subsp. aztecorum (McClure & E.W Smith) R. Guzman, Anaya & Santana-Michel were studied in the Sierra de Manantlan, Jalisco-Colima, in Western Mexico. The objectives were to compare the structure of otate populations at different harvesting levels, in order to evaluate the changes occurred due to management and to obtain the best prediction factor for culm production. Forty-one 50m(2) plots were randomly established in harvested and non-harvested stands, and were observed over a 2 year period. There was no significant difference between harvested and unharvested stands, but the latter had higher densities and longer stems on average. Culm diameter and height were significantly different according to soil type in a nonparametric ANOVA. A backward lineal regression analysis identified a prediction model for juvenile culms production. Present exploitation levels by artesans appear to be sustainable.

AB Efficient communications are necessary to maintain and build sustainable customer relationships. This paper shows how the communications can be optimized through the corporate site. The authors discuss three fields of knowledge-usability, human computer interaction (HCI) and branding-and demonstrate how each field alone is insufficient but taken together they can enlighten all perspectives of communication through the Internet. By measuring the relationships between user (customer) and site (firm), they show how usability, cultural background and group affiliation influence general perception. Based on these findings, the authors have developed a model, which incorporates usability, HCI and branding, to offer optimal communication through the corporate site. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Probabilistic population projections for India with explicit
   consideration of the education-fertility link
SO INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
DE India; population; education; projections; uncertainty
AB Among the different sources of uncertainty in population forecasting, uncertain changes in the structure of heterogeneous populations have received little attention so far, although they can have significant impacts. Here we focus on the effect of changes in the educational composition of the population on the overall fertility of the population in the presence of strong fertility differentials by education. With data from India we show that alternative paths of future female enrolment in education result in significantly different total fertility rates (TFR) for the country over the coming decades, even assuming identical fertility trends within each education group. These results from multi-state population projections by education are then translated into a fully probabilistic population projection for India in which the results of alternative education scenarios are assumed to expand the uncertainty range of the future TFR in the total population.
   This first attempt to endogenize structural change with respect to education-which is the greatest measurable source of fertility heterogeneity in Asia-has resulted from a larger exercise of the Asian MetaCentre for Population and Sustainable Development Analysis to collect empirical information, scientific arguments as well as informed opinions about likely future population trends in Asia from a large number of population experts in the region. In this process, future changes in the educational composition of the population have been identified as a key driver of future fertility.
   The actual probabilistic population projections for India show that with high certainty, the Indian population will continue to grow to about 1.3 billion over the next quarter of a century. After that the uncertainty will get much wider, ranging from a continued strong increase to the beginning of a population decline in India.

AB The paper considers the pressures faced by official statistics at the present time. As such, its emphasis is on current rather than intrinsic (time independent) issues. It discusses the six specific challenges. (1) Trust. Declining social trust poses a particular problem since their output would become close to useless without trust in statistical agencies (both in their professional competence and in their integrity to safeguard the statistical system from inappropriate political interference). However, this represents not only a pressure, but also an opportunity: governments' response to declining trust is more transparency and evidence-based decision making, which however requires trusted "information brokers". Possible responses to this opportunity are discussed. (2) Privacy. Developments in information technology and the pervasive character of the Internet have sharpened concerns about privacy. Yet, our role as "information brokers" critically depends on intensive exploitation of administrative records and their linkage with survey information. How we respond to this challenge will be a key determinant of our increasing or declining usefulness. (3) Social statistics. Social statistics are relatively underdeveloped-yet they are to inform decisions in an area that in most countries accounts the bulk of government expenditures. In order to be more relevant, we must shift our emphasis from measuring inputs and processes to illuminating outcomes and their underlying dynamics. Some examples of Canadian responses in this area are described. (4) Economic statistics and globalisation. There is a tension between our activities which are national in scope, and the activities of multinational corporations. The paper explores some ideas for coping with these challenges. (5). Environment statistics. While underdeveloped in most countries, the Kyoto accords and heightened interest in sustainability provide significant opportunities. The paper outlines the major elements of a statistical system needed to monitor sustainable development. (6) Finally, the paper concludes with consideration of some issues facing the international statistical system.

AB Zusammenfassung Goal of the network is the construction of an exemplary cooperative leukemia network for the improvement of medical care and of health related research in acute and chronic leukemias. This is achieved by improved mechanisms of cooperation among all major groups in Germany that deal with the leukemias in research and in patient care. In practice, cooperation between clinical groups and scientists in research institutes is mediated by various instruments that improve communication, flow of information and interdisciplinary cooperation and also increase information transfer from top research institutions to clinical translation. The network comprises more than 1400 participants in about 400 university centers, large community hospitals and specialty practices with functional communication structures, interdisciplinary cooperation and nation-wide logistics. The improved cooperation and the accelerated information transfer from the bench to the "bedside" results in an added value that ultimately results in improved survival results of patients and in superior competitiveness of involved research workers and clinicians. Sustainability is addressed by establishing a leukemia foundation to support long term financial coverage of the network and by negotiating a proposal for a European Network of Excellence against leukemia within the Sixth Framework Programme of the European Union.

TI Use of covariance structures for temporal errors in the analysis of a
   three-course wheat rotation and tillage trial
SO JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
ID YIELD
AB Crop rotation serves as a mechanism for developing sustainable crop production systems. Crop-rotation trials are used to identify agronomic input factors suitable for use in a cropping system. In crop-rotation trials, experimental errors within the same plot over time are correlated. The form of the covariance structure of the plot errors may be specific to the data from a rotation trial, but is unknown and is generally assumed. Statistical analyses are usually based on the assumption that plot errors are independent, or have constant covariance. An experiment was conducted using wheat-based, three-course rotations containing tillage treatment subplots over 12 years at ICARDA's experimental station at Tel Hadya, a moderately dry area in northern Syria. This study examined several covariance structures for temporal errors arising over the rotation plots and tillage subplots, in order to model wheat yield data. Eighteen covariance structures were examined, and the best pair was selected using the Akaike Information Criterion. The best pair comprised first-order autocorrelation and homogeneous variance for temporal errors in rotation plots, and uniform correlation with heterogeneous variances for temporal errors in tillage subplots. Using the 12 years of data obtained for wheat yield and the best pair of covariance structures, the tillage and rotation effects were found to be statistically significant and to have significant interactions with the cycle of rotation. The precision of the means calculated differed from those calculated using a control structure based on homogeneous error variances and constant correlation. The cumulative yield build-up over time differed significantly over the rotations and the tillage methods. An increasing yield trend was observed for the bread wheat rotation, while a yield decline was observed in durum wheat when the rotation was repeated. When evaluating the effects of input factors in crop rotations, we therefore recommend that the covariance structures be examined and that a suitably chosen structure be used.

ID INDIAN MAJOR CARPS; OREOCHROMIS-NILOTICUS; FISH BIOMASS; CULTURE;
   PRODUCTIVITY
AB The present study attempts to assess the potential of artificial substrates to enhance fish production in inland saline groundwater ponds through periphyton production. Grey mullet, Mugil cephalus, was cultured for 100 days in ponds with substrate (treatment ponds) and without substrate (control ponds). To enhance the surface area, bamboo poles were used as substrate. The periphyton population, pigment concentration and hydrobiological characteristics of pond water were monitored. The studies revealed little difference in most of the water quality parameters observed in the two treatments. However, turbidity (27.0+/-0.1-35.0+/-0.1 Nephalo Turbidity Unit (NTU)), chlorophyll 'a'(6.6+/-0.6-7.6+/-0.6 mug L-1), plankton population (phytoplankton 8.4x10(3)-9.4x10(3) numbers L-1; zooplankton 4.0x10(3)-5.1x10(3) numbers L-1) and NH4-N (2.0+/-0.2-2.3+/-0.1 mg L-1) were high in the treatment with no additional substrate; however, in the treatment with substrate the total Kjeldahl nitrogen (9.8+/-0.8-10.8+/-0.7 mg L-1) and o-PO4 (0.1+/-0.01-0.1 mg L-1) remained significantly (P<0.05) higher. Highest periphyton biomass in terms of dry matter (DM) (0.8+/-0.01-1.4+/-0.01 mg cm(-2)), ash free DM (0.4+/-0.0-0.6+/-0.01 mg cm(-2)), chlorophyll 'a' (3.1+/-0.2-8.1+/-0.8 mug cm(-2)) and pheophytin 'a' (1.9+/-0.4-3.9+/-0.5 mug cm(-2)) was observed at 50 cm depth in ponds provided with additional substrate. Fifteen plankton genera showing periphytic affinity colonized the bamboo substrates. Fish growth (mean fish weight 524.3+/-8.7 g and SGR 2.5+/-0.1) was significantly (P<0.05) higher in ponds provided with additional substrate compared with control ponds (387.2+/-6.0). Length-weight relationship (LWR) (W=cL(n)) also showed that the exponential value ('n') of length was high in substrate-supported ponds (n=2.36) in comparison with controls (n=1.09). These studies suggest that a periphyton-supported aquaculture system can be used successfully for the culture of herbivorous brackishwater fish species like M. cephalus in inland saline groundwaters and thus could contribute to the development of sound and sustainable aquaculture technology.

AB Claims have often been made that the quality of online buying experience Web site usability, product selection, the extent of customer confidence, and the quality of customer relationships - are crucial to the success of e-commerce firms. We posit that Web site usability and product selection can be competed away via imitation, while customer confidence and relationship services represent a sustainable competitive advantage. Evidence from the association between third-party ratings of online buying experience and firms' Tobin's q for a sample of 46 e-commerce firms during the period 1999 - 2000 is consistent with our posited hypotheses.

AB Pretreatment of shrimp shells was investigated in order to lower the costs and to improve the sustainability of chitin production. Physical pretreatment comprising drying, grinding and sieving is attractive for the recovery of 50% of shrimp protein as a dry powder. Pretreatment of shells by shearing in acidified water results in the removal of up to 60% of the protein and a reduction of their mineral content without a decrease in the chitin yield. Both pretreatment procedures will lead to cleaner technology for chitin production, to a considerably lower need for chemicals, to useful protein by-products, and to less-contaminated industrial effluent.

AB 2-Mercaptothiazoline (2-MT) is widely used as an organic corrosive as well as a diffusion inhibitor due to its high ability to form metal-chelate Schiff base complexes. This study investigated the elimination of 2-MT from aqueous systems with adsorption process to reach the goal of sustainable use of water resources. The Freundlich and Langmuir adsorption isotherms were adopted to examine the adsorption behavior of two types of 2-MT (i.e., 2-MT molecule and 2-MT complex) on activated carbon (AC) Chemviron Filtrasorb 400 (F 400) in three different solutions. The results of adsorption isotherm data showed that the adsorption ability of 2-MT molecule is much higher than that of 2-MT complex, whose ability may be reduced due to the electrostatic repulsion. The good applicability of Langmuir adsorption isotherm to experimental data indicated that the adsorption of 2-MT complexes on F 400 might be limited to a monolayer. Higher ionic strength and lower pH value of the solutions promoted the uptake of 2-MT onto F 400 from the solutions. In addition, not only 2-MT molecule and complex but also Cu(II) can be adsorbed on the surface of F 400, which was demonstrated by energy dispersive analysis of X-ray (EDAX). Effects of the two major interactions, chemical and physical interactions, on the adsorption of 2-MT on F 400 were compared as well in this study. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Analytical model is proposed to account for carbon emission behavior during replacement of power source from fossil to renewable energy in which sustainability of energy supply is stressed. Analyses show that energy payback time (EPT) should be much shorter than the doubling time of manufacturing cycle to secure adequate available energy during as well as after the replacement. Nuclear small hydropower and photovoltaic cell are taken as representative candidates and investigated as an option to replace fossil power until mid-century. Nuclear and small hydropower can be promising candidates but photovoltaic cell needs further development efforts to reduce EPT to avoid energy expense after the replacement.

TI An assessment of Turkish Deltaic landscapes regarding environmental
   conservation and sustainable management - A case study of the Kizilirmak
   Delta
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE Deltaic landscapes; coastal wetlands; degradation; Turkey; conservation
   and management.
AB Deltas, as macro and micro biological systems at high productive levels, are the natural reserve areas of the world. Those in Turkey present the international importance landscapes as to the various ecosystem characteristics and land use patterns. Nevertheless, these areas are currently facing many problems such as biodiversity loss and environmental degradation owing to coastal settlements and pollution factors. This paper describes the factors responsible for the main features and degradation types of the Deltaic landscapes and their impact for future land use. It also deals with : an overview of the Kizilirmak Delta, one of the most important Deltas along the central part of Black Sea Region (Turkey); presents major ecosystem of it; identifies land use pattern and discusses the threats by environmental and human induced disturbances, The most considering feature of this Delta is to show the largest and most significant wetland area of Turkey which has been able to protect its natural beauties on the Black Sea Coasts. A Delta plain of 56 000 hectares extends through the area at the north of the Samsun-Sinop highway. The ecological system of the Delta is extremely rich in terms of its biological variety as well as its fauna (especially number of bird species). But, the Delta including terrestrial areas close to the water resources and the vegetation between aquatic and terrestrial systems, has been constantly modified by human activities. Consequently, some considerations for environmental conservation and sustainable management were put forward for the future generations.

TI Grain legumes for soil productivity improvement in the Northern Guinea
   savanna of Nigeria
SO JOURNAL OF FOOD AGRICULTURE & ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE Soil restoration; soil moisture conservation; sustainable crop and
   livestock production; sustainable soil management
ID ZONE
AB The Nigerian savanna zone is currently witnessing increasing intensities of crop and livestock production activities that are resulting in increased soil erosion, de-vegetation of the land area, and desert encroachment especially during the dry season. These may have led to the presence of several over-grazed and bare ground areas that is highly susceptible to soil erosion. At harvest, both crop and residues are removed from the field, thus limiting potential nutrient recycling between crop and soil, and further impoverishing the nutrient status of the soils. The Nigerian savanna zone soils therefore have low total nitrogen, organic carbon, available phosphorus and cation exchange capacity. They also have very poor moisture holding capacity, and are therefore said to have poor fertility status and very low buffering capacity. The present study aimed to determine effects of grain legumes on soil potential in the arid systems was therefore imposed on the soils in the Zaria area. Results show that sole legumes and legume/maize treatments generally resulted in higher organic carbon contribution than sole maize treatment, suggesting that sole maize grown continuously on one farm for years could degrade the organic carbon content of the soil. Also, the sole legume and legume/maize treatments resulted in improvements in soil nitrogen in the range between 65.6 and 84.8 %, while nitrogen under sole maize resulted in only 5.9 % increase. In 2001, groundnut/maize intercrop resulted in significantly higher maize grain yield (1.49 t ha(-1)) than the other treatments. Comparing between maize grain yields in 2001 and 2002, maize grain improved by 20.1% under sole maize, 95.0% under maize in sole groundnut, 92.8% under maize in soybean, and 98.4% under maize in cowpea. This would confirm that the sole legume planting for two years restored fertility status of the soils and enhanced the soil organic carbon and total nitrogen, to have resulted in greater maize grain yield than under the sole maize despite the 120 kg N fertilizer applied to the sole maize.

TI SWOT analysis of extension systems in Asian and West African countries
SO JOURNAL OF FOOD AGRICULTURE & ENVIRONMENT

DT Article
DE extension systems; Asia; West Africa; SWOT; extension linkage;
   organization; management
AB This paper presents an analysis of the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats to extension organizations in Japan, China, Thailand, Nigeria, Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana. This is based on the fact that there are new emerging roles of extension services, need for improved performance, as well as the need to re-position the organizations for future challenges. Some of the strengths are strong linkage among research, extension and farmers, complete organization from national to township level, extensive coverage of farming population, and high feasibility of plans while weaknesses include limited use of alternative extension methods, insufficient cooperation, and coordination with other agencies, high bureaucratic setting, and poor financial decentralization. On the other hand the opportunities that can be explored are potential for improved effectiveness and efficiency through transformations, emergence of private extension services providers and potential for effective programme implementation. The threats to these organizations include too rigid structure, limited use of alternative extension methods, multiplicity of extension advisors roles and inadequate budget. The paper recommends that the extension managers and policy makers should focus on the identified strengths, weakness, opportunities, and threats with a view of evolving an effective and sustainable extension system.

ID GOBRA ZEBU; CATTLE; NDAMA
AB In tsetse and trypanosomiasis (T&T) infested areas and countries the poverty and food security status of communities is rather heterogeneous and so is the impact of trypanosomiasis on the agricultural production process. Therefore, intervention to reduce or eliminate the impact of the disease requires, beyond an analysis of technical feasibility, a full appreciation of the causal relationship between poverty and the tsetse related development constraints. T&T intervention needs to be conceived and implemented in the context of sustainable agriculture and rural development (SARD). Hence, areas are selected not just on technical grounds but, most importantly, on the basis of their potential for sustainable and improved agricultural production. Under the umbrella of the Programme Against African Trypanosomiasis, and in collaboration with the Pan African Tsetse and Trypanosomiasis Eradication Campaign of the African Union, a set of criteria and guiding principles for prioritisation of intervention areas has been established to facilitate this approach. In order to maximise benefits of interventions, a concept for Area-Wide Integrated Pest Management (AW-IPM) has been developed. AW-IPM targets at the entire pest population and capitalises on locally prevailing factors and favourable trends (agro-ecological, climatic and demographic) assisting a reduction of fly challenge and disease risk. Substantial benefits from interventions against T&T are predicted for the mixed crop-livestock systems of the "cotton belt" running through parts of Burkina Faso and Mali, and the Southern Rift Valley of Ethiopia. Blending the technical AW-IPM approach and the SARD policy increases the chances of technical success, yields maximal economic returns which, in turn, paves the road for a move away from subsistence and towards market agricultural practices.

AB The elimination of olive-mill wastewater (OMW) is one of the main environmental problems related to the olive oil industry of Mediterranean countries. The OMW is collected in lagoons with the aim of reducing the volume by evaporation to obtain the dry olive-mill wastewater (DOMW). To solve the problem of OMW elimination, both purification and recycling processes have been the most suitable procedure. Manure application as organic amendment of horticultural crops under greenhouse cultivation could be substituted by DOMW. This material is an unbalanced fertilizer. However, by means of fertigation the soil solution can be balanced. The experiment was carried out by growing pepper plants (Capsicum annuum L. Lamuyo var. Drago) in a polyethylene-covered greenhouse located in La Canada, Almeria, Spain. The trial included three replications of four amendment treatments: 1) W without organic material, 2) DOMW dry extract of olive milk wastewater (13.1 kg m(-2)), 3) DOMW (6.5 kg m(-2)) + peat (4.6 kg m(-2)) and 4) M manure (10 kg m(-2)). Water fraction, organic material and mineral elements in amendment materials (DOMW, peat and manure) and their saturated extracts were analyzed. During the crop production irrigation water, nutrient solution and soil solution obtained by suction cups were analysed for pH, E.C., nitrate, phosphate, sulphate, chloride, potassium, calcium, magnesium and sodium. Fruit production was evaluated by quality. It was concluded that DOMW is sustainable as soil amendment for horticultural greenhouse crops without reduction in the production, and even improves the fruit size. DOMW amendment produces a moderate reduction in the soil solution pH, potassium and chloride concentrations are similar, calcium higher and sodium lower than by manure application.

AB Indigenous knowledge and practices are important aspects of a society's culture and its technology. They include accumulated knowledge, as well as skills and technology of the local people, usually derived from their direct interaction with their local environment. These aspects need due recognition and full understanding and utilization because of the valuable contributions to food security, especially in African communities. Africa's people have traditionally utilized indigenous knowledge, skills and structures, most often locally developed and handed down in the course of centuries. Insufficient attention has been given to this local knowledge within the mainstream food security development and management interventions. However, there is now increasing awareness of the fact that technology includes not only energy sources and tools, but also knowledge and skills, as well as social organizations. It is, therefore, imperative to approach indigenous communities as partners and collaborators in all food security endeavors in order to realize the objective of sustainability. African communities offer a vast array of indigenous knowledge and practices in food technology that are favorable to the food supply, as well as to food quality and food safety and thus directly contribute to food security. As such, indigenous knowledge and practices in food technology that have proved capable of ensuring food security need to be implemented before considering the introduction of external ones if food security is to be realized in Africa. Emphasis of the same should be especially made for foods that are adapted to local conditions thus improving food access, safe food availability, and utilization to meet local and regional needs. This paper seeks to outline the numerous contributions and enormous potentials that indigenous knowledge and practices in food technology have in ensuring food security in Africa.

ID ECOSYSTEM MANAGEMENT; INDICATORS
AB We reviewed sustainable forestry certification programs and the literature to identify metrics relevant to biodiversity considerations. Two certification approaches emerged, one based on an organization's management processes and one based,,on measurements of forest components against desired outcomes. However, there was little documentation of why certain metrics were chosen for either approach. A common theme in the literature was concern with the criteria for selecting metrics rather than,recommendations of specific metrics. Biodiversity conservation plans and metrics should reflect landowner goals and address societal concerns as well as ecological considerations.

ID PROJECT
AB China is gradually opening up its engineering construction services sector to overseas contractors and consultants as part of its move towards joining the World Trade Organization (WTO). Traditionally, design institutes have operated as state-owned enterprises (SOEs), and for them, China's accession to the WTO in 2001 presents both a threat as well as an opportunity. Given the market conditions in China, most of the design institutes are restructuring their organizations to cope with the increasing competition. Through a pilot investigation, the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of the Chinese design institutes are identified. Based on the analysis, this paper proposes development strategies for the sustainable growth of Chinese design institutes and suggests approaches for collaboration with foreign contractors and consultants. A case study is presented to demonstrate the practical application of these strategies.

AB In most models of population dynamics, increases in population due to birth are assumed to be time-independent, but many species reproduce only during a single period of the year. We propose an exploited single-species model with stage structure for the dynamics in a fish population for which births occur in a single pulse once per time period. Since birth pulse populations are often characterized with a discrete time dynamical system determined by its Poincare map, we explore the consequences of harvest timing to equilibrium population sizes under seasonal dependence and obtain threshold conditions for their stability, and show that the timing of harvesting has a strong impact on the persistence of the fish population, on the volume of mature fish stock and on the maximum annual-sustainable yield. Moreover, our results imply that the population can sustain much higher harvest rates if the mature fish is removed as early in the season (after the birth pulse) as possible. Further, the effects of harvesting effort and harvest timing on the dynamical complexity are also investigated. Bifurcation diagrams are constructed with the birth rate (or harvesting effort or harvest timing) as the bifurcation parameter, and these are observed to display rich structure, including chaotic bands with periodic windows, pitch-fork and tangent bifurcations, non-unique dynamics (meaning that several attractors coexist) and attractor crisis. This suggests that birth pulse, in effect, provides a natural period or cyclicity that makes the dynamical behavior more complex.

TI First evaluation of the NHS direct online clinical enquiry service: A
   nurse-led web chat triage service for the public
SO JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE E-health; telemedicine; web chat; triage; NHS direct online
ID INTERNET; HIV
AB Background: NHS Direct is a telephone triage service used by the UK public to contact a nurse for any kind of health problem. NHS Direct Online (NHSDO) extends NHS Direct, allowing the telephone to be replaced by the Internet, and introducing new opportunities for informing patients about their health. One NHSDO service under development is the Clinical Enquiry Service (CES), which uses Web chat as the communication medium.
   Objective: To identify the opportunities and possible risks of such a service by exploring its safety, feasibility, and patient perceptions about using Web chat to contact a nurse.
   Methods: During a six-day pilot performed in an inner-city general practice in Coventry, non-urgent patients attending their GP were asked to test the service. After filling out three Web forms, patients used a simple Web chat application to communicate with trained NHS Direct triage nurses, who responded with appropriate triage advice. All patients were seen by their GP immediately after using the Web chat service. Safety was explored by comparing the nurse triage end point with the GP's recommended end point. In order to check the feasibility of the service, we measured the duration of the chat session. Patient perceptions were measured before and after using the service through a modified Telemedicine Perception Questionnaire (TMPQ) instrument. All patients were observed by a researcher who captured any comments and, if necessary, to assisted with the process.
   Results: A total of 25 patients (mean age 48 years; 57% female) agreed to participate in the study. An exact match between the nurse and the GP end point was found in 45% (10/22) of cases. In two cases, the CES nurse proposed a less urgent end point than the GP. The median duration of Web chat sessions was 30 minutes, twice the median for NHS Direct telephone calls for 360 patients with similar presenting problems. There was a significant improvement in patients' perception of CES after using the service (mean pre-test TMPQ score 44/60, post-test 49/60; p=0.008 (2-tailed)). Patients volunteered several potential advantages of CES, such as the ability to re-read the answers from the nurse. Patients consider CES a useful addition to regular care, but not a replacement for it.
   Conclusions: Based on this pilot, we can conclude that CES was sufficiently safe to continue piloting, but in order to make further judgments about safety, more tests with urgent cases should be performed. The Web chat sessions as conducted were too long and therefore too expensive to be sustainable in the NHS. However, the positive reaction from patients and the potential of CES for specific patient groups (the deaf, shy, or socially isolated) encourage us to continue with piloting such innovative communication methods with the public.

TI Is India's public finance unsustainable? Or, are the claims exaggerated?

AB Growing concerns about the sustainability of the fiscal policy in India have evoked serious concerns in the recent past. The present paper has assessed the Indian fiscal trends in terms of inter-temporal budget constraint (IBC) for the Central and State Governments separately and together by employing Gregory and Hansen [J. Econometrics 70 (1996) 99] tests of co-integration with structural breaks. By addressing the issue of regime shift, this paper finds that while the fiscal stance of the Central and the State Government at the individual level is unsustainable, it is weakly sustainable for the combined finances as it nets out inter-governmental financial flows. Thus, claims about sustainability of India's public finance, made on the basis of the assessment of individual finances and neglecting inter-governmental flows and the possibility of regime shifts seems exaggerated.

AB A standardized dermatology vocabulary is central to our collective ability to gather clinical information consistently for patient care, to retrieve information for research or disease management, as well as to conduct outcomes analysis for quality improvement. The deficiencies Of Current classifications have been recognized by the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS) in their decision to fund the development of a standard complete reference terminology for dermatology. The Dermatology Lexicon will have a major impact both on clinical care and on dermatologic research. Accuracy in medical records and telemedicine communications will be improved. Reliable terminology will provide for more complete and consistent documentation and data aggregation and reporting. In order to create a useful, sustainable lexicon, involvement of the dermatology community is essential.

AB This paper discusses the conceptual model and selected results of a study performed between November 1999 and January 2000 for the commission 'Common Security and Future of the Bundeswehr'-better known for its chairman as the 'Weizsacker Commission'-which was tasked by the 'red-green' coalition government elected in 1998 to develop recommendations for a new German force structure capable of addressing, together with its allies, future security risks to the Federal Republic of Germany and its national interests, and for improving the efficiency in managing daily operations. The methodological approach of the study is typical of concepts applied in Quick Response Analyses in support of defence planning. It uses straightforward analytical models for estimating the limits of the multi-dimensional decision space which encompass feasible planning options. Among others, the decision variables include the sustained defence budget level, force size, personnel structure, and design mission capability in terms of both quantity and quality. Based on the conclusions of the commission, that alliance/coalition crisis response operations 'out-of-area' (CRO) characterize the design mission for the future Bundeswehr, the quantity of mission capability is measured in terms of the service manpower that the Bundeswehr is able to contribute to sustained CRO, the quality in terms of sustained capital investment and non-personnel operating expenditures per active service man/woman relative to the respective expenditures of a capable alliance/coalition partner as a measure of the degree of interoperability that may be reached in the long term. The need for a far-reaching reform of the Bundeswehr was underscored by the result that a sustained defence budget of at least 50% above the 1999 level in real terms would be required in order for the Bundeswehr to come within 20% of the mission quality level that British forces would reach if the United Kindom were to sustain defence expenditures on the level of 1999. In addition, the sustainable CRO capability of the Bundeswehr was limited in quantitative terms to less than five percent of its total military manpower because of the significant percentage of conscripts in the peacetime force who are ineligible for CRO deployment while simultaneously requiring volunteers for their training. If-as assumed at the time of the study-future German defence expenditures were sustained at the 1999 level in real terms, the reform model adopted in May 2000 by then Defence Minister Scharping would have permitted an improvement of mission capability by 55% in terms of quantity and by 40% in terms of quality, that is, to about 55% of the British quality level. However, due to further budget cuts since then and because of inflation, the German defence budget will decline in real terms to about 90% of the 1999 budget by the year 2006. Simultaneously, the savings expected from the 15% reduction of both military and civilian personnel foreseen by the Scharping concept will be eaten up by increased personnel expenditures. No significant improvement of quality of mission capability is possible under these circumstances. This is why the new Defence Minister Peter Struck has, on I October 2003, announced further cuts in personnel levels and changes in personnel structure that come close to the recommendations of the Weizsacker Commission dismissed 3 years ago.

AB The collaborative program of the Transcultural Psychosocial Organization (TPO) provides a community-oriented and culturally sensitive public health response to the psychosocial problems of refugees and victims of organized violence. This paper describes the 9-step model that TPO has developed as a blueprint for each new intervention. Beneficiaries participate in determining priorities and there is an orientation toward culturally competent training, capacity-building, and sustainability. Two cases, one related to Sudanese refugees in Uganda and the other to internally displaced persons and returnees in postwar Cambodia, show how the TPO intervention protocol is adapted to local settings. The paper provides preliminary evaluative comments on the model's performance.

AB Coastal afforestation in Bangladesh was initiated in 1996 with pioneer species Sonneratia apetala and Avicennia officinalis. Tree species, Excoecaria agallocha, Heritiera fomes and Xylocarpus mekongensis, shrub species, Cynometra ramiflora and Lumnitzera racemosa; and palm species, Phoenix paludosa and Nypa fruticans were suitable for second rotation crops. A survival of 90.3% for E. agallocha, 84.7% for H. fomes and 58.3% for X. mekongensis was recorded. Mean annual height increments of these species were 1.03, 0.59 and 0.14 m and diameter increments 0.92, 0.39 and 0.15 cm respectively. Survivals for C. ramiflora, L. racemosa, P paludosa and N. fruticans were 59.0, 51.3, 84.7 and 97.3% respectively. On relatively raised lands, non-mangrove species, namely Acacia nilotica, Casuarina equisetifolia, Pithecellobium dulce, Samanea saman, Albizia lebbeck and A. procera were promising. After eight years, these species had a survival of 69, 65, 85, 61, 60 and 19% respectively with good height and diameter increments. Thus, a sustainable forest cover in the coastal areas of Bangladesh can be ensured.

AB In the Than lagoon, despite there being no phosphate limitation policy, the annual mean phosphate concentrations decreased by 90% between 1971 and 1994. The present study indicates a relationship between the decrease of phosphate concentrations and changes in urban, industrial and agricultural activities within the catchment generating phosphorus (P) inputs; and shellfish farming leading to phosphorus storage and export. The relationship (tonnes of P) is: P-PO43- in the lagoon waters = 1.0124 anthropogenic phosphorus balance - 47.62 (r(2) = 0.824, p < 0.000). As population growth is expected in coastal zones, sustainable development requires the need for addressing the role played by human activities and the multi-scale regulation of them. As an element of integrated coastal zone management, the present study provides a regional scale analysis of these aspects. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB CONTEXT The perinatal mortality rate (PMR) in Macedonia is among the highest in Europe. The World Bank supported a consultant (HEJ) to collaborate with a Macedonian team to develop a national perinatal strategy with the goal of reducing the PMR. Education was given priority in the form of a hospital-based initiative to develop the capacity of health professionals to introduce evidence-based perinatal practice into 16 participating hospitals. A 'train the teachers' approach was used, with trainees introduced to modern education and clinical practice in Sydney and subsequently supported to train their colleagues in Skopje.
   OBJECTIVES To describe the development, implementation and evaluation of the educational intervention.
   METHODS A curriculum, based on specific Macedonian needs, was developed in order to integrate teaching in the knowledge, skills and attitudinal domains of learning, using small group, interactive techniques. Twenty-five Macedonian doctors and nurses participated in 4-month (phase 1a) and 6-month (phase 1b) teaching programmes at a tertiary perinatal unit in Sydney. Australian staff conducted 4 2-week modules for 36 trainees in Macedonia (phase 2). The phase 1 trainees conducted 8 modules for 57 colleagues in Skopje (phase 3). The intervention was evaluated by trainee questionnaires, assessments of competence, changes in hospital practice and pre- (1997-99) and post-intervention (2000-01) comparisons of PMR.
   RESULTS A total of 115 doctors and nurses graduated from the programme. Positive responses to the education programme exceeded 80%. Evidence-based practice in 16 participating hospitals (covering 91% of all Macedonian births) was verified in 6 key areas of neonatology. The PMR fell significantly from 27.4 to 21.5 per 1000 births (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.73, 0.85). The early neonatal death rate in babies weighing over 1000 g fell by 36%.
   CONCLUSIONS The intervention has increased the capacity of Macedonians to practise best-evidence perinatal medicine and improve outcomes. Sustainability is predicted by the 'train the teachers' approach, with concurrent strengthening of the infrastructure and organisational framework.

AB The biological function of cellular prion protein PrPc has not been established, despite hi vitro studies suggesting antioxidant activity or link to signal transduction pathways. In this study, mice were exposed to hyperoxia to establish whether oxidative stress affected prion expression in vivo. C57BI/6J mice aged 6, 18, and 24 months. maintained under normoxic conditions, exhibited age-related increases in PrPc in both cerebral microvessels and in microvessel-depleted brain homogenate. We demonstrate that PrPc is differentially affected by exposure to hyperoxia hi vivo for 1. (24 h) or 2 (48 h) days, or for 1 day hyperoxia, followed by 1 day normoxia. Brain parenchymal cells from 6-month-old mice exposed to 1 day hyperoxia showed elevation of a glycosylated similar to36 kDa form, whereas in 24-month-old mice cellular prion level was substantially reduced. Extending hyperoxia from 1 to 2 days resulted in significantly reduced PrPc level, regardless of age. Parenchymal PrPc is substantially elevated in 6-month-old mice. but declines in 18- and 24-month-old animals following 1 day hyperoxia. By contrast, PrPc content in cerebral microvessels from 6-month-old mice declined after a 2 day exposure to hyperoxia, white microvessels from 24-month-old brains showed elevated prion levels 24 h after hyperoxia. Moreover, unglycosylated 25-30 kDa PrPc, and a previously undescribed 50-64 kDa band containing at least some glycosylated protein. predominated in microvessels with lesser content of the glycosylated similar to36 kDa form. Cellular content. of these unglycosylated forms was correlated with age, while the response to hyperoxia was evident in both unglycosylated and glycosylated forms of the protein following 1 and 2 day exposures. The observed elevation of the 25-30 and 50-64 kDa bands of microvessel PrPc is not sustainable following 1 day hyperoxia, but returns to near normoxic levels within 24 h after hyperoxia. We also show in a knockout mouse for methionine sulfoxide reductase (MsrA). the enzyme responsible for reducing methionine sulfoxide back to methionine. and a regulator of cellular antioxidant defence, that following hyperoxia brain PrPc in the null mutant is elevated relative to PrPc content in the parent strain. Our results show up-regulated PrPc expression or reduced turnover in response to age-related, and hyperoxia-induced oxidative stress.

DE environment; legislation; sustainable development
AB The principle of best practicable environmental option (BPEO) has its roots in the 1975 recommendations made by the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution, a new approach to pollution control. Since then BPEO has had a bumpy ride, failing to be clearly defined in law and applied equally and logically 'across the board'. This paper discusses the various issues surrounding BPEO, with particular emphasis on the nuclear industry, and suggesting ways forward for the future.

AB Nuclear power has many advantages, among them at least two that directly flow front the uranium energy source itself-the low cost of the natural uranium. as a proportion of overall generating costs, and the small amount of fuel necessary to provide very large amounts of energy. However, some recent Publications have promoted the view that limited supplies of natural uranium are the Achilles heel of nuclear power as the sector contemplates a larger contribution to future clean energy. This paper summarises some of the perspectives and analysis that support the following conclusion: uranium supply, like that for other metals, is economically sustainable. This means that normally functioning metals markets and technology change provide the drivers to ensure that supply at costs affordable to consumers is continuously replenished, both through the discovery of new resources and the redefinition (in economic terms) of known ones.

AB The Alberta oil-sands bitumen deposits comprise one of the largest sources of hydrocarbon in the world, and have emerged as the fastest-growing, soon to be dominant, source of crude oil in Canada. Although the oil industry has made great strides in improving the effectiveness of gathering this resource, the main challenge that remains is the large quantity of energy needed in the process of extracting the oil and upgrading it to commercial levels. However, over the past few years, developments in oil-sands extraction technology, and developments in CANDU technology through the advanced CANDU reactor, (ACR(TM)), have converged so that a practical, economical match of nuclear energy to the oil sands is now available. This paper describes recent studies by Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (AECL) and by the Canadian Energy Research Institute (CERI) to look at the adaptation of the ACR design for use in the oil sands, in particular with regard to economic viability. Issues raised in these studies are discussed, along with priorities for further work.

AB Sustainable agriculture is essential for man's survival, especially given our rapidly increasing population. Expansion of agriculture into remaining areas of natural vegetation is undesirable, as this would reduce biodiversity on the planet. Maintaining or indeed improving crop yields on existing farmed land, whether on a smallholder scale or on larger farms, is thus necessary. One of the limiting factors is often weed control; biological control of weeds is generally of limited use and mechanical control is either often difficult with machinery or very laborious by hand. Thus the use of herbicides has become very important. Minimum cultivation can also be important, as it reduces the power required to work the soil, limits erosion and helps to maintain the organic matter content of the soil. This last aspect helps preserve both the structure of soil and its populations of organisms, and also sustains the Earth's soil as a massive sink for carbon, an important consideration in the light of global warming. The introduction of the bipyridinium herbicide paraquat in the early 1960s greatly facilitated weed control in many crops. Paraquat has the unusual property of being active only by direct spray onto plants and not by uptake from soil in which strong binding deactivates it. Together with its rapid action in light in killing green plant tissue, such properties allow paraquat to be used in many crops, including those grown by low-tillage methods. This paper reviews the ways in which agricultural systems have been and are being developed to make use of these properties, and provides a risk/benefit analysis of the world-wide use of paraquat over nearly 40 years.

AB Over the last decade all English local authorities have developed strategies for a sustainable local environment in line with Local Agenda 21 (LA21) principles. Under New Labour, local government is being modernised, creating opportunities to advance LA21 from process to strategy. The article examines local environmental governance after LA21 in three local authority areas in northern England: Manchester, Leeds and Lancashire. Drawing on neo-Gramscian state theory and its concept of the spatial selectivity of the national state, emphasis is placed on an actual local politics of environmental policy making vis-a-vis the ideal of ecological modernisation. Local environmental strategies are not only linked to changing national priorities but also reflect the particular economic, environmental and political challenges impacting on decision making in each locality. The concept of local state strategic selectivity is proposed.

ID SUBSTITUTION; SEPARABILITY; ELASTICITIES; ENERGY; DEMAND
AB For over a century and a half, there have been cyclical phases of saturation and shortage in the numbers of students enrolled at German and Prussian universities. Starting from this observations, this article constructs a neoclassical glutting theory. A two-fold hypothesis is put forward. Firstly, the behaviour of students in their choice of curriculum depends on the expected rewards. Indeed, the allocation of students to the various faculties depends on the comparative yields of the latter in terms of expected earnings and job availability in the corresponding professional sectors. Thus, the rewards expected by a student are represented by the earnings on the labour market at a given moment and that he or she considers to be sustainable in time. Secondly, an attraction phenomenon may appear for certain curricula when a shortage occurs in different professional sectors. Once the shortage has been made up, the demand effect continues as a result of delay in the perception of the situation by young people. This may gradually lead to comparative over-production of qualified university leavers. This unbalanced situation diverts new cohorts of students to other sectors of education and may cause a new shortage, finally resulting in a cyclical movement modulated according to job availability.

TI Influencing sceptical staff to become supporters of service improvement:
   a qualitative study of doctors' and managers' views
SO QUALITY & SAFETY IN HEALTH CARE
LA English
DT Article
ID HEALTH-CARE
AB Objective: To explore scepticism and resistance towards changes in working practice designed to achieve service improvement. Two principal questions were studied: (1) why some people are sceptical or resistant towards improvement programmes and (2) what influences them to change their minds.
   Methods: Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with 19 clinicians and 19 managers who held national and regional roles in two national programmes of service improvement within the NHS involving systematic organisational changes in working practices: the National Booking Programme and the Cancer Services Collaborative (now the Cancer Services Collaborative Improvement Partnership).
   Results: Scepticism and resistance exist in all staff groups, especially among medical staff. Reasons include personal reluctance to change, misunderstanding of the aims of improvement programmes, and a dislike of the methods by which programmes have been promoted. Sceptical staff can be influenced to become involved in improvement, but this usually takes time. Newly won support may be fragile, requiring ongoing evidence of benefits to be maintained.
   Conclusions: The support of health service staff, particularly doctors, is crucial to the spread and sustainability of the modernisation agenda. Scepticism and resistance are seen to hamper progress. Leaders of improvement initiatives need to recognise the impact of scepticism and resistance, and to consider ways in which staff can become positively engaged in change.

TI Current practice in the strategic environmental assessment of
   development plans in England
SO REGIONAL STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
DE environmental appraisal; sustainability appraisal; development plans;
   strategic environmental assessment
AB In the UK, strategic environmental assessment has been applied to the full hierarchy of development plans in the form of environmental appraisal. Government guidance in England contains a forceful recommendation to local planning authorities to assess the environmental effects of proposed development plans by carrying out an environmental appraisal of their policies and proposals. This advice has grown in importance with the adoption of the European Directive on strategic environmental assessment. Research undertaken into current appraisal practice provides a context for the implementation of the Directive in England. The results show a broadly positive outlook towards strategic environmental assessment and a move towards using sustainability appraisal. Furthermore, they show other benefits from the process additional to assessing the core environmental impacts of the plan. However, it is clear that there remain major structural weaknesses and concerns in the manner in which strategic environmental assessment processes are implemented. Thus, more than two-thirds of the respondents to a survey stated that the appraisal had little or no influence on development plan objectives and policies, and nearly two-thirds believed that their plan would have developed in the same manner without any appraisal having been undertaken.

ID CADMIUM; FLOWS
AB Large amounts of recovered waste wood (RWW) originating from construction and demolition activities (C&DWW) and industrial activities (IWW) are annually generated in Sweden. RWW is also imported for use as an energy source at biofuel boilers. Increased use of biomass is one strategy to decrease environmental impact, in general, and the emissions of green house gases, in particular. This study addresses the environmental and resource implications of metal occurrence in RWW that is used as an energy source at biofuel boilers. RWW contains elevated concentrations of arsenic, chromium, copper, zinc, mercury, nickel, lead and possibly cadmium. The metal composition of Swedish and imported RWW differs in that Swedish RWW contains higher concentrations of arsenic, chromium, zinc, nickel and copper, while imported RWW contains higher concentrations of lead, mercury and cadmium. Ashes from combustion of RWW are nowadays generally disposed in landfills due to their elevated metal concentrations. This practice makes it impossible to use these ashes as filler material thereby replacing extraction of raw materials and decreasing the need for landfill space. Furthermore, landfilling leads to accumulation of hazardous heavy metals that poses a future environmental and health problem. If RWW from construction and demolition should contribute optimally to a sustainable energy system, cleaner waste wood flows are a prerequisite. The elementary measure is to track potential pollution sources in this waste stream and find out which are significant. Furthermore, since most of the RWW is untreated and unpolluted wood, there is a great environmental potential to separate this flow through the waste management system. Such an approach might lead to decreased environmental pollution of heavy metals and an improved resource management. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved..

AB Oyster shells are a waste product from mariculture that presents a major disposal problem in coastal regions such as southeast Korea. It was found in the present study that pyrolysis of waste oyster shells under defined conditions (750 degreesC for 1 h under a nitrogen atmosphere) transforms this material into a sustainable reagent for efficient (up to 98%) removal of phosphates from wastewater. In comparison, raw oyster shells removed almost no phosphate from water, whereas oyster shells heated to 750 degreesC under an air atmosphere removed a moderate proportion (up to 68%) of phosphates from water. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of pyrolyzed oyster shells showed peaks that were characteristic of calcium oxide, whereas analysis of raw oyster shells showed peaks that were characteristic of calcium carbonate. Surface morphology of pyrolyzed oyster shells also differed from that of raw oyster shells. Preliminary economic feasibility analysis indicates that cost of activated oyster shell is competitive with other wastewater treatment chemicals. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID MALOCCLUSION; PREVALENCE; CHILDREN
AB Objective To determine the prevalence and severity of occlusal problems in populations at the ages of deciduous and permanent dentition and to carry out a meta-analysis to estimate the weighted odds ratio for occlusal problems comparing both groups.
   Methods Data of a probabilistic sample (n=985) of schoolchildren aged 5 and 12 from an epidemiological study in the municipality of Sao Paulo, Brazil, were analyzed using univariate logistic regression (MLR). Results of cross-sectional study data published in the last 70 years were examined in the meta-analysis.
   Results The prevalence of occlusal problems increased from 49.0% (95% Cl =47.4%-50.6%) in the deciduous dentition to 71.3% (95% Cl =70.3%-72.3%) in the permanent dentition (p<0.001). Dentition was the only variable significantly associated to the severity of malocclusion (OR=1.87; 95% Cl =1.43-2.45; p<0.001). The variables sex, type of school and ethnic group were not significant. The meta-analysis showed that a weighted OR of 1.95 (1.91; 1.98) when compared the second dentition period with deciduous and mixed dentition.
   Conclusions In planning oral health services, some activities are indicated to reduce the proportion of moderate/severe malocclusion to levels that are socially more acceptable and economically sustainable.

TI Synergies between veterinarians and para-professionals in the public and
   private sectors: organisational and institutional relationships that
   facilitate the process of privatising animal health services in
   developing countries
SO REVUE SCIENTIFIQUE ET TECHNIQUE-OFFICE INTERNATIONAL DES EPIZOOTIES

DE delivery system; developing country; legislation; veterinary service
AB The delivery of veterinary services in most developing countries was, until recently, considered to be the responsibility of the public sector. However, over the past four decades, economic constraints and the imposition of structural adjustment policies (SAPs) have led to a gradual decline in public sector investment in real terms and thus a reduction in the quality and quantity of services available to livestock keepers. Many governments acknowledged that they were no longer able to provide services that were essentially of a 'private good' nature and introduced radical policy changes which sought to introduce the concepts of a market orientated approach towards agriculture and livestock production in particular. The role of government, in the future, would be to provide a reduced range of essential 'public good' services and to create a favourable environment in which the private sector could become established as a provider of 'private good' services and at the same time act as a partner in carrying out certain public functions under contract or 'sanitary mandates'.
   In almost all developing countries, however, these policy changes were not accompanied by appropriate development strategies. The reasons for this are complex. Firstly, SAPs may be considered to have been foisted upon governments by donors and are thus perceived by many policy-makers as the cause of financial problems, rather than a solution to them. Secondly, most animal health senior policy-makers in the public sector have been trained as veterinarians and lack the required management skills to plan change effectively. Furthermore, as regards clinical veterinary service delivery, especially in rural or more remote areas, the solution fostered by donor investment, which involves deregulation and the deployment of privately operating para-professionals, is often perceived as a threat to the veterinary profession and might result in limiting access to international markets for the trade of livestock and livestock products. An informal delivery system has gained a foothold in many developing countries in the absence of a well-planned strategy for the privatisation of animal health services. Most governments would now acknowledge that this presents a greater risk than the deployment of well-regulated and effectively supervised para-professionals.
   This paper explores some of the principal challenges facing policy-makers in their efforts to bridge the transition from full state provision of animal health services to the formation of a partnership with the private sector. Governments and donors need to take active steps to facilitate the process of privatisation of animal health services, especially those targeting the poorer rural subsistence and pastoralist farming systems. This would entail an initial investment in developing the necessary management skills at all levels in the delivery system. Thereafter, further investment would be required to allow the changes to be managed using tools such as the strategic planning cycle.
   Should sufficient resources be made available to allow the full participation of all stakeholders in the delivery of animal health services, appropriate institutions and effective organisational relationships addressing all the more important issues will have to be identified.
   The paper then proceeds to describe how different livestock production systems determine the level of demand for animal health services. If these services are to be provided on a financially sustainable basis, they must be tailored to meet actual rather than perceived demand. Identifying an appropriate model for animal health service delivery thus requires careful analysis of the production system to be targeted. Governments and donors can play a useful role in providing resources for this type of study as well as for appropriate market studies, business planning, training and access to soft loans.
   Finally, as regards regulation, as the law stands today, many activities currently practised by para-professionals are classified as 'acts of veterinary medicine or surgery' and may only legally be performed by qualified and registered veterinarians. The concept of 'principal' and 'subsidiary' legislation provides the necessary flexibility in the regulation of the delivery of animal health services to accommodate the rapid changes taking place in this environment today.
   Deregulation involves the delegation of responsibility for the performance of a defined range of veterinary interventions to para-professionals under the 'supervision' or 'direction' of a registered veterinarian. The author illustrates how the experiences of a number of projects in Tanzania were used to propose a definition of 'supervision' in law. The definition offers an opportunity to overcome the fear of compromising standards of delivery of animal health services through the deployment of para-professionals. In addition, such functioning provides employment opportunities for private veterinarians in rural areas where access to formal primary animal health services would otherwise be denied and may contribute to the process of quality assurance of national veterinary services in developing countries.

ID LUSITANIAN BASIN
AB The Mesozoic Portuguese geological heritage is very rich and varied, a legacy of the position in the western margin of Iberia and its relationship with its evolution of the North Atlantic, with an interesting tectonic history since the Late Triassic. Regarding the Upper Jurassic several connections can be established between the tectonics and the stratigraphic record in the area surrounding the Caldas da Rainha structure: the basement and salt pillow control on deposition; the beginning of a diapiric and maginatic cycle associated to the onset of sea-floor; the exhumation of both Jurassic deposits and the core of their controlling diapers. The nature of the outcrops and richness in sedimentary environments, related with the different phases of rifting, is a remarkable case for extensional basin studies.
   Geological sites can be of regional, national or international importance due to scientific, educational, economical, social or historical reasons. The present proposal can be considered as a model for the establishment of tourist/educational routes with a strong component in communication on Earth Sciences, integrating social and historical aspects at a regional level. The recognition of those sites as geoheritage may contribute to a Morc sustainable management, in particular because it allows the achievement of a critical dimension for the investment in human resources and marketing. In Portugal, recent legal evolution can be considered promising;. Nevertheless, since implementation of the concept of protected sit depends on the approval of detailed management programs, there are frequent delays, misinterpretations and disrespect for legislation. The strategy to be adopted in project with economic and social interest must integrate conservation aspects, scientific studies and science com nunication.

AB Stakeholders' objectives regarding regional forest policy were evaluated for the area covered by four northernmost Forestry Centres in Finland. The data were collected through a postal questionnaire with 431 respondents, and the judges were asked to assess the importance of the objectives of the regional forest policy on a ratio scale. The data were analysed applying statistical techniques developed for preference elicitation in forestry-related decision making. The results showed that the stakeholder group is the most important characteristic describing the objectives of regional forest policy. Regional characteristics in the form of different Forestry Centres had only a minor impact on assessments. Among other things, the analysis indicates that the objectives in utilizing forests more effectively without increasing cuttings are supported throughout the stakeholder groups. A comparison of the results with the corresponding Regional Forest Programmes indicates that some stakeholders have objectives that are not implemented properly. Further research is needed to find out whether this is a problem from the viewpoint of sustainable forest management.

AB The design and economic realities associated with Personal Computers (PCs) was used as a model for implementing ethical issues into the core-engineering curriculum. Historically, products have not been designed to be recycled easily. By incorporating environmental ethics into our classrooms and industries, valuable materials can be recovered and harmful materials can be eliminated from our waste stream. Future engineers must consider the economic cost-benefit analysis of designing a product for easy material recovery and recycling versus the true cost of the disposal and continued use of virgin materials. A three hour unit on the economic and environmental impacts of product design is proposed for inclusion in the ABET accredited engineering program.

AB Many aspects of design require engineers to make choices based on non-quantifiable personal perspectives. These decisions touch issues in aesthetics, ethics, social impact, and responsibility and sustainability. Part of Baylor University's mission is to provide a learning community in which Christian life values and worldviews might be integrated into academic disciplines. In view of this institutional commitment, members of the Engineering faculty are investigating how Christian worldviews might interact with elements of engineering design in such a way as to produce uniquely Christian insights and inform the non-quantifiable aspects of the engineering process.

SO SMPTE MOTION IMAGING JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB Numerous businesses are based on controlling and vending copies of information, also known as content. Copyright law gives owners many legal rights over these copies(1). Throughout history, owners of content have benefited from cost barriers and degradation to copying and subsequently distributing such copies. In the digital age, however, these costs can become trivial, and degradation non-existent. While copyright laws remain, some fear the business of vending copies is in trouble, and today there are efforts to engineer technology to rebuild and strengthen technical barriers to content duplication. These technological barriers then manage consumers' rights to use the content. Though this is expected to keep the business of vending copies sustainable, it puts tremendous pressure on the technology expected to govern the business. These content-protecting technologies are generally called digital rights management (DRM).

AB Texas is a top water-consuming state in the United States and is increasingly relying on groundwater. Groundwater markets are attracting greater attention as a mechanism for transferring water from rural to urban areas. However, excessive extraction is being exacerbated by the "rule-of-capture'' that governs the use of groundwater in Texas combined with widespread subdivision of land. Overexploitation of common-pool resources is not inevitable. A cooperative approach to groundwater management could reduce the negative economic impacts of water transfers in the area of origin and provide landowner incentives to regulate extraction. Landowner associations, monitored by local groundwater conservation districts, offer an instructive model for sustainably managing groundwater while at the same reallocating water resources from rural to municipal uses.

AB Developments in the agricultural industry are requiring dramatic changes in the role of the farmer away from intensive production oriented approaches towards more sustainable forms of agriculture. While this may appear to require a relatively simply change in emphasis, production based roles not only contain economic value, but contain social value in that they are used to communicate status as a 'good farmer'. Thus, when farmers are asked to change approaches to agriculture, they are not only incurring economic costs but also social costs and this is rarely, if at all, acknowledged. This study uses a symbolic interactionist framework to investigate the symbolic meaning of intensive agricultural production: how crops/livestock are perceived by farmers, how they convey status, and how they are linked with the status of the farm family within the farming community. It concludes that understanding the true meaning of agricultural activities on the farm and considering these factors in the development of policy may reduce the potential loss of established farm families from the land and the subsequent loss of decades or even centuries of experience, knowledge and local history.

AB In the middle terrace area of south Sumatra, Indonesia, where red acid soils poor in crop productivity are widely distributed, the effects of cropping pattern and cultivation techniques on physico-chemical properties of soil were investigated. Five patterns for cassava cropping, including monoculture, a rotation with annual food crops, and three intercroppings with differences in the combination with annual crops and in the planting density, were evaluated in Experiment I. In Experiment II, eight plots composed of the combinations of two tillage methods (no-tillage or conventional tillage), the presence or absence of surface mulch from crop residues, and two rates of chemical fertilizers were established for a maize-soybean-cowpea sequential cropping pattern. At the end of 3 years, there was no difference in total C and total N concentrations among the plots in Experiment I irrespective of the mulch treatment using crop residues. Soil organic matter (SOM) concentration was not affected even in the no-tillage plot where the maximum crop residues (20 t ha(-1)) was given as surface mulch with the increased root residues due to higher rates of fertilizers (Experiment II). In Experiment I, available P concentration was highest in an intercropping with higher fertilizer rates and lowest cassava planting density. In Experiment II, an increase in available P was attained by mulching and the higher rate of fertilizers, and a minor positive effect of fertilizer was also observed in exchangeable Mg and K concentrations. Surface mulch resulted in less clay fraction compared with the non-mulch plots in both the experiments, suggesting its effect on the maintenance of soil particle distribution. An additional finding suggested no prominent influence of cassava monoculture on the level of SOM in this area based on the comparison with other major land uses, including secondary forest, rubber plantation, and mixed cultivation of fruits with crops. Nevertheless, the introduction of crop residue mulch and higher rates of fertilizers are recommended for sustaining soil quality and achieving higher crop yields. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

DT Article
DE multimodal; community; viability; sustainability; normative; evaluation
AB This paper introduces an evaluation method for community projects based on the multimodal systems approach. The method differs from the common mechanistic approach to evaluation in four ways. Firstly, it uses the long-term life (viability) of a community as the ultimate criteria of evaluation. Secondly, it is normative; that is, it focuses on the responsibility of people to their own community and for managing their own lives. Thirdly, it is dynamic; it identifies factors that threaten a community and examines their dynamic link and long-term impact on the community. Fourthly, it evaluates the adequacy of a community activity (good practice) to help ensure its long-term viability. The method is illustrated with a European Union sponsored project.

DT Article
DE Internet; public access; sustainability; digital divide; rural Australia
AB In recent years the Australian government has dedicated considerable project funds to establish public Internet access points in rural and regional communities. Drawing on data from a major Australian study of the social and economic impact of new technologies on rural areas, this paper explores some of the difficulties rural communities have faced in setting up public access points and sustaining them beyond their project funding. Of particular concern is the way that economic sustainability has been positioned as a measure of the success of such ventures. Government funding has been allocated on the basis of these rural public access points becoming economically self-sustaining. This is problematic on a number of counts. It is therefore argued that these public access points should be reconceptualised as essential community infrastructure like schools and libraries, rather than potential economic enterprises.

TI Global-local Amazon politics - Conflicting paradigms in the rainforest

SO THEORY CULTURE & SOCIETY
LA English
DT Article
DE Amazon rainforest; forest policy; transnational NGOs
AB The Amazon rainforest is one of the most important topics of transnational activism. Based on the assumption that the consumption of timber in the Northern hemisphere is largely responsible for deforestation, campaigners have focused on the global timber trade. From a strategy of boycotting tropical timber in the 1980s, environmentalists shifted their approach to one influenced by a discourse on 'sustainable development' in the 1990s. Believing that they could persuade loggers to use less predatory practices, the mainstream NGOs developed a certification scheme in association with timber companies known as the FSC - Forest Stewardship Council. Since then, the NGOs have gained influence over international policies. The focus on the so-called 'Amazon forestry vocation', however, may lead to doubtful results when sustainability of local societies and ecosystems is considered. This article discusses some dimensions of the new Amazon policies that are driven by a global market perspective and which may consequently render local and diverse cultures invisible.

AB This paper argues that it is necessary to define and implement the concept of carrying capacity as a critical aspect for facilitating planning in the tourism process. In order to achieve this aim, this article shows how the growth of Bournemouth may exceed the environmental and ecological carrying capacity of Hengistbury Head, using the case study approach. The paper, therefore, studies the concept of carrying capacity alternatives to this model and includes a set of proposed solutions for determining, managing, controlling and increasing the environmental carrying capacity of a tourist destination.

AB This paper presents the engineering scheme of geothermal water wells development in the porous geothermal system in Kaifeng Area, Henan Province, China. The studied area is a 300 - 1 600 m deep, low temperature (25 - 65 degreesC) geothermal System. Presently, 53 geothermal wells with depths ranging from 440 to 1 580 m are distributed in the geothermal field, which is divided into six sub heat-reservoirs (SHRs). Uniformly improved wells distribution engineering technique scheme was used to remedy the field well distribution, which lacks scientific arguments, and affects the output and sustainability of the geothermal water resource in the region. Under the designed exploitation scheme, the thermal water output (43 224. 40 m(3)/d) from 49 efficient actual field wells can be increased to 150 744. 0 m(3)/d from 110 wells. During the simulated geothermal water exploitation period (30 years) water temperatures barely change in the heat reservoir.

AB Potato is the world's largest non-cereal crop. Potato late blight is a pandemic, foliar wasting potato disease caused by Phytophthora infestans, which has become highly virulent, fungicide resistant, and widely disseminated. Similarly, fungicide resistant isolates of Phytophthora erythroseptica, which causes pink rot, have also become an economic scourge of potato tubers. Thus, an alternate, cost effective strategy for disease control has become an international imperative. Here we describe a strategy for engineering potato plants exhibiting strong protection against these exceptionally virulent pathogens without deleterious effects on plant yield or vigor. The small, naturally occurring antimicrobial cationic peptide, temporin A, was N-terminally modified (MsrA3) and expressed in potato plants. MsrA3 conveyed strong resistance to late blight and pink rot phytopathogens in addition to the bacterial pathogen Erwinia carotovora. Transgenic tubers remained disease-free during storage for more than 2 years. These results provide a timely, sustainable, effective, and environmentally friendly means of control of potato diseases while simultaneously preventing storage losses.

AB Recently, paddy farmers in Sri Lanka have experienced diminished production and profit. Improving profitability through increased efficiency in resource usage is a way to maintain paddy farming's long-term sustainability as an important source of economic livelihood for rural households. Therefore, the objective of this research was to evaluate the technical efficiency of small-scale rice farms in Sri Lanka using the stochastic production frontier methodology and to identify factors which contribute to improved efficiency. Factors such as farm size, inorganic fertilizer, and method of planting showed significant effect on paddy yield. The overall mean technical efficiency of paddy farms was 0.74 (ranging from 0.34 to 0.95). Farmer's age, education, experience, and extension assistance received were the major factors influencing technical inefficiency. Factors such as education and extension assistance were identified as mechanisms to improve the technical efficiency of paddy farms thereby increasing revenues from farming.

AB We report on the community perception of helminth infection and readiness to participate in and pay for a community-based anti-helminth programme in rural Nepal. For data collection, 28 focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted in 28 communities. The FGD results revealed that community members were lacking in scientific knowledge about helminth infection. They also had an unusual perception about it - they believed that a 'mul juka' (vital worm) should reside in every person's stomach from birth, and must never be killed. Nonetheless, the results showed that the community members were willing to participate in and were ready to contribute their resources to the anti-helminth programmes as long as modern medicine would not kill the 'mul juka'. Such community readiness provides us with hope for developing a sustainable anti-helminth programme at the community level through effective health education.

ID POLICY
AB This paper evaluates the use of indicators as a means of measuring the performance of regeneration against sustainability criteria. The merits of sustainability indicators are explored with a discussion of the indicator selection process and the derivation of a points scoring framework. The extent to which the sustainability performance of regeneration projects can be evaluated and subsequently benchmarked is examined. Conclusions are drawn on the robustness of the indicators selected, the versatility of the points scoring framework in capturing the sustainability performance of regeneration projects and the potential to identify 'best' practice. The application of the model and associated indicators is the subject of the subsequent paper in this journal issue.

   performance: Part 2, empirical evaluation and case-study analysis
SO URBAN STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper examines the sustainability of current urban regeneration practice, through the application of weighted indicators and a points scoring framework. The analysis applies the hierarchical model discussed in the preceding paper of this journal issue to case studies of waterfront areas and cultural quarters in three European cities: Belfast, Dublin and Barcelona. The evaluation permits performance comparisons to be made between the case studies regarding the sustainability of regeneration areas and projects, variations on an indicator set basis and the sensitivity of scores. Conclusions are drawn concerning regeneration practice, the extent to which sustainability principles are adhered to, potential policy benefits and the applicability of the model.

SO URBAN STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
ID GOVERNANCE
AB The paper seeks to engage with the interrelationships between the newly established Greater London Authority (GLA) as a form of devolved but diffuse city governance and new procedures for encouraging active public engagement in policy-making processes. The scope and conduct of new discursive spaces for engaging Londoners in the early stages of policy-making concerned with sustainable development are the focus of enquiry. The paper draws on published sources and a series of in-depth interviews conducted with officers, advisers and elected members of the GLA. Theories and practices of deliberative democracy provide the basis for assessing to what extent these experimental discursive spaces supported the pursuit of a collaborative approach to decision-making.

AB Decisions about sustainable development demand spatially differentiated evaluations. As an example, we demonstrate the evaluation of water management strategies in the cities of Berlin and Potsdam (Germany) with respect to their ecological effects in 14 sections of the surface water system. Two decision support systems were compared, namely PROMETHEE, which is designed to obtain a clear decision (linear ranking), and Hasse Diagram Technique (HDT), normally providing more than one favourable solution (partial order). By PROMETHEE, the spatial differentiation had unwanted effects on the result, negating the stakeholders determined weighting of indicators. Therefore, the stakeholder can barely benefit from the convenience of obtaining a clear decision (linear ranking). In contrast, the result obtained by HDT was not influenced by spatial differentiation. Furthermore, HDT provided helpful tools to analyse the evaluation result, such as the concept of antagonistic indicators to discover conflicts in the evaluation process. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Germination experiments were conducted in petri dishes to test the effect of vetiver oil and one of its minor components, nootkatone, on six common weed species. Vetiver oil inhibited germination of redroot pigweed, common lambsquarters, giant ragweed, pitted morningglory, and velvetleaf. Nootkatone, at much higher concentrations than it occurs in the oil, exhibited germination inhibition for all weed species except velvetleaf. Redroot pigweed was the most sensitive species with germination inhibition at 0.1 to 1.0 mg/ml of vetiver oil and nootkatone. At 1.0 to 8.0 mg/ml, nootkatone reduced germination of giant ragweed by 24 to 92%, whereas vetiver oil reduced the germination only by 6 to 11%. Vetiver oil and nootkatone also inhibited seedling expansion of redroot pigweed and common lambsquarters. No significant inhibition of germination and seedling expansion was found for sicklepod. These laboratory studies provide preliminary evidence that nootkatone and vetiver oil may have use as herbicides.

ID UNDERSTORY VEGETATION; FORESTS
AB Large-scale commercial harvest of beargrass (Xerophyllum tenax) has been taking place in the Cascades of Washington and Oregon,for the past 15 to 20 years. The long, slender leaves are either used fresh or dried and dyed for use in the floral industries in the United States and Europe. Our objectives were to develop a better understanding of beargrass production under different tree canopy (overstory) densities in the Pacific silver fir/big huckleberry/beargrass and the mountain hemlock/big huckleberry/beargrass plant associations in and around the Cispus Adaptive Management Area. We examined differences in beargrass production for different overstory canopy conditions on 10 sites in each association. Results indicated that beargrass quality is not of commercial grade under open canopies (<60% overstory density). For medium and high densities, the interaction between plant association and overstory density was significant for all response variables except harvestable dry mass. Harvestable dry mass of beargrass did not differ between the two associations, but was greater under medium- compared with high-density conditions. For the Pacific silver fir association, the high-overstory-density class had greater basal area of beargrass per site, and plants were larger with longer leaves compared to medium-canopy-density sites. We did not find this relationship for the mountain hemlock association, except for the longest leaf variable. It is unclear why basal area and size of beargrass were more closely related to overstory conditions for the Pacific silver fir association. Evaluation of the sustainability of beargrass as a nontimber forest product will require long-term study of the relationships among environmental variables, beargrass productivity, and beargrass population dynamics.

ID OAK WOODLANDS; MODELS; DIVERSITY
AB Over the past century, fire suppression and prevention have altered disturbance regimes across the Pacific Northwest, resulting in a significant divergence of historical and current conditions in forested habitats. To address this continuing trend in habitat changes and begin restoring historical patterns of disturbance, the Clearwater Basin Elk Habitat Initiative (CEI) proposes relatively extensive management actions in the Clearwater basin of north-central Idaho. We attempted to evaluate potential effects of such management actions on selected wildlife species using extant data sets and suggest ways to improve such projects with respect to a multispecies and adaptive management approach. Although there is increased interest in ecosystem management over large areas, the increased scale of analysis and implementation require a substantial increase in the level of species information beyond what currently exists. We conclude that baseline information required for an effective multispecies land-management policy in the Clearwater basin does not exist for many terrestrial wildlife species. To implement a true multispecies or ecosystem approach, wildlife and land managers should cooperate to increase existing population data and modeling efforts for wildlife species in the basin and develop a sustainable monitoring program to evaluate habitat management changes and their influence on wildlife populations within the context of adaptive management theory. Management actions to restore disturbance patterns should attempt spatial and temporal scales that are biologically relevant to the population ecology of species being affected.

AB Annual survival rates of neck-banded adult geese averaged ((x) over bar +/- SE) 0.707 +/- 0.019 during 1984-86, 0.651 +/- 0.022 during 1987-89 when harvest seasons were restricted, and 0.595 +/- 0.028 during 1990-93 when harvest seasons were liberalized. Annual survival rates for neck-banded adults were lower versus leg-banded adults during 1987-89 and 1990-93 (P less than or equal to 0.05). Mean survival of neck-banded adults during the harvest seasons in 1987-89 was lower than the mean rate in the harvest seasons of 1984-86, primarily due to a low Survival estimate in 1989. Survival averaged 0.918 +/- 0.0129 during the 1987 and 1988 harvest seasons but declined to 0.665 +/- 0.051 during 1989. Restrictions in harvest correlated with a decrease in direct recovery rates and an increase in survival rates of neck-banded adults during the 1987 and 1988 harvest seasons, but not in 1989. Higher recovery rates in 1989-92 suggested that increased harvest mortality contributed to lower survival of adult geese. However, mortality rates during the 1989-92 harvest seasons increased at a greater proportion than increases in direct recovery rates, suggesting that factors other than harvest could have significantly impacted fall mortality rates of adult geese.
   Estimated within-year Probabilities of movement, along with Population size estimates, suggested there was a northern shift in fall distributions of EPP Canada geese and delayed migrations during the late 1980s. Probabilities of southward movement for geese in the northern regions of the Flyway declined significantly during October and November when season lengths and quotas were reduced during 1987-89. While restrictions in harvest in 1987-89 corresponded with delays in fall movements, subsequent increases in harvest pressure in 1990-92 did not promote southward movement of geese in early fall. Geese that survived the harvest season in 1990-92 had lower rates of movement during October and early November than did geese that survived the harvest seasons in 1985-86. The gradual shift in the estimated timing of north-south movement, for birds known to have survived the harvest season, suggests mortality rates were higher for geese that moved south early in the fall in 1990-92. However, the lack of information on reporting rates and crippling loss for Canada geese prevented direct estimation of the proportion of fall mortality attributable to harvest.
   Our study demonstrated that a variety of factors can interact to affect the distribution of Canada geese and complicate approaches to population management. Information from marked geese is a critical tool for monitoring changes in survival and harvest rates of Canada goose populations, especially in light of recent changes in winter distributions and resultant mixing of populations. Data for EPP Canada geese indicated that neck-banded geese had lower survival and higher recovery rates than did leg-banded geese. If harvest was the major source of mortality for EPP geese, our results suggested that actual reporting rates for Canada geese were lower than rates estimated for mallards (Anas platyrhynchos). In contrast, if harvest was not the major Source of mortality for geese, then managers need to consider northarvest mortality rates when determining optimal harvest rates for sustainable populations of Canada geese. In light of recent changes in band inscriptions designed to increase reporting Fates, we recommend that managers limit the use of neck bands and that monitoring programs for Canada geese be designed to minimize potential biases due to colored auxiliary markers and differential reporting rates. We also recommend that band reporting rates be evaluated for goose populations across North America. Information on temporal and spatial differences in reporting rates would improve management efforts for EPP Canada geese by allowing a better understanding of the relative impacts of harvest and nonharvest mortality rates.

AB Can information technology (IT) contribute to broad economic development? Can the benefits of IT reach the poor. through better access to education Or to government services? We examine two ongoing Projects that aim to provide IT-based services to rural populations in India. Several features distinguish these projects front others: a combination of public and private efforts, and goals of commercial sustainability. We draw lessons from comparing different approaches in similar localities. While the goals of the two organizations studied are similar, we identify some important differences in implementation that may have more general implications For the Success of such projects.

AB As of 1 May 2004 the EU will extend and include ten additional member states, a considerable challenge for the community, and one can only hope that the integration of these new countries occurs without major upheaval. For the sugarbeet sector this represents an increase in the sugarbeet area of about 30%, with a 15% increase in sugar production. The main contributor to the increased sugar production will be Poland, with approximately 2 million tonnes out of the 3 million additional tonnes of sugar. These ten new member states will come under European sugar market regulations and will expect a secure framework beyond 2006.

AB Production and consumption of meat and fish have serious consequences for global food security and the environment. An understanding of the factors that influence meat and fish consumption is important for developing a sustainable food production and distribution system. For a sample of 132 nations, we use ordinary-least-squares (OLS) regression to assess the effects of modernization and ecological context on per capita meat and fish consumption. We find that ecological conditions in a nation, such as resource availability and climate, influence meat and fish consumption. Additionally, indicators of modernization, particularly economic development, influence the consumption of both meat and fish. However, the effect of economic development on consumption patterns is distinctly different among geographic regions. We conclude that in order to understand national dietary patterns, researchers need to take into account not only ecological context and economic development, but also regional/cultural factors.

AB An ultrashort half-cycle pulse (HCP) is a fast (< 1 ps) unipolar pulse, followed by a much longer (similar to 100 ps) and weaker unipolar pulse of opposite polarity. We show that such pulses can be utilized to localize, within. femtoseconds, and control, for pcoseconds, the electronic motion in a AlxGa1-xAs based symmetric double quantum well. The results are obtained by (i) deriving analytically for a model system the type of HCPs that lead to a fast and sustainable localization of a desirable final electron state and (ii) by solving. numerically exactly the time-dependent Schrodinger equation for the quantum-well structure in the presence of the HCPs.

AB Ever since seawater desalination has been applied on an industrial scale, and particular in the countries of the Arabian Gulf, the application of desalination processes in dual-purpose facilities - water and power - as a hybrid configuration has been discussed in many feasibility investigations and also planning concepts. It is above all the combination of reverse osmosis with thermal processes that has found increasing interest with the aim of ensuring, as economically as possible, uniform water supplies under the specific, greatly varying load conditions in the Gulf countries. Such design concepts for hybrid configurations encompass straightforward structures with a low degree of coupling between membrane and thermal desalination processes, but range up to very complex configurations with strong interconnections on both the water side and thermally, as well as with several desalination processes connected in series or in parallel. Classical hybrid concepts in which the permeate from an RO desalination component is mixed with distillate from thermal desalination have already been implemented in Saudi Arabian dual-purpose plants, like Jeddah and Yanbu-Medina. Although hybrid systems of greater complexity have been addressed in many design studies and publications, up to now none has been brought to fruition. Coming into consideration asthe design basis for determining the capacity shares of the various desalination processes operated in a hybrid configuration are: arrangement of thermal cycle of the power plant component; water/power ratio of the dual-purpose seawater desalination and power plant; provision of undiminished water production of the desalination plant as electricity generation varies; provision of a specified drinking water quality with regard to composition and salt content; combination of all these aspects. Also gaining in importance are concerns of environmental pollution and sustainable development when selecting seawater desalination and power plant configurations, as well as their optimization when considering desalination and electricity generation as a whole. In the practical design of hybrid membrane and thermal systems, aspects come to light, though, that restrict linking of the two systems and joint utilization of facilities, as conceived in studies and conceptual design investigations. This applies both for common utilization of intakes and the use of heated up cooling water from thermal processes as a feed stream for the RO part of the desalination process. Additionally, requirements of drinking water composition, particularly chloride content TDS and compliance with a specified residual content of boron, influence specifically the design of the membrane process part and its share in the total desalination capacity. Such practical aspects have greatly influenced thedesign and configuration of the Fujairah hybrid plant for which, from a total desalination capacity of 100 MIGD.

AB The harvesting of non-timber forest products has been proposed as an alternative to timber harvesting that can increase rural income while having a reduced impact on forest structure. However, surprisingly little is known about the biological consequences of harvesting these products. We conducted a 3-year experiment in which we simulated the stem harvesting of the Amazonian plant Ischnosiphon polyphyllus, which is used by traditional and indigenous populations in the Amazon for the construction of baskets, mats, and other handicrafts used in manioc cultivation. We found that plant mortality is limited in all except the most extreme harvesting treatments. However, we also found that plants recuperate extremely slowly from experimental harvesting. These results suggest that current harvesting strategies may not be conservative enough to ensure long-term population survival. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We assessed the relationship of the regeneration (seedling and sapling) densities of seven representative tall-tree species to the past partial cutting and current stand structure. We also determined if differences in tree regeneration were associated to establishment substrates (coarse woody debris (CWD) and root throws) and understory inhibitor vegetation (the dwarf bamboo species: Sasa senanensis). The study was conducted in 17 conifer-hardwood mixed stands in a heavy snowfall region in Hokkaido, northern Japan. The results suggest that stand structure, rather than logging intensity, is the primary factor influencing regeneration densities. Total conifer basal area was positively correlated with the regeneration density of individual tree species, including two conifers and three hardwoods. These patterns differ from those observed in old-growth stands in the region. A negative correlation between total conifer basal area and dwarf bamboo coverage suggests that the presence of dense conifer canopies causes an increase in regeneration density of tall-tree species by preventing domination of dwarf bamboo. Picea glehnii, a species that depends for its establishment strongly on CWD, has lower seedling and sapling density in stands with higher logging intensity. This seems to be a result of the decrease in the volume of CWD with increasing logging intensity in these stands. We suggest that both reducing logging intensity and retaining overstory conifers should be considered to develop a sustainable silvicultural system in this region. Providing sufficient CWD and root throws may also be important to ensure natural regeneration of tree species that require these as an establishment substrate. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

TI Pure and mixed forest plantations with native species of the dry tropics
   of Costa Rica: a comparison of growth and productivity
SO FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
LA English

DE Costa Rica; native species; mixed plantations
ID RESTORATION
AB In Costa Rica, most reforestation trials with native species were established in the tropical humid regions. In the dry tropics, research on the performance of native species in forest plantations is incipient and trials comparing pure and mixed designs are limited. This paper presents the results of two experimental plantations with native trees in pure and mixed plots in the dry tropics of Costa Rica. The growth and productivity of 13 native species in pure and mixed plantations was compared with Tectona grandis (L.f.) Lam., an exotic species broadly used in the region. In a plantation of relatively slower growing species, measurements taken at 68 months of age resulted in Samanea saman (Jacq.) Merril. and Dalbergia retusa Hemsl. demonstrating the best growth, followed by Astronium graveolens Jacq. and Swietenia macrophylla King. Measurements in a plantation of relatively faster growing species, at 68 months of age, showed that growth of Schizolobium parahyba (Vell.) Blake was greatest in the pure and mixed plots, followed by Terminalia oblonga (Ruiz & Pav.) Steud., Anarcadium excelsum (Bert. & Balb. ex Kunth) Skeels and Pseudosamanea guachapele (Kunth) Harms. The native species grew better in the mixed plots. The pure plots of T grandis (L.f.) Lam. were the most productive, compared to all species and the mixture of species. Plantations of T grandis (L.f.) Lam. seem to be well adapted to the region and are certainly a commercially interesting alternative. Nevertheless, mixed plantations with native species would contribute more to sustainable management, because while single-species plantations do not provide a great range of goods and services when compared to the natural forest, mixed plantations are likely to increase this range of benefits.

AB In order to improve high-resolution forecasts, a specific method for assimilating rainfall rates into the Regional Atmospheric Modelling System model has been developed. It is based on the inversion of the Kuo convective parameterisation scheme. A nudging technique is applied to 'gently' increase with time the weight of the estimated precipitation in the assimilation process. A rough but manageable technique is explained to estimate the partition of convective precipitation from stratiform one, without requiring any ancillary measurement. The method is general purpose, but it is tuned for geostationary satellite rainfall estimation assimilation. Preliminary results are presented and discussed, both through totally simulated experiments and through experiments assimilating real satellite-based precipitation observations. For every case study, Rainfall data are computed with a rapid update satellite precipitation estimation algorithm based on IR and MW satellite observations. This research was carried out in the framework of the EURAINSAT project (an EC research project co-funded by the Energy, Environment and Sustainable Development Programme within the topic 'Development of generic Earth observation technologies', Contract number EVGI-2000-00030).

AB The main aim of the present study is to evaluate the effects of long-term irrigation with water at three different levels of salinity on Barnea olive trees with a view to optimize vegetative growth, productivity and oil quality. The study was carried out on trees growing in the Negev desert of Israel. The intermediate salinity (4.2 dS m(-1) EC) inhibited growth significantly only in the first year after planting, while from the second year onward retardation of vegetative growth as compared with the control treatment (1.2 dS m(-1) EC) was slight and non-significant. However, the high salinity (7.5 dS m(-1) EC) retarded tree growth significantly. Furthermore, the intermediate treatment led to significant increase in tree productivity relative to the other treatments, and also to an increase in olive oil yield. In conformity with the greater number of fruits produced, the olives of the 4.2 dS m(-1) EC treatment tended to be smaller.
   No significant differences were found between saline- and control-water irrigated trees in terms of olive oil basic quality parameters, such as free fatty acids, peroxide value, and fatty acid profile. The saline treatments increased the levels of certain antioxidant components (polyphenols and Vitamin E) in the oil extracted from the olives as compared with the control. The data obtained clearly show that, of the three water salinities tried, the moderate level of 4.2 dS m(-1) EC is best suited for production of olives and olive oil under the conditions prevailing in the central Negev, at least during the first 9 years from planting. The sustainability of Barnea cultivation under moderately saline water is discussed. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents a study undertaken to evaluate site suitability for sewage effluent renovation based on physico-chemical characteristics of the soil. The results obtained showed that as the soil becomes acidic, the phosphorus concentration in the soil reduces accordingly. The chloride ion concentration was found to be a reliable indicator for evaluating the soil capacity to remove nitrogen. A high cation exchange capacity (CEC) can enhance the renovation of sewage effluent. Soils with high quartz content had a low CEC with high organic matter content (OM) being able to compensate. Therefore, an understanding of the micro-nutrients in the soil, organic matter content and chloride ion concentration are important.
   To facilitate a multi-variate approach for site selection, multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) methods, PROMETHEE and GAIA, were applied for analysis of a sequence of three matrices consisting of 8, 16, and 48 soil site objects, respectively, and seven soil property parameters. Matrix models and the interpretation of results are discussed in detail. From these analyses, PROMETHEE II net outranking flows, phi, found that two sites were always among the top three ranks of the three matrix models, which suggested that they were the most suitable for sewage effluent renovation. The criteria CEC and OM, were particularly important for the selection of these better sites, but pH and Cl- attributes discriminated the weaker performing sites from the better ones; as well the PO43- and the NH3-N criteria were in general opposition to CEC, OM, pH and Cl- but were much less effective as discriminators. Consideration of net outranking flows suggested an approach method for the selection of other possibly suitable sites for sewage effluent renovation. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The West Asia and North Africa (WANA) region, with a Mediterranean climate type, has an increasing deficit in cereal production, especially bread wheat. Rainfed cropping in the highlands of this region coincides with the severely cold winter with mostly, snow from November to April. Cereal yields, are low and variable mainly as a result of inadequate and erratic seasonal rainfall and associated management factors, such as late sowing (or late crop emergence). In an area where water is limited, small amounts of supplemental irrigation (SI) water can make up for the deficits in seasonal rain and produce satisfactory and sustainable yields. This field study (1999-2002) on a deep clay silty soil in north west of Iran was conducted with four SI levels (rainfed, 1/3, 2/3 and full irrigation requirements) combined with different N rates (0, 30, 60, 90 and 120 kg ha(-1)) with one wheat variety (Sabalan). Yields of rainfed wheat varied with seasonal rainfall and its distribution. A delay in the crop emergence from October (SI treatment) to November (rainfed) consistently reduced yields. With irrigation, crop responses to nitrogen were generally significant up to 60 kg N ha(-1). An addition of only limited irrigation (1/3 of full irrigation) significantly increased yields and maximized water use efficiency (WUE). Use efficiency for water and N was greatly increased by SI. Under deficit irrigation, maximum WUE would be achieved when 60 kg N ha(-1) is combined with 1/3 of full SI. Early crop germination is essential to ensure adequate crop stand before the winter frost and to achieve high yield. Early emergence can be achieved by applying a small amount (40-50 mm) of SI after sowing. Thus, when limited SI is combined with appropriate management, wheat production can be substantially and consistently increased in this highland semi-arid zone. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

TI Threshold for sustainable exploitation of an age-structured fishery

   distribution; fisheries management
AB Assuming a discrete rate of variation of the total number of individuals equaling to zero in the long-term, as a population responds to exploitation with constant age-specific survival probabilities, it can be proved that a stable age structure exists. Such a stable structure does not depend on the recruitment process but on the survival probability from one age to another. It is not necessary to make any assumption on the recruit-reproductive biomass relationship or on depensation or compensation. The age structure is "filled" with the recruitment process and with the survival of individuals from one age to another. Besides assuming that the contribution of each age to determine future recruitment stabilizes through time, it can be proved that recruitment stabilizes and that a strong convergence of the vector of each population state to a stable state exists. All these results are general for population dynamics.
   The impact of exploitation varies according to ages and modifies the probabilities of survival. A threshold to separate sustainable from non-sustainable survival probabilities under exploitation can be established. This threshold depends only on biological-reproductive parameters. In fisheries stock assessment the age-specific survival probabilities show a functional relationship with age-specific fishing mortality rates. The combination of closed areas and selectivity of the fishing gear permit to put a limit to age-specific fishing mortality rates. Such regulations, and other complementary measures combined in a consistent manner allow to establish sustainable recovery and exploitation plans. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Planning for sustainable land management and the development of land classification systems has become a very complex process with the increasing sophistication of GIS techniques. This has resulted in the emphasis moving to detailed micro-scale description and planning, with a loss of perception of the physical processes and hierarchy of constraints that control local activities. We have developed a meso-scale climate-landscape classification technique which would enable policy makers to develop simplified guidelines for rural activities and to help landholders identify appropriate sustainable land uses. It would also provide a simplified tool for assessment of the effectiveness of a protected areas network. We propose that unless the basic physical possibilities and limitations of the environment are properly understood it is not possible to have sustainable land management, nor stay within the carrying capacity of the local environment.

AB This study deals with the preparation and properties of a new class of organic-inorganic hybrids from renewable resources. The hybrids were synthesized by an acid-catalyzed curing of epoxidized triglycerides in the presence of an organophilic montmorillonite (a modified clay). The mechanical properties were improved by the incorporation of clay in the oil-based polymer matrix. The reinforcement effect due to the addition of clay was confirmed by dynamic viscoelasticity analysis. The hybrids showed relatively high thermal stability. The co-curing of epoxidized soybean and linseed oils in the presence of clay produced hybrids with controlled mechanical and coating properties. The barrier property of the hybrid towards water vapor was superior to that of the oil polymer. The development of the present hybrids consisting of inexpensive renewable resources, triglyceride and clay is expected to contribute to global sustainability.

AB Few studies have monitored change in professional practice over time to determine the sustainability of change. Research from other behavioural change literature shows that initial change is difficult to maintain, with reported relapse rates as high as 80%.
   Interventions most likely to succeed are based on a clear understanding of target behaviours and the environmental context. Facilitators and barriers are usually multifaceted and occur at a number of interrelated levels.
   The issue targeted for intervention must be clearly defined at the outset, so that antecedents, determinants and supporting mechanisms can be defined, suggesting points for intervention and strategies for initial and sustainable change.
   The target population's readiness to change is an important factor at both an individual and organisational level.

AB An antimony-germanium-(Sb-Ge-) codoped fiber specially designed for the fabrication of fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs) with high temperature sustainability has been developed. The photosensitivity and the high-temperature sustainability of FBGs that have been written into this fiber were tested. The results obtained showed that the FBG written into this fiber has a very high temperature sustainability of 900degreesC. A decay mechanism that involves cation hopping is presented to explain the observed high temperature sustainability of the grating written into this fiber. (C) 2004 Optical Society of America.

TI Sustainable trophy hunting of African lions

ID COOPERATION; INFANTICIDE; MAMMALS; KINSHIP
AB In most species, sport hunting of male trophy animals can only reduce overall population size when the rate of removal of males is so high that females can no longer be impregnated(1). However, where males provide extensive paternal care, the removal of even a few individuals could harm the population as a whole(2,3). In species such as lions, excessive trophy hunting could theoretically cause male replacements (and associated infanticide(4,5)) to become sufficiently common to prevent cubs reaching adulthood. Here we simulate the population consequences of lion trophy hunting using a spatially explicit, individual-based, stochastic model parameterized with 40 years of demographic data from northern Tanzania. Although our simulations confirm that infanticide increases the risk of population extinction, trophy hunting could be sustained simply by hunting males above a minimum age threshold, and this strategy maximizes both the quantity and the quality of the long-term kill. We present a simple non-invasive technique for estimating lion age in populations lacking long-term records, and suggest that quotas would be unnecessary in any male-only trophy species where age determination could be reliably implemented.

AB Hydraulic lift is a movement of water between soil layers contrasting in water potential through plant root systems. We expected that an introduction of deep-rooted plants into intercropping systems could provide an opportunity for the associated crops to utilize water from deep in the soil layers through hydraulic lift. A stable hydrogen isotope (deuterium) was used to investigate this possibility in a field experiment conducted at the Zambia National Irrigation Research Station. Maize (Zea mays) plants were grown adjacent to the deep rooting legumes, pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan) and sesbania (Sesbania sesban), whose roots accessed groundwater having the deuterium/hydrogen isotope ratios (deltaD) different from those of rainfall. We hypothesized that the deltaD values of xylem waters from shallow-rooted maize would become closer to those of groundwater when hydraulic lift occurred, and this would be affected by the distance between the maize and the legumes. The maize near pigeon pea showed deltaD values closer to those of groundwater while the maize at a distance did not. However, we could not detect such a distance-dependence in maize plants grown adjacent to sesbania. Based on the field trial, a glasshouse experiment was implemented for the pigeon pea-maize association. The plants were grown in a split-root container with an air gap between the two soil layers. The pigeon pea roots were allowed to develop in the bottom soil injected with D2O while the maize roots were confined in the top soil. Immediately after the injection, a higher D concentration above the level of natural occurrence was detected in xylem waters from each of the maize plants, confirming that pigeon pea lifted water from the bottom and transferred it to the maize. Moreover, the water supply from the pigeon pea to the maize was enhanced by the shading treatment on the pigeon pea, implying the possibility of regulating the function of the hydraulic lift. It is concluded that at least pigeon pea can supply water from deeper soil layers to the associating maize plants through hydraulic lift, and that such a sprinkler-like function (pumping up and transferring water to surrounding plants) may be regulated by agricultural practices that suppress transpiration rate.

AB The Long-Term Research on Agricultural Systems (LTRAS) experiment has been monitoring the long-term effects of conventional and alternative practices on crop yields and soil properties since 1993, with a planned duration of 100 years. Data for the first 9 years are presented here. Ten, 2-year rotations, each with three 0.4 ha plots per phase of the rotation, range from low-input tainted unfertilized wheat to high-input irrigated conventional and organic maize-tomato systems. For years 3-9, average yields of alternative (organic and green manure) systems were significantly lower than those of comparable conventional systems, except that there were no significant differences in average yields of tomato. Delayed seeding after a winter legume cover crop (LCC) limited maize yields. Yield trends over years were somewhat obscured by variability due to weather. Negative yield trends over years in unfertilized wheat controls were statistically significant, but only when data for the 9th year were included. Yield trends for organic maize were also significantly negative, but tomato yields in the same system showed a significant positive trend, as did yields of conventional maize. As this experiment continues, long-term trends in soil properties and processes could alter the magnitude or direction of trends seen to date. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents the analysis of sectoral energy and exergy utilization of Saudi Arabia by considering the energy and exergy flows for the 12 years between 1990 and 2001. Sectoral energy and exergy efficiencies are obtained for the subsectors and the devices used in each sector. Energy and exergy flow diagrams for Saudi Arabia are also presented, respectively, to illustrate the situation on how energy and exergy efficiencies vary in each sector. The residential sector appears to be the most energy efficient sector, and the industrial sector to be the most exergy efficient. It is believed that the current methodology is useful for analyzing sectoral energy and exergy utilization, which will help Saudi Arabia with energy savings through energy efficiency and/or energy conservation measures. It is also be helpful to establish standards to facilitate application in various sectors and processes for a sustainable energy planning. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB Selected and non-selected stocks of the Kuruma shrimp Penaeus (Marsupenaeus) japonicus (Bate, 1888) were reared from postlarvae to harvest size in commercial ponds and their growth rates compared. The three stocks examined were: progeny of wild broodstock (G(1)); progeny of first generation domesticated broodstock (G(2)) mass-selected for maximum size at harvest and conditioned for 5 months in controlled environment tanks, and; progeny of high-growth broodstock (H(4)) originally selected at G(1) for maximum size at harvest from a commercial pond and subsequently reared in controlled condition tanks for three generations. During the experiment, variations in physical conditions in the ponds fluctuated but appeared to be within the range tolerated by P japonicus. The results demonstrated significant gains in the weight at first harvest for the selected stocks. Compared to the progeny of wild stocks, there was a 9.3% increase in the mean weight at first harvest of G(2) stocks and a 14% increase in the H(4) stocks. The ability of the H(4) tank reared stocks to retain their capacity for superior growth in farm ponds has significant implications for selective breeding of this species. Sub-sets of specific pathogen free (SPF) lines of selected stocks, maintained in biosecure conditions, could provide a valuable and sustainable genetic resource for stocking farms or reestablishing farm populations in the event of stock losses due to disease outbreaks or other factors.

AB To construct macro- and microarray tools suitable for expression profiling in root endosymbioses of the model legume Medicago truncatula, we PCR-amplified a total of 6048 cDNA probes representing genes expressed in uninfected roots, mycorrhizal roots and young root nodules [Nucleic Acids Res. 30 (2002) 5579]. Including additional probes for either tissue-specific or constitutively expressed control genes, 5651 successfully amplified gene-specific probes were used to grid macro- and to spot microarrays designated Mt6k-RIT (M. truncatula 6k root interaction transcriptome). Subsequent to a technical validation of microarray printing, we performed two pilot expression profiling experiments using Cy-labeled targets from Sinorhizobium meliloti-induced root nodules and Glomus intraradices-colonized arbuscular mycorrhizal roots. These targets detected marker genes for nodule and arbuscular mycorrhiza development, amongst them different nodule-specific leghemoglobin and nodulin genes as well as a mycorrhiza-specific phosphate transporter gene. In addition, we identified several dozens of genes that have so far not been reported to be differentially expressed in nodules or arbuscular mycorrhiza thus demonstrating that Mt6k-RIT arrays serve as useful tools for an identification of genes relevant for legume root endosymbioses. A comprehensive profiling of such candidate genes will be very helpful to the development of breeding strategies and for the improvement of cultivation management targeted at increasing legume use in sustainable agricultural systems.

AB Context Suicide rates are highest in late life; the majority of older adults who die by suicide have seen a primary care physician in preceding months. Depression is the strongest risk factor for late-life suicide and for suicide's precursor, suicidal ideation.
   Objective To determine the effect of a primary care intervention on suicidal ideation and depression in older patients.
   Design and Setting Randomized controlled trial known as PROSPECT (Prevention of Suicide in Primary Care Elderly: Collaborative Trial) with patient recruitment from 20 primary care practices in New York City, Philadelphia, and Pittsburgh regions, May 1999 through August 2001.
   Participants Two-stage, age-stratified (60-74, greater than or equal to75 years) depression screening of randomly sampled patients; enrollment included patients who screened positive and a random sample of screened negative patients. This analysis included patients with a depression diagnosis (N=598).
   Intervention Treatment guidelines tailored for the elderly with care management compared with usual care.
   Main Outcome Measures Assessment of suicidal ideation and depression severity at baseline, 4 months, 8 months, and 12 months.
   Results Rates of suicidal ideation declined faster (P=.01) in intervention patients compared with usual care patients; at 4 months, in the intervention group, raw rates of suicidal ideation declined 12.9% points (29.4% to 16.5%) compared with 3.0% points (20.1% to 17.1% in usual care [P=.01]). Among patients reporting suicidal ideation, resolution of ideation was faster among intervention patients (P=.03); differences peaked at 8 months (70.7% vs 43.9% resolution; P=.005). Intervention patients had a more favorable course of depression in both degree and speed of symptom reduction; group difference peaked at 4 months. The effects on depression were not significant among,, patients with minor depression unless suicidal ideation was present.
   Conclusions Evidence of the intervention's effectiveness in community-based primary care with a heterogeneous sample of depressed patients introduces new challenges related to its sustainability and dissemination. The intervention's effectiveness in reducing suicidal ideation, regardless of depression severity, reinforces its role as a prevention strategy to reduce risk factors for suicide in late life.

AB Adakite is associated closely with the epithermal and porphyry An, Cu and Ag deposits, and most of large porphyry copper deposits in the Circurn-Pacific Belt are related to adakite. The key factor to form the deposits in the adakite is the dehydration from amphibole to garnet during the formation of adakite, which exacts the metal elements enriched in the mantle and mafic rocks into the adakite. The localities of adakite are therefore usually related to the Cu and An mineralization. China is a country short in copper resource. To find large and superlarge porphyry copper deposits are probably a sustainable way to solve the shortage. The majority of the world-scale copper deposits occur in the Cireum-Pacific Belt, whereas similar deposits in China occur not in the eastern China, but in the Paleo-Asian Oceanic Belt, the eastern part of NE China and Gandise Mountain of Tibet. It is suggested here that the further exploration be aimed at the epithermal and porphyry An, Cu and Ag deposits in the Paleozoic Paleo-Asian Oceanic orogenic belt, Late Paleozoic-Mesozoic the eastern part of NE China and Mesozoic-Cenozoic Gandise Mt. of Tibet, in particular in the southwestem margin of Altun-eastern Zungar, eastern Tianshan and middle Inner Mongolia areas of the Paleo-Asian Oecanic orogenic belt. Since adakite is like an indicator of these kinds of ore deposits, the exploration strategy should be processed to find adakite first, then the deposits.

AB We have developed a novel reaction protocol for the highly efficient and sustainable catalysis of the silane alcoholysis reaction. The catalysts of choice are dirhodium(II) perfluorocarboxylates bearing long perfluoroalkyl chains, which are easily prepared in one step from commercial precursors. Under optimized reaction conditions, these catalysts exhibit up to about 50 times higher activity and 100 times higher productivity than analogous dirhodium(II) complexes described in the prior art. Furthermore, the reaction can be run in a completely solventless fashion. Finally, heterogenization of these catalysts has been accomplished through a novel strategy based on fluorous chemistry. Indeed, perfluorinated catalysts of this kind are easily adsorbed on silica which has been previously functionalized at its surface with perfluoroalkyl chains. Use of such supported catalysts (bonded fluorous phase catalysts) allows an easy and almost complete catalyst separation and recycling with improved catalytic performance.

AB The sustainability of conventional agriculture in Bangladesh is under threat from the continuous degradation of land and water resources, and from declining yields due to indiscriminate use of agro-chemicals. An NGO is pursuing efforts to promote ecological agriculture with emphasis on better use of on-farm resources and the reduction of external inputs. This paper examines the sustainability of two production systems in terms of their environmental soundness, economic viability and social acceptability based on empirical data collected through a household survey, soil sample analysis, observations and discussions with key informants. Twelve indicators were selected to evaluate sustainability. Significant differences were found between the two systems in crop diversification, soil fertility management, pests and diseases management, and use of agro-chemicals. However, no significant variations were found in other indicators such as land-use pattern, crop yield and stability, risk and uncertainties, and food security. Although crop yield and financial return were found to be slightly higher in the conventional system, the economic return and value addition per unit of land did not show any difference. The findings suggest that ecological agriculture has a tendency towards becoming ecologically, economically and socially more sound than conventional agriculture, as it requires considerably less agro-chemicals, adds more organic matter to the soil, provides balanced food, and requires higher local inputs without markedly compromising output and financial benefits. Broad-policy measures, including the creation of mass awareness of adverse health effects of agrochemical-based products, are outlined for the promotion of ecological agriculture.

AB Many mechanisms now exist for consumers to express progressive values in purchasing decisions. Although demand for such goods has grown, these goods remain the purview of small niche markets. Focusing on the market for agricultural goods (and the choice between the paradigms of industrialized versus sustainable agriculture), this paper discusses three major reasons (market failures, entry barriers, and biased policies) why it is difficult for consumers to express their values for a more sustainable system in this way, and why policy change is needed to create a fairer playing field. The current policy, voluntary labeling, is inadequate. A new set of policies, including taxes and subsidies to correct market failures, is needed to create opportunities for consumers to support values such as health, community, and stewardship.

   owned fields in southwest British Columbia

ID ENVIRONMENT; IMPACT; CHINA
AB According to literature, insecure land tenure biases against soil conservation on farmland. However, there is little evidence to test whether farmers need to own their land to conserve it, or if long-term leases are adequate. One way to infer whether or not different land tenure arrangements promote long-term management is through analyzing the types of crops planted on fields with different land tenure arrangements. Perennials, forage legumes, grasslands, and grain are all important parts of sustainable crop rotation in southwest British Columbia but provide little cash return in the year they are planted. Annual crops provide a high cash return but create soil conservation problems if they are planted too often. A comparison of fields with different land tenures showed that farmers who own their land plant more perennials, grain, and forage legumes than farmers who rent fields. Few differences were observed on fields with different lease lengths. This study leads to three overall conclusions. First, although results confirm the literature, and insecure land tenure is a real obstacle to long-term soil conservation, it is not possible to assume that long-term leases will substitute for land ownership. Second, it is possible to use relatively easy-to-gather data on crop history to assess the impact of tenure on farming. Third, intervening variables, in this case a program that pays farmers to plant grasslands, over-rides the effect of insecure land tenure and creates incentives for owner-operators and tenant farmers alike to use crop management that protects soil fertility in the long term.

AB The intrinsic dynamics and innovative potential of the rural poor in China can be illustrated by the phenomena of farmer innovation circles (FIC) in north Shaanxi. These are informal networks used by farmers to collaborate on technology learning and agricultural production. Though not limited to specific geographic locations, these circles are particularly important in the marginal areas of rural China where the complexity of the geographic environment, the diversity of farmer demands, and the inefficiency of formal agricultural extension networks impede the spread of new agricultural technologies. Social connectedness in the form of household communication networks, technology learning groups, and inter-village links aids people's collective capacity to work together. In the study of 50 villages in this remote region, it was found that households with more connections were more likely to adopt a range of new technologies (ploughs, varieties, inputs, orchards, afforestation, grazing land rehabilitation), and so had higher income. A detailed case study shows how collective action can lead to environmental improvements that further increase incomes. It is concluded that if there is to be sustainable development in the marginal areas of China, then there will clearly need to be closer communication and interaction between agricultural professionals and rural communities.

AB Irrigation (or 'floating') of watermeadows in Europe was economically important before the 20th century because it enhanced grazing sward productivity in the spring. Today, few operational systems remain, but interest in floating as a technique is returning as concern grows over floodplain management, the fate of nutrients and the sustainability of agricultural production systems. Investigations into grass productivity, phosphorus and nitrogen relations were undertaken at a surviving watermeadow system, the Britford Site of Special Scientific Interest, Salisbury, England (1995-2001) and at an experimental site at Norwich, England (1998-2001). Irrigation significantly increased late-winter and early-spring grass productivity at Britford in the order of 60-80% over 5 weeks compared with un-irrigated controls. Phosphorus travelled across the system; some included with the clay fraction in suspended sediment, but available phosphorus in the topsoil reduced across the meadows by between one-half and one-third. Nitrate in irrigation water was utilised, but the meadow system did not reduce concentrations of dissolved nitrate. Increased nitrate concentration in soil-water is attributed to mineralisation after drainage. Annual nitrogen cycle process modelling suggests the present levels of production and soil organic matter accumulation are attributable to environmental eutrophication. A conceptual model is presented for enhanced spring growth following floating and it is concluded that, while temperature is the trigger that enhances productivity early in the season, this is achieved by enhancing the mineralisation of soil organic matter and release of available nitrogen. There was no evidence that watermeadows act as a sink for nitrogen mobile in surface waters but there was significant uptake of topsoil available phosphorus. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

AB Land-use change has important implications for sustainable livelihood of local communities where traditional crop-livestock mixed farming is sustained with local inputs. Knowledge of recent changes in land use, driving forces and implications of changes within the context of sustainable development is limited. This study analyses the changes in spatial patterns of agricultural land use, crop diversity, manure input, yield, soil loss and run-off from cropland, and dependence of agroecosystems on forests, during the 1963-1993 period in a small watershed in central Himalaya, India. Data obtained from existing maps, interpretation of satellite imagery, geographic information system (GIS) based land-use change analysis, participatory survey and field measurements were integrated to quantify changes at the landscape/watershed scale. During the 1963-1993 period, agricultural land use increased by 30% at the cost of loss of 5% of forestland. About 60% of agricultural expansion occurred in community forests compared to 35% in protected forests and 5% in reserve forests. Agricultural expansion was most conspicuous at higher elevations (1800-2600m) and on medium slopes (10-30degrees). Cultivation of buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum L., Fagopyrum tataricum (L.) Gaertner), hogmillet (Panicum miliaceum L.) and foxtail millet (Setaria italica (L.) Beauv.) was abandoned. Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.), a cash crop, completely replaced the abandoned crops and partially replaced many other traditional crops. Soil loss, run-off and manure input related to potato cultivation was much higher compared to other crops. Mean annual fodder yield from cropland declined by 44%, while manure input, soil loss and run-off increased by 46, 90 and 51%, respectively. Changes in land use and management have improved household income but at the cost of increase in intensity of biomass removal from forests and loss of forest cover. As farm productivity is dependent on forests, continued depletion of forest resources will result in poor economic returns from agriculture to local people together with loss of global benefits from forest biodiversity and ecosystem services. Policy support for sustainable income from forests to local people as well as technologies enhancing agricultural productivity through conservation of traditional crop diversity and efficient resource recycling within agroecosystems is needed for sustainable livelihood of local communities together with global benefits from the Himalayan forests and ecosystem services.

TI Biomass production of banana plants in the indigenous farming system of
   the East African Highland - A case study on the Kamachumu Plateau in
   northwest Tanzania

AB The Haya people in northwest Tanzania have thrived by practising a unique farming system in which banana (Musa acuminata and M. balbisiana) is a staple food. Recent population pressure and long-term shortage of manure, however, have caused disputes about the decline in banana. production. In this study, to begin to solve the issue, the biomass of banana plants grown in Haya fields on the Kamachumu Plateau was estimated by using a non-destructive method. Twelve quadrats of 100 or 225 m(2) were established. Pseudostem height and diameter of all banana plants in each quadrat were measured, and the pseudostem volume was calculated. The fresh weight (FW) and dry weight (DW) of each plant in the quadrats were calculated from the relationship between the pseudostem. volume and FW and DW of various organs in 14 sampled plants. The total DW of banana plants in each unit field area varied greatly among quadrats (from 0. 12 to 1.45 kg m(-2)), but it averaged 0.92 +/- 0.08.kg m(-2) on a farm scale, which was reasonably homogeneous despite the differences in farm size of each household and fertility management. The annual production of banana bunches was estimated at 3.4 kg m(-2) from the average bunch FW and the annual bunch-bearing proportion: it was much higher than in the surrounding areas. Nevertheless, owing to a small proportion of edible part in a banana bunch, the current system would provide a net dry matter yield (pulp) of 0.38 kg m(-2) a year. This yield is comparable to a reasonably good yield (grains) of cereal crops in the tropics. However, the banana yield for each unit time should be at least halved because the plants need I year to produce the yield. ne turnover rate of total dry matter was 0.7-0.9 a year, showing a dynamic exchange of photosynthates and nutrients in permanent banana fields. Further study is needed to strengthen the sustainability of the current farming system from wider perspectives, including the nutrient balance and socio-economic aspect. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

TI Mechanisms and responses of a single dielectric barrier plasma actuator:
   Geometric effects
SO AIAA JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID ATMOSPHERIC-PRESSURE; SILENT DISCHARGE; GLOW-DISCHARGE; SIMULATION
AB The single dielectric barrier discharge plasma, a plasma sustainable at atmospheric pressure, has shown considerable promise as a flow control device operating at modest (tens of watts) power levels. Measurements are presented of the development of the plasma during the course of the discharge cycle, and the relevance of these measurements to the modeling of the actuator's electrical properties is discussed. Experimental evidence is presented strongly pointing to the electric field enhancement near the leading edge of the actuator as a dominant factor determining the effectiveness of momentum coupling into the surrounding air. It is shown that the thrust produced by the actuator depends directly on the thickness of the exposed electrode even when the bulk discharge properties of the plasma remain unchanged. The case for field enhancement is bolstered by the application of an analytical model in closed form that, although an abstraction of the real actuator geometry, indicates that electric forces on charge imbalance in the plasma are concentrated predominantly near the edge of the exposed electrode. Both of these results are consistent with computational fluid dynamics calculations of the actuator in operation.

TI A comparative physics study of alternative long-term strategies for
   closure of the nuclear fuel cycle
SO ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY
LA English
DT Article
AB The appropriate management of radioactive waste arising from the nuclear fuel cycle is considered to be a key issue in the development of future, more sustainable nuclear energy systems. In this context, the partitioning and transmutation of actinides could play an important role through the achievement of very significant reductions in the actinide content and radiotoxicity of the high-level waste requiring geological disposal.
   The current paper reports on the results of a detailed physics study carried out to compare the pros and cons of alternative strategies for closure of the nuclear fuel cycle. Different long-term "steady-state" scenarios have been considered, involving the deployment, to varying degrees, of light water reactors (LWRs) and advanced fast-spectrum systems. The same nuclear data and calculation methods have been used throughout, so that a consistent and reliable comparison of the relative performance of the three basic fuel cycle options (once-through, plutonium recycle, and recycling of all actinides) has been made possible. In addition, with transmutation having been considered employing both critical and accelerator-driven fast-spectrum systems, the study has provided an evaluation of the advantages and disadvantages of these two different advanced system types.

ID CIVIL-SOCIETY; FREE-TRADE; ENVIRONMENT; WORLD
AB This article explores the relationship between hope and agency in the contexts of migrant rights activism and alternative trading relationships created through social and environmental certification systems. Using interviews with key respondents from nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), hope is assigned a positive role in the complex process of social change, providing that common goals can be agreed upon and achieved along the way. Two main layers of analysis emerge in this article. The first explores the relationship between hope and agency, with a particular focus on power, both enabling and coercive. Powerful groups can hijack hope, but also hope can be used to mobilize various marginalized groups to find a collective voice, eventually leading to empowerment. The power relations among groups determine how competing collective hopes play out in action. A second layer to the relationship between hope and action is the way in which hope effects social change. Through conceptualizing hope within the context of the change process, we address the relationship between hope, agency, and time. An important ingredient linking hope, agency, and time in a sustainable manner is the notion of empowerment.

AB Brazilian pine (Araucaria angustifolia, Araucariaceae) is one of the few native gymnosperms from southern Brazil. In Rio Grande do Sul, it occurs mainly in the highlands of the planalto region, as a tree-component of the mixed ombrophyllous forests. The species is valuable for its wood, edible seeds, and ornamental use, and is today listed as a threatened species. This tree-species establishes associations with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, and assessing the impact of such association to the species-performance will help us in defining the management procedures for its use in conservation and sustainable purposes. In this study, we tested the nutritional and growth responses of seedlings to inoculation with Glomus clarum, a fungal species identified in the rhizosphere of Brazilian pine in natural stands. A greenhouse study was conducted, where plants were either inoculated with G. clarum or with a sterilized version of the same inoculum. Plant growth was evaluated over a 2 I-month period by measuring the total shoot length, and, at the end, by plant dry mass, leaf nutrient content, and root colonization. Seedlings inoculated with G. clarum had a high degree of mycorrhizal colonization of their roots (81%). The inoculated seedlings grew significantly more (312% mass increase) than the controls, which had a higher root:shoot ratio than the inoculated seedlings. Leaf concentrations of P, K, Na, and Cu were higher while those of Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn, and B were lower in the inoculated plants. The results indicate a strong response of A. angustifolia to mycorrhizas, suggesting a high degree of dependence of the species on these associations. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB It is important for the sustainable development of economy to exploit new energy. The utilization of low-grade heat source is confined for its lower utilizing efficiency. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) at 110 K has plenty of physical cold exergy besides its high quality chemical energy. A power cycle with natural gas directly expanding based on the cold energy of LNG and a low-grade heat source has been established in this paper. Some parameters of the cycle have been investigated. The results indicate that the temperature of low-grade heat source, the condensing temperature of second medium, and the inlet pressure of the turbine are the key factors affecting the thermal and exergy efficiencies of the power cycle. The thermal and exergy efficiencies will be improved with the increasing of the temperature of the low-grade heat source, the decreasing of the condensing temperature and the increasing of the inlet pressure of the turbine. The thermal efficiency and exergy efficiency of the power cycle will be above 30% and 40%, respectively, after optimizing the key parameters. In order to further improve the utilizing efficiency of low-grade heat source, a regenerative power cycle has been put forward and analyzed. The results show that under the same conditions the thermal and exergy efficiency of the power cycle increase 3-5%. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Most existing in-lake methods used to minimize the remobilization of redox-sensitive compounds from sediments are costly and limited in their effectiveness. Therefore, new approaches for this problem are needed. We describe electrochemically initiated transformation processes of iron and manganese, resulting in their immobilization in the sediment. This process could possibly be applied to prevent remobilization of phosphate from lake sediments. With electrodes positioned 3 cm in the sediment and 7 cm above the sediment-water interface, an electrochemically controlled redox- and pH-"barrier" was constructed. By means of laboratory experiments in columns filled with sediment and water from a reservoir, we demonstrated the possibility to fix and concentrate Fe and Mn under specific conditions in the sediment, or if required, to mobilize and drain them in concentrated solution. The behaviors of these metals were studied by simultaneous measurements of their concentrations, pH-, E-h-values, and O-2-concentration at the interface and in the water with and without current influence. The results show that soluble species can be transported and concentrated in an electric field. Iron and manganese can be prevented from being released from the sediments by sustainable in-situ fixation.

DT Article
AB The global nutrition community recognizes the usefulness of nuclear and isotopic techniques and especially stable isotopes for accurate measurements in key areas of human nutrition and health. Although progress has been made in many Latin America countries in reducing the absolute number of undernourished people, food policy and public health communities have to face the double burden on health. On one side they have to address the prevention of obesity and on the other side they are trying to reduce undernutrition. However, to be successful in development of sustainable nutrition programs, a combination of relevant scientific knowledge and approaches that are practical is required to assure even a reasonable level of success. The objectives of this review are to highlight the role of isotopic techniques in nutritional studies and to review the role of the International Atomic Energy Agency in supporting nutrition interventions in Latin America countries.

AB This article argues that policy discourses need to be set within the heterogeneous resources that governments routinely use to govern across the state/non-state divide. It employs the governmentality perspective to show how a discursive coalition in the planning for housing sector uses such resources to embed a new rationality of 'planning for sustainability' in a host of differing local arenas. The article extends the governmentality approach by proposing that this 'embedding' process is geographically uneven as the discourse becomes enmeshed in differing economic and environmental circumstances. The analysis thus reveals a geography of governmentality by showing how local actions intrude upon the functioning of governmental networks.

AB This paper presents a robust gain-scheduled approach for the control of a vertical/short takeoff. and landing (V/STOL) aircraft. The nonlinear aircraft dynamics exhibit non-minimum phase characteristics arising from the parasitic coupling effect between the aircraft's lateral force and rolling moment. The undesired coupling effect also causes modelling uncertainy of the aircraft dynamics. The nonlinear aircraft dynamics are considered to be composed of a nominal linear parameter varying (LPV) system and a linear system with a norm bounded uncertainy matrix multiplied by the parasitic uncertain non-minimum phase coupling parameter. The nominal LPV system is considered to be affinely dependent on a measurable varying parameter. The ranges of the varying parameter and its variation as well as its parasitic induced uncertain matrix are addressed by introducing the parameter-dependent invariant ellipsoid interpretation for dealing with the issue of affinely quadratic stabilization. In this paper, the relations among the magnitude of actuator saturation, the maximum achievable relative stability, and the sustainable coupling uncertainty are investigated for the considered robust gain-scheduled design.

ID BIG 6 MERGERS; AUSTRALIAN MARKET; FEES; PRICES; SIZE
AB Porter's (1985) analysis of competitive strategy is used to explain industry specialization by Big 6 accounting firms. In Porter's framework, industry specialization can be viewed as a differentiation strategy whose purpose is to create a sustainable competitive advantage relative to nonspecialist auditors. A differentiation strategy will lead to higher audit fees if valued by clients. We find evidence of higher fees for Big 6 industry specialists relative to nonspecialists in the U.S. audit market, but only for companies in the lower halt of the sample based on size (assets < $123 million). By contrast, companies in the upper half of the sample do not pay a specialist premium, and audit fees actually decrease as a company becomes increasingly large relative to its auditor's industry clientele. Together these results suggest that audit fees are higher when clients are small and have little bargaining power, but audit fees are lower when clients have greater bargaining power and this is more likely when companies are large in absolute size and large relative to their auditor's industry clientele.

DE legal structures; coastal land use; planning; environmentally
   sustainable development; New South Wales
AB This paper examines how legal structures interact with land-use decisions in the coastal zone. The emphasis is on NSW where there has been a steady evolution of legislative and other measures to regulate how the coast is to be planned and managed. These measures arise from a long history of individual, corporate, local government and State agency actions directed more at private benefit than at protecting and conserving environmental values for the public good. Alienation of foreshores, restrictions on access, buildings located in hazardous areas, canals exposing soils rich in acids, and pollution of waterways are examples of degradation on this coast. Yet much remains to be protected. Expansion of coastal national parks over the past decade has helped. But new planning controls have been introduced to support the NSW Coastal Policy (1997). In essence, there is evidence that the State government seeks to implement environmentally sustainable development principles to ensure that as the population continues to grow, decisions on future land uses will reflect the functioning of ecosystems and the dynamics of coastal and catchment geomorphology and hydrology. Pressures from individuals and corporations exercising traditional property rights need to be managed within a statutory framework that facilitates sustainability of coastal environmental values cherished by so many.

TI Economic impacts of the CAP-Reform 2003 on dairyfarms in Austria
SO BERICHTE UBER LANDWIRTSCHAFT
LA German
DT Article
AB On June 26(th), 2003 EU farm ministers adopted a fundamental reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). The key elements of the CAP-Reform were the introduction of a single payment scheme for EU farmers (decoupling), a reduction of direct payments (modulation) and a corresponding increase in the budget for rural development policies, and the linkage of payments to compliance with environmental, food safety and animal welfare standards (cross-compliance). The present study is an analysis of the possible impacts of the new farm policy on dairy enterprises in Austria; it examines the economics of different szenarios of farm adjustment under the new conditions. Linear programming was used to determine the gross margins before und after CAP-Reform for five dairy farms modeled in this study. These model farms represent the most common farm sizes and production systems in Austria. Without major adaptations, the model came up with slightly reduced gross margins for all five farms after CAP-Reform, mainly due to the reduction in the price of milk. Also farm growth becomes less economical. Some changes in farm business management lead to a compensation of most of the losses of income due to CAP-Reform. The new system of direct payments implemented with CAP-Reform provides new opportunities for farm development. In order to achieve economic sustainability, farmers must adapt to the new conditions quickly and increasingly focus on market developments, consumer demands and environmental and animal-friendly husbandry.

DE community attitudes; Mongolia; poaching; wildlife utilisation
AB In recent years illegal hunting has increased in Mongolia, putting considerable pressure on large mammals populations. The causes for this phenomenon lie in increasing rural poverty, ineffective policies to regulate hunting, as well as a ready market for many wildlife products in the Chinese medicine markets of east Asia. It is now accepted that biodiversity is ultimately lost or conserved at the local level and it is therefore imperative that the perspectives of the local people are better understood if wildlife management programmes are to be sustainable. This research uses a 'grounded theory' approach to investigate local community attitudes to wildlife utilisation and to explore what local people consider as a sustainable wildlife management strategy in remoter regions of Mongolia. The findings clearly suggest that the current situation is not conducive to sustainability either of wildlife populations or human livelihoods. Important changes are needed if sustainability is to be achieved, including alterations to property rights, greater government support, and improved marketing skills and employment opportunities from wildlife. Linked to all of the above points is the need to address the serious information deficit experienced in rural Mongolia to enable local people to examine critically the issues at hand and to participate actively in solutions.

AB Since the 1800s, brocket deer have been an important source of meat and income for subsistence and professional hunters in the Peruvian Amazon. Today, local people continue to hunt brocket deer for subsistence meat and for sale in local meat markets. Although brocket deer are not hunted as frequently as peccaries, they make a significant contribution to rural household economies. This study assessed the sustainability of hunting of brocket deer by local communities in the Tamshiyacu Tahuayo Communal Reserve (TTCR), northeastern Peru. We analyzed data from 1991 to 1999 using density comparisons, hunting pressures, an age structure model, and a harvest model comparing results between heavily hunted, slightly hunted, and non-hunted sites. The four approaches agreed that brocket deer are harvested sustainably. The sustainability of brocket deer hunting will depend on the continued presence of other valuable wildlife species (e.g. peccaries and large rodents), which are more preferred due to their ease of hunting and higher rates of encounters. Gross productivity indicates that brocket deer are showing resilience in the form of density dependent reproductive adjustments in the TTCR, but they may still be vulnerable to overhunting. Consequently, current levels of harvesting may be continued until further ecological and biological information on the species' population trends assist in defining more reliable sustainable offtake levels.

AB This article investigates the sources of value creation in the exchange relationships between internationalizing Canadian small high-technology firms and their various stakeholders. The paper reviews the concepts of exchange and value, and applies these concepts to small internationalizing high-technology businesses. The data are based on semi-structured interviews with 20 Canadian high-technology small and medium-sized enterprises (HTSMEs). The analysis shows that HTSMEs strive to attain internal and external efficiency. Efficiency, however, is a subset of Personalization, which consists of developing close relationships with dedicated partners in order to create sustainable value. This study demonstrates that value creation for HTSMEs is not only a matter of creating products at the cutting edge, but primarily of managing a constellation of relationships within evolving networks.

AB We evaluated the temporal dynamics of herbage biomass and protein within riparian meadows and upland grasslands of native Aspen Parkland rangeland to understand the contribution of each to livestock foraging. For the growing season monitored, meadows were greater in forage yield and crude protein (P < 0.05), leading to important implications for sustainable livestock production and rangeland conservation.

DE green biorefinery; biomass; grassland; silage; proteins; lactic acids;
   grass fibres; sustainability
AB A Green Biorefinery is a concept to utilize green (grassland) biomass as raw material for the production of biobased products like proteins, lactic acids, fibres and energy (via biogas). The exploitation of grassland might have intriguing side effects like the conservation of cultural landscapes and the improvement of the "stay option" of farmers. Since 1999 comprehensive research starting from the raw material up to product formulation and development is carried out in Austria. However, in contrast to the centralized Biorefinery concepts in Europe, the Austrian Green Biorefinery focuses on a decentralized system based on grass-silage. Silage is rich in lactic acid and storage is organized decentralized. During the last years different green biomass and silage were analyzed. As a next step fractionation was carried out and trials for product separation took place. This work led to an integrated system elaboration of the Biorefinery concept. For economic assessment mass and energy balances were taken as the basis and a biogas plant has been considered as benchmark.(5,9,12) However, due to permanent adoption of the economic models only current trends of economic assessment are summarized in this paper. With lactic acid and amino acids (proteins) as key products from silage the results support the assumption that Biorefineries can be viable and sustainable development efforts in rural regions are supported in Austria. This paper provides a condensed overview on research results of the last four years.

SO CHINA QUARTERLY
LA English
DT Article
ID STATE
AB This article questions the effectiveness and viability of the fiscal response to rural stability adopted by the Chinese state. Tax-for-fee reform (feigaishui) has been heralded as a possible solution to the cancer of excessive fiscal predation by local government. While the experiment may have achieved in relief of peasant burden, the success is simply based on central government financial sponsorship and is thus hardly sustainable as a national programme. And unless there is fundamental reform of fiscal redistribution, the new scheme will ironically hurt rather than help the poorest peasants. Putting all the blame on local cadres is politically expedient, but the central government needs to admit that the present crisis is a result of the systemic discrimination against peasants and the consequent deficit in financing rural governance. The ultimate solution entails a full-scale eradication of structural bias against the peasantry.

AB Meeting the challenge of sustainable development requires substantial advances in understanding the interaction of natural and human systems. The dynamics of regional sustainable development could be addressed in the context of complex system thinking. Three features of complex systems are that they are uncertain, non-linear and self-organizing. Modeling regional development requires a consideration of these features. This paper discusses the feasibility of using the artificial neural networt(ANN) to establish an adjustment prediction model for the complex systems of sustainable development (CSSD). Shanghai Municipality was selected as the research area to set up the model, from which reliable prediction data were produced in order to help regional development planning. A new approach, which could help to manage regional sustainable development, is then explored.

TI KARST ENVIRONMENT AND ECO-POVERTY IN SOUTHWESTERN CHINA: A CASE STUDY OF
   GUIZHOU PROVINCE
SO CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
DE karst environment; rock desertification; eco-poverty; Guizhou
AB Guizhou Province is one of the least developed areas with the largest number of counties in poverty and the widest coverage of karst landscape in China. The vulnerability of its karst eco-environment seriously threatens the survival of local residents and the development of local economy. Rapid population growth results in higher demand of various resources, which leads to more intensive development activities. For example, the blindfolded development on steep slopes has caused rock desertification of local rare soil in this karst area. It has induced a vicious circle in the poverty -> population growth -> ecosystem degradation and so on. About 3.13 x 10(6) people belong to the absolute impoverished population in Guizhou Province and most of them are living in rock-desertification areas. The essential reasons for destitution are the atrocious eco-environment and the huge population stress. Degradation of mountain ecosystems in southwestern China has continued at unprecedented speed and scale in recent decades. It is necessary to control population growth strictly and prevent further expansion of rock-desertification in order to develop local economy and better living conditions for local people. The only way to ensure a sustainable, stable and harmonious development of human, nature and economy is to restore a good condition of eco-environment and resolve the conflicts between human and land use.

TI LAND COVER CHANGES AND LANDSCAPE DYNAMICS ASSESSMENT IN LOWER REACHES OF
   TARIM RIVER IN CHINA
SO CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE

DT Article
DE Tarim River; LUCC; landscape evaluation; landscape ecological indices
AB The Tarim River Basin, located in the typical arid region, is one of the key regions of LUCC research in China and plays an important role in maintaining the sustainable development of the western China. In recent years, the ecological environment of the Tarim River Basin has degraded greatly. In the lower reaches, in particular, the riverbed has been dried up for more than 20 years, which accelerated the desertification and has been a great threat to people's lives. Taking the section of the Tarim River between Qiala Lake and Taitema Lake as a typical region, an investigation on land cover changes was carried out with the support of remote sensing information of 1988 and 2000 respectively. The changes of land cover in this region were obtained: 1) Cropland tended to increase. 2) Urban or Built-up Area in 2000 was 324.4ha more than that in 1988.3) Waters expanded by 3476.51ha. 4) Woodland and Grassland decreased, while Barren Land increased by 3824.9ha. The total amount of land use/land cover change between 1988 and 2000 is small, which is only 0.355% of the total area. It shows that the developmental pace of the lower reaches of the Tarim River is relative slow. Based on these results, the authors assessed the landscape dynamics of this region and pointed out that the degree of desertification was strengthened and the landscape dominated by sand land was further characterized by salt desert.

DE the Relativity; sustainable development; existence at minimum
   environment cost; relative development surface
AB From the realism of science, and taking the guide of EINSTEIN's Relativity as guide, this article called in question the present theory of the sustainable development by the rational thinking of philosophy and a close logic inference. It is found that there are many paradoxes to the theory. Through more deepening and meticulous inference, we arrived at philosophic language of science about the sustainable development. The sustainable development is "non-sustainable development", and the non-sustainable development is "the best sustainable development". While carrying out philosophical principle thinking and repeating science demonstration for the sustainable development, this article got further confirmation that the existence of human being at the minimum environment cost may help them obtain motive power of the sustainable development. In fact, this foundation motive power exists in the flow of development in different organization levels, meanwhile it exists in strategy of intuition living of the ancient people. Only in relative lower environment cost to live can we get the support system of science for the sustainable development, and be able really to achieve the basic goal of the sustainable development.

AB Purpose of review Obesity continues to increase in the United States and worldwide. There is controversy surrounding different dietary patterns used to promote weight loss, and none has emerged as clearly more effective. This paper briefly reviews the factors that influence energy intake and dietary treatments used to promote weight loss.
   Recent findings Increasing portion size, eating away from home, and consuming a variety of high-energy dense foods appear to increase energy intake. Hormonal influences on diet continue to be explored. Very-low-calorie diets and low-carbo hydrate diets lead to greater initial weight loss, but long-term results are no better than more moderate calorie-restricted diets. A program using meal replacements appears to lead to weight loss slightly greater than calorie-restricted diets and offers one option to treat obesity. Dietary patterns low in energy density and glycemic index have potential in treating obesity and should be studied further.
   Summary Clearly, a dietary pattern that prescribes a lower total energy intake is necessary for weight loss, and this pattern should be sustainable to maintain weight loss. Although many dietary programs can achieve short-term loss of weight, dietary treatment should be recommended that emphasizes lifestyle changes and is consistent with other dietary guidelines to promote long-term health. Features consistent with this are a dietary pattern low in total calories, saturated fat, and refined carbohydrate; moderate in whole grains; and high in low-energy dense vegetables and fruits. Future studies should explore dietary strategies and combination therapies that contribute to weight loss, long-term weight maintenance, and improved health.

AB Nature offers useful lessons on how fibres with controlled properties can be produced from sustainable starting materials under environmentally friendly conditions. As we begin to learn these lessons, the advantages that they offer have to be weighed against Nature's limitations: the same molecular features that make biomolecular fibres initially processable in water are also reflected in the fibres having water-sensitive properties, which may not be attractive in an engineering material. Particular attention is given to recent findings that the short-term impressive tensile properties of spider dragline silk as recorded in conventional tests performed at constant strain rate are compromised by creep and stress relaxation, especially in humid environments. Some practical steps towards applying Nature's lessons while addressing the constraints of these lessons are suggested. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The genuine savings index (GSI) is a simple indicator that can be used to assess an economy's sustainability. It defines wealth more broadly than orthodox national accounts, and recalculates national savings figures based on this new definition. Genuine savings aim to represent the value of the net change in the whole range of assets that are important for development: produced assets, natural resources, environmental quality, and human resources. This paper takes the broad framework developed in previous studies and tests its application with respect to the United Kingdom and Taiwan between 1970 and 1998, with the goal of assessing the feasibility of using such measures quite broadly as indices of sustainable development. The paper shows that both the United Kingdom and Taiwan have positive genuine savings rates over the period in question, with the United Kingdom registering lower ones than Taiwan.

AB Nine years after the Kobe earthquake in Japan, social issues are still prominent, and the rehabilitation process is still ongoing. The earthquake caused two major changes in Japanese society: an increase in voluntary and non-government activities, and the enhancement of cooperation between local government and the residents' association. People's participation in the decision-making process was a significant achievement. To sustain the efforts generated after the earthquake, the Kobe Action Plan was formulated and tested in different disaster scenarios. The current study suggests that civil societies in urban areas are sustainable if, first, the activities related to daily services are provided by the resident's associations; and second, these are linked to economic incentives. Leadership plays a crucial role in collective decision-making. Creation of the support system is essential for long-term sustainability of civil-society activities. These observations are exemplified in the case study in Nishi Suma, one of the worst-affected areas in the Kobe city.

SO ECOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY
LA English
DT Article
AB The foundations of ecological science were laid down at those times when the problem of a possible loss of local and global environmental sustainability was not as acute as it has become today. To make sure that the proposed scientific solutions to this problem are responsible, it is useful to revise the existing frameworks of environmental thought. In this paper, we present quantitative evidence suggesting that the persistence of an environment suitable for life for any appreciable period of time is only possible as long as a substantial area on the planet's surface is occupied by natural ecosystems undisturbed by anthropogenic activities. Once the natural biotic mechanism of environmental control is destroyed, both local and global environment rapidly (over a time scale of hundreds of years) degrade to a state unfit for life, even if any direct anthropogenic environmental impact like industrial pollution is absent. It is therefore important to quantitatively assess the stabilizing impact of natural ecosystems and to determine the necessary and sufficient global area that must be exempted from anthropogenic activities and let be occupied by natural ecosystems, so that the latter have power enough to sustain the global environment in a stable life-compatible state. This urgent scientific task emerges as the major challenge for modern ecological science. We discuss how the proposed conceptual approach to the biota-environment interaction relates to the important paradigms of biological theory. (c) 2003 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB Criteria and indicators under the Montreal process are intended to provide a common framework for describing and evaluating progress towards sustainable forest management. In 1998 a nationally coordinated project was initiated to evaluate proposed Montreal indicators 4.1.d and 4.1.e and to provide advice to state agencies on how these indicators could be applied. Interim indicator 4.1.e quantifies `Proportion of harvested forest area with significant change in bulk density of any horizon of the surface (0-30 cm) soil'.
   Application and evaluation of this interim indicator was conducted as part of the Warra Silvicultural Systems Trial, in Tasmania, Australia. This forest was composed of wet mixed regrowth/mature Eucalyptus obliqua forest with a dense rainforest understorey.
   Pre-harvest soil sampling was conducted in four stands followed by post-harvest sampling at two of the sites. Pre-harvest sampling according to soil drainage class, showed that there was a high natural variation in bulk density within individual stands and between neighbouring stands.
   Post-harvest sampling was stratified according to major operational areas and disturbance classes, including snig tracks (major and minor), firebreaks, harvested and unharvested areas, landings and access roads. Forest harvesting substantially increased the variability of soil bulk density. Though moderate and severe disturbance of the snig tracks and firebreaks increased average soil bulk density, changes in soil bulk density were not uni-directional. Many of the post-harvest samples showed a marked decline in soil bulk density due to the incorporation of litter and slash in the upper soil layer.
   Bulk density changed most in the upper 0-100 mm layer of soil. Hence there is reasonable argument that monitoring changes in bulk density should be limited to this depth. This would substantially reduce the cost of replicate sampling to the 300 mm depth.
   The high natural variation found for soil bulk density and the fact that changes are not uni-directional means that it is unlikely that the interim indicator proposed can be implemented in a practical, sensitive and cost-effective manner in the forest type examined in this study.

AB In La Paz Bay, two artisanal fisheries operate, one based on hook-and-line, targeting snappers and groupers, and the other mainly based on gillnets, targeting species such as tilefish and haemulids. A shrimp fishery, which is not permitted to expand, also operates. We analyzed various harvesting strategies with the Ecopath with Ecosim modelling software, using catch-and-effort data for target species to fit simulated biomasses. Optimal harvesting strategies for artisanal fisheries were explored using social, economic and ecological criteria. Several harvesting strategies were simulated: continuation of the current state of the fisheries, optimizing economic and social (employment) criteria, using maximum sustainable yield (MSY) as a goal of management, and optimization of an ecological criterion when necessary. Optimization of current fisheries and economic and social criteria, and the MSY resulted in depletion of some stocks and in no-realistic increases in fishing effort. Combinations of economic-ecological, social-ecological and economic-social-ecological criteria did not result in stock depletion. However, some of these scenarios resulted in unrealistic choices, especially large increases in gillnet fishing effort. Among the reasonable choices, a strategy of increasing the hook-and-line fishery effort by a factor of 1.5 and the gillnet effort by a factor of 2.8, appeared to be potentially applicable, to increase efficiency of the artisanal fisheries.

AB Processes controlling the production of new fish (recruitment) are poorly understood and therefore challenge population ecologists and resource managers. Sprat in the Baltic Sea is no exception: recruitment varies widely between years and is virtually independent of the biomass of mature sprat. Sprat is a key prey and predator species in the Baltic ecosystem and is commercially exploited (1.86 X 10(8) kg/yr since 1974). The population and fishery must therefore be managed sustainably and if necessary accommodate environmental effects on population dynamics. We demonstrate using 45 years of data that recruitment depends on temperature conditions during the months when sprat gonads, eggs, and larvae are developing. We also show that recruitment can be predicted before adults spawn (and fully 15 months earlier than using present technology) by using linkages between recruitment, large-scale climate variability (North Atlantic Oscillation), Baltic Sea ice coverage, and water temperature. These relationships increase our understanding of sprat population dynamics and enable a desirable integration of fisheries ecology and management with climatology and oceanography.

AB The depletion of fish stocks from global fisheries has been a long-standing concern. More recently, incidental catch of non-target (termed bycatch) vertebrates also has been proposed as a serious conservation issue. Here we present a bycatch assessment for loggerhead and leatherback sea turtles that are incidentally caught by global pelagic longlines. We integrate catch data from over 40 nations and bycatch data from 13 international observer programmes. Despite infrequent rates of encounter, our analyses show that more than 200 000 loggerheads and 50 000 leatherbacks were likely taken as pelagic longline bycatch in 2000. Our analyses suggest that thousands of these turtles die each year from longline gear in the Pacific Ocean alone. Given 80-95% declines for Pacific loggerhead and leatherback populations over the last 20 years, this bycatch level is not sustainable. Adopting a large-scale, synthetic approach is critical to accurately characterize the influence of global fisheries bycatch on globally distributed and imperilled pelagic vertebrates.

AB We study the long-run sustainability of reputations in games with imperfect public monitoring. It is impossible to maintain a permanent reputation for playing a strategy that does not play an equilibrium of the game without uncertainty about types. Thus, a player cannot indefinitely sustain a reputation for noncredible behavior in the presence of imperfect monitoring.

AB We show that optimal monetary and fiscal policies are time consistent for a class of economies often used in applied work, economies appealing because they are consistent with the growth facts. We establish our results in two steps. We first show that for this class of economies, the Friedman rule of setting nominal interest rates to zero is optimal under commitment. We then show that optimal policies are time consistent if the Friedman rule is optimal. For our benchmark economy in which the time consistency problem is most severe, the converse also holds: if optimal policies. are time consistent, then the Friedman rule is optimal.

DT Article
DE totora; Schoenoplectus californicus; cyperaceae; Peru
ID COAST; ECUADOR
AB In coastal and highland Peru, totora, Schoenoplectus californicus (C. A. Meyer) Sojak (Cyperaceae), has played a central cultural role. Totora was used to build boats, houses, bridges, mats, containers, clothing, string, and fans and has been noted for its use as both food (for humans and livestock) and fertilizer. We conducted unstructured interviews in Spanish and followed participant observation methods in Huanchaco and Lake Titicaca located in coastal and highland Peru, respectively. We hypothesized that a plant with high saliency to the local culture would have a high level of associated indigenous conservation practices. In addition, the level of care and management should increase as the resource became more valued or increasingly scarce. We found that, despite a long established tradition of sustainable use, the people were increasingly relying on intensive cultivation of this plant. The value of totora to local residents justified the efforts spent in maintaining adequate supplies of this plant. Increases in population, politics, and yearly variation in climate patterns have created a reduction in available totora and contributed to an increase in management practices.

AB For the Bribri and the Cabecar Indians of Costa Rica the environment is divided in two: the "near", indigenous space; and the "far", natural space, which they think does not belong to them. In the former, the following agroecosystems can be distinguished according to biodiversity and intensity of human activity: tropical home garden, rotating slash-and-burn agriculture, plantain polyculture, and plantain monoculture. In the "far" space, these two culturally close groups harvest wild plants observing ancestral rules, which have helped ensure a sustainable use of forest resources. Their diet is based on 84 species, of which 24 are harvested in the "far" environment (hombron, semko, platanillo, tacaco, etc.) and 60 are obtained in the "near" environment (maize, bean, cacao, manioc, etc.). Owing to acculturation, exotic species (mainly rice, sugarcane, plantain, cacao and citrus fruit) have become part of their diet and crops.

ID FIBERS
AB Extraction of lechuguilla fiber (Agave lecheguilla) is often the only source of income for some rural inhabitants in and zones of Mexico. A model for biomass estimation of lechuguilla by nondestructive techniques was developed and then applied to evaluate whether traditional harvesting had an effect on (1) biomass production of the bud (part of the plant traditionally collected to obtain fiber) and (2) plant density. Six months after harvesting, biomass production was higher for buds of harvested plants than for buds of unharvested plants, but there were no differences I year after harvesting. Number of new plants was not affected by harvesting. Hence it appears that at least in the short term the common practice for extracting lechuguilla fiber does not affect population density, but significantly increases growth of central buds.

AB The density of neem trees in parts of Malindi District in eastern Kenya was assessed to determine the sustainability of their use in the local woodcarving industry. Size and age structure of neem populations under different ownership were analyzed to establish the Annual Allowable Cut. Neem is an excellent carving wood and the available quantities along the Kenyan coast are sufficient to sustainably supply the industry of the whole country. However, because the resource comes from small farm holdings and the supply system to carving groups is not well established, further efforts are required to introduce a management regime that could be certified under the standards of the Forest Stewardship Council.

ID GROWTH
AB Following Arrow et al. (2003), this paper considers green national accounting when population is changing and instantaneous well-being depends both on per capita consumption and population size. Welfare improvement is shown to be indicated by an expanded 'genuine savings indicator', taking into account the value of population growth, or by an expanded measure of real NNP growth. Under CRS, the measures can be related to the value of per capita stock changes and per capita NNP growth, using a result due to Arrow et al. (2003). The results are compared to those arising when instantaneous well-being depends only on per capita consumption.

AB Nowadays, an attractive legislative and financing framework has been established in Greece for the development of renewable energy sources. This has resulted in a strong increase of investors' interest, especially in the islands, mainly due to their high renewable energy potential all year round.
   However, the typical characteristics of the small Greek island, which constitute sensitive ecosystems with unique attributes of a natural and cultural heritage, impose a limitation on the development of energy generation plants using renewables. In order to adopt the principles of sustainable development of these island regions, the application of the proportionality principle in relation to other general principles of environmental law is proposed as a suitable legislative tool for resolution of the foreseeable conflicts.

SO ENGINEERING GEOLOGY
LA English
DT Article

   countries; Nicaragua
ID LANDSLIDE HAZARD; RISK
AB Although developing countries are vulnerable to landslide hazard, they generally lack policies for hazard assessment and mitigation. This may be attributed to the scarcity of good quality data on which to base any sound hazard assessment in addition to insufficient funds and lack of political will. Thus, there is an urgent need for developing feasible methodologies of landslide hazard assessment and mitigation, which can be readily tested and implemented under the conditions found in these countries. To this end, we selected an area of about 20 km(2) badly affected by Hurricane Mitch in October 1998, in the Departamento de Chinandega (NW Nicaragua). Mass movements (mainly debris flows) produced during the Hurricane Mitch rainfall event were investigated using two sets of aerial photographs at 1:60,000 and 1:40,000 scales. Data concerning regolith composition and thickness, landslide dimensions, failure slope angle and land use were obtained for 150 mass movements, and over 450 landslides were mapped at 1:10,000 scale in the field. A pragmatic approach was used to produce a qualitative hazard (sensu lato) assessment, based on the concepts of number of events recorded, predictability and susceptibility. This case study shows that a hazard assessment that is useful for management may be possible even where data are limited. Despite its inherent limitations, similar pragmatic approaches could help the sustainable development of other rural and sparsely populated areas of Central America. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

AB An understanding of the dynamic process of urban growth is a prerequisite to the prediction of land-cover change and the support of urban development planning and sustainable growth management. The spatial and temporal complexity inherent in urban growth requires the development of a new simulation approach, which should be process-oriented and have a strong interpretive element. In this paper the authors present an innovative methodology for understanding spatial processes and their temporal dynamics on two interrelated scales-the municipality and project scale-by means of a multistage framework and a dynamic weighting concept. The multistage framework is aimed at modelling local spatial processes and global temporal dynamics by the incorporation of explicit decisionmaking processes. It is divided into four stages: project planning, site selection, local growth, and temporal control. These four stages represent the interactions between top-down and bottom-up decisionmaking involved in land development in large-scale projects. Project-based cellular automata modelling is developed for interpreting the spatial and temporal logic between various projects that form the whole of urban growth. Use of dynamic weighting is an attempt to model local temporal dynamics at the project level as an extension of the local growth stage. As nonlinear function of temporal land development, dynamic weighting can link spatial processes and temporal patterns. The methodology is tested with reference to the urban growth of a fast growing city-Wuhan, in the People's Republic of China-from 1993 to 2000. The findings from this research suggest that this methodology can be used to interpret and visualise the dynamic process of urban growth temporally and transparently, globally and locally.

AB This paper investigates how demographic (socioeconomic) and land-use (physical and environmental) data can be integrated within a decision support framework to formulate and evaluate land-use planning scenarios. A case-study approach is undertaken with land-use planning scenarios for a rapidly growing coastal area in Australia, the Shire of Hervey Bay. The town and surrounding area require careful planning of the future urban growth between competing land uses. Three potential urban growth scenarios are put forth to address this issue. Scenario A ('continued growth') is based on existing socioeconomic trends. Scenario B ('maximising rates base') is derived using optimisation modelling of land-valuation data. Scenario C ('sustainable development') is derived using a number of social, economic, and environmental factors and assigning weightings of importance to each factor using a multiple criteria analysis approach. The land-use planning scenarios are presented through the use of maps and tables within a geographical information system, which delineate future possible land-use allocations up until 2021. The planning scenarios are evaluated by using a goal-achievement matrix approach. The matrix is constructed with a number of criteria derived from key policy objectives outlined in the regional growth management framework and town planning schemes. The authors of this paper examine the final efficiency scores calculated for each of the three planning scenarios and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the three land-use modelling approaches used to formulate the final scenarios.

ID CELLULAR-AUTOMATON MODEL; SAN-FRANCISCO; COVER
AB Declining water quality in the Chesapeake Bay estuary is in part the result of disruptions in the hydrological system caused by urban and suburban development throughout its 167000 km(2) watershed. A modeling system that could provide regional assessments of future development and explore the potential impacts of different regional management scenarios would be useful for a wide range of applications relevant to the future health of the Bay and its tributaries. We describe and test a regional predictive modeling system that could be used to meet these needs. An existing cellular automaton model, SLEUTH, was applied to a 23 700 km(2) area centered on the Washington - Baltimore metropolitan region, which has experienced rapid land-use change in recent years. The model was calibrated using a historic time series of developed areas derived from remote sensing imagery, and future growth was projected out to 2030 assuming three different policy scenarios: (1) current trends, (2) managed growth, and (3) ecologically sustainable growth. The current trends scenario allowed areas on the urban fringe that are currently rural or forested to be developed, which would have implications for water quality in the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries. The managed growth and ecologically sustainable scenarios produced growth patterns that were more constrained and which consumed less natural resource land. This application of the SLEUTH model demonstrates an ability to address a range of regional planning issues, but spatial accuracy and scale sensitivity are among the factors that must be further considered for practical application.

ID PLANNING-THEORY; PARTICIPATION; GOVERNANCE
AB Sustainability may be viewed as a principled form of conduct. Among its effects is a growing emphasis on civil society and local governance through which the members of communities are encouraged to rethink democratic ideas and practices, and reconfigure how to live. Although normative, sustainability cannot properly be conceived as prescriptive; such a characteristic would undermine central elements of it, such as participation and equity. In this sense, requiring both mechanisms for community participation in decisionmaking and planning, and an ethic of engagement based on trust, reciprocity, and an acceptance of the rights of noncitizens and nonhuman nature, sustainability might also be construed as a deliberative form of democratic governance. Perhaps problematically, in the last decade this governmental aspect of sustainability has come to be associated with the procedures of communicative rationality. Supported by research conducted over three years in a local government in Tasmania, Australia, we argue that a deliberative and democratic praxis of sustainability may be effective only if and when underpinned by substantive changes to the exercise of power and leadership, and to the ways in which deliberative decisionmaking and planning are pursued.

AB Hatchery propagation of salmonids has been practiced in western North America for over a century. However, recent declines in wild salmon abundance and efforts to mitigate these declines through hatcheries have greatly increased the relative abundance of fish produced in hatcheries. The over-harvest of wild salmon by fishing mixed hatchery and wild stocks has been of concern for many years but genetic interactions between populations, such as hybridization, introgression and outbreeding depression, may also compromise the sustainability of wild populations. Our goal was to examine whether a newly established hatchery population of steelhead trout successfully reproduced in the wild and to compare their rate of reproductive success to that of sympatrically spawning native steelhead. We used eight microsatellite loci to create allele frequency profiles for baseline hatchery and wild populations and assigned the smolt (age 2) offspring of this parental generation to a population of origin. Adults originating from a generalized hatchery stock artificially selected for early return and spawning date were successful at reproducing in Forks Creek, Washington. Although hatchery females (N = 90 and 73 in the two consecutive years of the study) produced offspring that survived to emigrate as smolts, they produced only 4.4-7.0% the number produced per wild female (N = 11 and 10). This deficit in reproductive success implies that the proportion of hatchery genes in the mixed population may diminish since deliberate releases into the river have ceased. This hypothesis is being tested in a long-term study at Forks Creek.

AB Concern about increasing rates of deforestation of tropical forests has resulted in investigations into the viability of local land-use practices and communal forms of governance. The majority of people in Guatemala live in regions where primary forests are absent. Several secondary forests in the highly populated highlands of Guatemala are communally managed forests, and people depend on forest products from these secondary forests for their livelihood. This study examines changes in forest structure and coverage of a native Pinus oocarpa Schiede communally managed forest in San Jose La Arada, Chiquimula in eastern Guatemala from 1954-1996. The pine forest is a municipal-communal property. The municipality has title to the land, however the forests are communal property. Neither forest committees in the villages nor municipal government regulations establish communal management of the pine forest; instead there are customary rules in the villages that guide forest extraction. People from the surrounding villages extract fuelwood, ocote (resin-rich wood harvested from the tree trunk and used for kindling) and timber from the pine forest. The P. oocarpa forest is situated in a seasonally dry region with nutrient-poor and highly eroded soils. Aerial photographs from 1954 and 1987 were compared to estimated changes in forest cover. Changes in forest structure are based on data collected from stand inventories conducted in 1987 and 1996. The pine fores was reduced in area by 14.4%, from 12.39 km(2) in 1954 to 10.61 km(2) in 1987. Additionally, stand density and basal area were reduced by 12% and 41%, respectively, from 1987-1996. Fuelwood and timber for domestic use were not extracted at a sustainable rate between 1954 and 1996 from the communally managed pine forest in this study. A sustainable-use management plan, in which all villages surrounding the forest participate, is recommended to provide future forest products for the villages.

AB Rising demand for medicinal plants has led to increased pressure on wild plant populations. This, combined with shrinking habitats, means that many species in South Africa are now facing local extinction. In 1997, a study was initiated to determine the extent of trade in medicinal plants in the South African Lowveld (the low lying plains to the east of the Drakensberg escarpment), and to investigate socio-economic factors influencing trade and resource management. Trade was not as extensive in the Lowveld as in major urban markets such as Durban or the Witwatersrand (Johannesburg and surrounding towns), either in terms of the quantity, number or range of species sold, or the numbers of people relying on the trade for an income. In markets assessed in Mpumalanga Province, 176 species were identified (71% of the vernacular names encountered in the market place), representing 69 plant families. In Limpopo, 70 different species were identified (84% of the vernacular names encountered in the market place), representing 40 families. Imports were significant in Mpumalanga (33% of the plants on offer), mainly from Mozambique. A detrended correspondence analysis showed substantial differences between species traded in Mpumalanga and those sold in Limpopo. There was little variation in the species stocked by vendors in Mpumalanga, regardless of the season, the attributes of the seller, or whether business was carried out in urban or rural areas. In contrast, there was considerable variation in the stock inventories of the Limpopo traders. Despite the lower levels of local trade, increased harvesting pressure is being experienced regionally, to meet demand in metropolitan centres such as the Witwatersrand. This study showed considerable local variation and complexities in the harvesting and marketing of medicinal plants, with both a national and an international dimension. This dual spatial scale presents both opportunities and challenges in the management of these plants, which need to be addressed simultaneously, particularly with respect to research requirements and development of predictive models and capacity. Cooperation in conservation strategies and policies is required at regional, national and international levels, while ensuring that management initiatives take into account local market conditions and the socio-economic realities facing both consumers and those who depend on the trade for their livelihoods.

ID INDICATORS
AB The ecological footprint (EF) can be used to investigate relationships between population, environment and development. In China, the per Caput EF is estimated to have increased by 83% between 1981 (0.82 ha caput(-1)) and 2000 (1.49 ha caput(-1)), to about 1.31 times China's area (including its oceanic territory), while the ecological deficit increased from 0.066 ha caput(-1) in 1981 to 0.735 ha caput(-1) in 2000. Over this period, the proportions of six sub-footprint types have changed considerably: the percentages of arable, fossil energy and forest land decreased from 44.8%, 41.5% and 4.1% to 27.1%, 40.1% and 3.0%, respectively; while sea, pasture and built-up land percentages increased from 3.8%, 4.4% and 1.3% to 15.2%, 12.4% and 2.2%, respectively. The production coefficients of gross domestic product (GDP) to the EF of China increased from 584 RMB ha(-1) in 1981, to 1522 RMB ha(-1) in 2000, reflecting an increasing efficiency in resource use. The EF correlates positively with disposable income and expenditure, which can be described by income and expenditure elasticity. Some measures are suggested to decrease the Chinese ecological deficit on the road to sustainability.

AB The local branches of the Russian Forestry Service, the leskhozy, were known for their efficiency and management skills in the Soviet era and were one of the very few community-based "Soviet-type" institutions to survive the transition. This article examines the role of the leskhozy in the new market economy. Our analysis is based on data from interviews with informants attached to the forestry sector in the Murmansk area. In some cases their knowledge of the leskhozy stretches back to the emergence of the system in 1947. Our principal finding is that the struggle to survive as a federal body in the current legal and economic climate is forcing the leskhozy to relegate sustainable forestry management, presumably their primary raison d'etre, to the lower portions of their list of priorities. Several consequences result. There is a heightened incidence of illegal logging, and corruption informs the allocation of forest areas to private interests. Stumpage prices have plummeted as timber from subsidized commercial cutting (ostensibly sanitary cutting or thinning) has flooded the markets. The root cause of these tribulations lies with the market-based harvesting permit system. Its introduction in the 1990s did little to eliminate the self-seeking practices of the old Soviet forestry management hierarchies. In the free market, local forestry managers can turn their dual responsibilities to their own advantage inasmuch as they control the allocation of harvesting permits while at the same time controlling logging practices.

AB Rising global interest in sustainability has triggered attention in indicators as a means of achieving a more sustainable world. Although the search for indicators has led to the development of criteria for good indicators, it has also been dominated by scientific elites. The consequences of such dominance leads to significant social and policy implications, particularly with regard to how the search for sustainability has become defined primarily as a technical/scientific exploration when it is actually a moral and ethical issue. Our discussion about sustainability and appropriate indicators centers on what constitutes the public interest, a question that requires inclusiveness and centers on the interface of science and policy. The paper reviews the rationale for selecting indicators, the functions they serve, and the implications and consequences involved when one sector-science-dominates the debate. The paper concludes with suggestions about appropriate roles of science, policy and the public in the indicator selection process.

AB This contribution examines the potential impact of eastern enlargement on EU environmental governance. Whereas some observers see eastern enlargement as a potential threat to EU environmental governance, this contribution argues that it should be seen as an opportunity to intensify ongoing reform efforts. This view is based on three main premises. First, enlargement is likely to have a differential effect on the three governance regimes which together constitute EU environmental policy. Second, the threat that enlargement poses to one of these regimes is in fact already producing reactions that may allow the regime to continue to operate in the context of an enlarged EU. Third, enlargement may reinforce emerging shifts among the regimes, which answer to the larger challenge of sustainable development.

AB Non-governmental organisations (NGOs) have been intensively involved in rural development in Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries. Many of these organisations are not only initiating efforts to protect the environment, but are also leading forces for social and economic development in the rural areas in which they work. This contribution looks at the principles of sustainable rural development and suggests that pre-accession initiatives undertaken by the EU that are relevant to rural areas have largely missed this mark. The study then examines specific examples of the ways that NGOs have taken the lead in developing practical models for addressing the problems and particular needs of rural areas in CEE countries.

AB This contribution focuses on the limits of European Union programmes and accession practices on environmental policies and performance in Central and Eastern Europe. In particular, we document some of the ways in which state socialist and post-socialist environmental conditions, practices and policies are shaping, and in turn being shaped by, the path of accession and integration. We focus on the diverse and changing patterns of air, water and soil quality in Central and Eastern Europe, the contested nature of new environmental policies, the environmental consequences of economic change, and the sustainability of emerging environmental regimes. The contribution concludes with several questions about the consequences of new state membership for future EU environmental policies.

AB This contribution assesses the impact of market liberalisation on the sustainability of the transformation in ten Central and East European countries (CEE10). Although a significant body of literature assesses economic and social consequences of the transformation, there are limited numbers of investigations that examine the impact of liberalisation on the environment. For CEE countries, assessing environmental effects of structural change in the economy, rising personal consumption, rapid transition to market-oriented economies, and dramatically increased liberalisation is critical. Equally important is assessing the outcomes of environmental and other policy and institutional reforms. To assess these changes, a set of sustainability indicators is used to estimate an environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) and sustainability trends. The EKC concept assumes that environmental pressure rises initially with an increase in income but declines beyond some estimated level or 'turning point'. The question is how market liberalisation has affected this observed relationship. This study demonstrates the progress of the CEE 10, relative to other CEE and new independent states (NIS), and how much progress is still needed to secure more sustainable development.

AB This contribution analyses six challenges with which candidate countries must successfully cope if they are to fulfil the environmental acquis and promote the more fundamental goal of building a sustainable environment in Central and Eastern Europe. These six challenges are as follows: (1) the fiscal challenge of providing requisite monies; (2) the administrative challenge of building both institutional and staffing capacity; (3) the environmental challenge of promoting a sustainable environment while fulfilling the acquis; (4) the 'democratic deficit' challenge of ensuring substantive input for Pox Populi; (5) the energy challenge of reducing the excessive consumption of environmentally threatening fuels and coping with dangerous Soviet-built nuclear power stations; (6) the political challenge of mobilising the support necessary to respond effectively to these foregoing challenges. It concludes that we should be cautiously optimistic about the prospects for environmental accession.

CY 2002
CL Washington, DC
AB Central and East European (CEE) states are implementing sweeping environmental policy reforms as they gain EU membership. This concluding chapter draws attention to key arguments in the volume and elaborates on four key themes that enrich conventional notions about Europeanisation and challenge prevailing views about the impacts that CEE states are having on environmental quality in an enlarged EU: the importance of capacity limitations and efforts to address them, the pesence of mixed messages and conflicting EU priorities, the importance of non-state actors, and the need for multi-directional exchange of ideas and information. These themes suggest, among other things, that EU officials and programs are capable of greatly improving some areas of environmental policy in CEE countries even as they make some areas of policy and societal behaviour less sustainable. This essay includes discussions of some possible ramifications of a larger EU for global environmental governance and some lessons from the 2004 enlargement that may inform understanding of future rounds of EU expansion.

AB The transport of runoff with high copper concentrations and sediment loads into adjacent surface waters can have adverse effects on nontarget organisms as a result of increased turbidity and degraded water quality. Runoff from vegetable production utilizing polyethylene mulch can contain up to 35% of applied copper, a widely used fungicide/bactericide that has adverse effects on aquatic organisms. Copper is primarily transported in runoff with suspended particulates; therefore, implementation of management practices that minimize soil erosion will reduce copper loads. Replacing bare-soil furrows with furrows planted in rye (Secale cereale) significantly improved the sustainability of vegetable production with polyethylene mulch and reduced the potential environmental impact of this management practice. Vegetative furrows decreased runoff volume by >40% and soil erosion by >80%. Copper loads with runoff were reduced by 72% in 2001, primarily as a result of reduced soil erosion since more than 88% of the total copper loads were transported in runoff with suspended soil particulates. Tomato yields in both years were similar between the polyethylene mulch plots containing either bare-soil or vegetative furrows. Replacing bare-soil furrows with vegetative furrows greatly reduces the effects of sediments and agrochemicals on sensitive ecosystems while maintaining crop yields.

AB The climate change problem involves long-term global efforts through sustainable development. The international burden sharing of greenhouse gases (GHG) abatement constitutes a controversial debate. Equity is an important issue to be considered in the mitigation policies to insure the participation of as many developing countries as possible. The main purpose of this research is to allocate equitable international GHG emission entitlements using several criteria. There are many equity definitions and some are conflicting. A dynamical multicriterion method is proposed to compare various alternatives and to find a compromise solution. If the decision-making process can take into account interests and preoccupations of every country, significant progress could be made to achieve a world consensus. Several burden sharing schemes are proposed. Then, modeling abatement scenarios using the TIMES world energy model will allow us to determine the cost-effectiveness opportunities.

AB In this paper we present and illustrate using real-life data a framework for managing an investment portfolio in which the investment opportunities are described in terms of a set of attributes and part of this set is intended to capture the effects on society. Here we link with the emerging literature on SRI: socially responsible investment. Given the multi-attribute descriptions of the individual investment opportunities we show how these can be combined into portfolios with the same attributes at the portfolio level. Also we show how a manager can systematically be supported in the choice between different portfolio profiles. As part of the framework we use multi-criteria decision tools. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

AB The purpose of this paper is to investigate the important relationship between risk taking and competitive advantage. Over the last two decades, a range of theoretical frameworks, drawn from behavioral decision theory, agency theory and strategic management have examined organizational risk-return trade-offs. This paper develops a model for the strategic management of risk. A dynamic model of competitive strategy linking risk and competition is presented, in which strategic reference points and risk attitudes are endogenously determined and influence riskheturn performance. Following Shapira's (1995) arguments that good managers take high risk but are able to reduce it over time, we highlight the relevance of managing risk taking to achieve competitive advantage and then show how risk-seeking organizations can strategically achieve sustainable high returns at low risk.

ID FISH
AB Three simple fisheries indicators are presented: (i) percentage of mature fish in catch, with 100%, as target; (ii) percent of specimens with optimum length in catch, with 100% as target; and (iii) percentage of 'mega-spawners' in catch, with 0% as target, and 30-40% as representative of reasonable stock structure if no upper size limit exists. Application of these indicators to stocks of Gadus morhua, Sardinella aurita and Epinephelus aeneus demonstrate their usefulness. It is argued that such simple indicators have the potential to allow more stakeholders such as fishers, fish dealers, supermarket managers, consumers and politicians to participate in fisheries management and eventually hold and reverse the global pattern of convenience overfishing, which is defined here as deliberate overfishing sanctioned by official bodies who find it more convenient to risk eventual collapse of fish stocks than to risk social and political conflicts.

AB This study documents the resource management initiatives undertaken by fishing cooperatives in Capiz, central Philippines and examines the conditions and the socioeconomic determinants that persuade members to assume responsibility for managing nearshore resources. The results show that in the absence of formal resource management schemes, cooperative members adopt self-management strategies to protect their resource base only if the sustainability of their livelihood is seriously threatened. There is no impediment to female cooperative members (62%) participating in resource management. The factors that positively influenced members' participation were the number of children, perceived fishery conditions, awareness of mangrove conservation and rehabilitation, and assessment of enforcement of the ban on dynamite and cyanide fishing. Fishing cooperatives, however, fail as a source of information on regulation and conservation education of members. But if they were to under-take more education and training programs on nearshore management, cooperatives may become an effective social force in changing the present fisheries management system.

AB Typical contamination and the frequency of misuse of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) bottles are crucial parameters in the risk assessment of post-consumer recycled (PCR) PET intended for bottle-to-bottle recycling for direct food contact applications. Owing to the fact that misuse of PET bottles is a rare event, sustainable knowledge about the average concentration of hazardous compounds in PCR PET is accessible only by the screening of large numbers of samples. In order to establish average levels of contaminants in PET source materials for recycling, PET flakes from commercial washing plants (689 samples), reprocessed pellets (38) and super-clean pellets (217) were collected from 12 European countries between 1997 and 2001. Analysis of these materials by headspace gas chromatography revealed average and maximum levels in PCR PET of 18.6 and 86.0 mg kg(-1) for acetaldehyde and 2.9 and 20 mg kg(-1) for limonene, respectively. Acetaldehyde and limonene are typical compounds derived from PET itself and from prior PET bottle contents (flavouring components), respectively. Maximum levels in PCR PET of real contaminants such as misuse chemicals like solvents ranged from 1.4 to 2.7 mg kg(-1) , and statistically were shown to result from 0.03 to 0.04% of recollected PET bottles that had been misused. Based on a principal component analysis of the experimental data, the impact of the recollecting system and the European Union Member State where the post-consumer PET bottles had been collected on the nature and extent of adventitious contaminants was not significant. Under consideration of the cleaning efficiency of super-clean processes as well as migration from the bottle wall into food, it can be concluded that the consumer will be exposed at maximum to levels <50 ng total misuse chemicals day(-1) . Therefore, PCR PET materials and articles produced by modern super-clean technologies can be considered to be safe in direct food applications in the same way as virgin food-grade PET.

ID MANAGEMENT
AB The Aboriginal Forest Planning Process (AFPP) was developed to integrate indigenous and western forest management approaches. The AFPP is a participatory decision-making toot designed to enhance co-management of the John Prince Research Forest (JPRF) in central interior British Columbia, Canada and to elicit goals, objectives, criteria, and indicators of sustainable forest management from the JPRFs Aboriginal partners. Analysis of community interview transcripts, traditional land use documentation, and secondary sources resulted in a three-stage approach to information elicitation, management, and application. Resource and social values, concerns, and traditional knowledge are summarized and compiled according to criteria themes and sub-themes. This condensed information is further divided into spatial, quantitative, and qualitative criteria and indicator categories. The AFPP was a useful method for developing forest management goals, objectives and criteria; however, further interviews were required to identify appropriate management indicators.

ID FORESTRY; INCENTIVES; PROGRAM
AB States and provinces of the United States and Canada have defined practices to mitigate the negative externalities often associated with timber harvesting activities. This paper describes the various methods states and provinces employ to encourage the application of sustainable timber harvesting practices. Information on specific policy tools used to encourage guideline application was obtained through a written questionnaire to state and provincial forestry agency directors. All but one of the 51 responding states and provinces have some form of formally-defined timber harvesting practices. Practices that address riparian zone management, water quality, or wetlands protection are the most common-all but one responding state and province addresses one of more of these areas. Sixty-one percent of the states and provinces implement their practices through predominantly voluntary means whereas the remaining 39% are applied within a regulatory framework. Of the policy tools examined, technical assistance, educational, and cost-share programs account for 88% of all state and provincial programs directed at encouraging forest landowners to use the practices suggested in their guidebooks. Technical assistance and education programs are the most common policy tools used to assist loggers and foresters in applying sustainable harvesting practices. Technical assistance and cost-share programs consistently rank among the most effective policy tools for encouraging loggers, landowners, and foresters to apply the sustainable timber harvesting practices. Comparing levels of program investment to perceived benefits, assistance programs and education programs rank most efficient for landowners and foresters, respectively. Premium prices for products and preferential access to contracts are the two most efficient programs directed at loggers, yet their existence is modest within states and provinces. The paper concludes with an assessment of emerging trends and additional information needs associated with encouraging the application of sustainable timber harvesting practices.

AB Conflicts over water quality regulation are entering local economic development policy and re-shaping political-economic landscapes. Across the United States, decentralizing scales of regulation, scientific uncertainty, and increasing citizen participation are creating new regulatory contexts. Using regime and regulation theory, I address how regulation of the environment is altering economic regimes and creating new alliances among stakeholders. The research shows the dominant regime in the state of Ohio, a pro-growth stakeholder coalition between point source businesses (including electric utilities and municipal sewage treatment plants) and real estate development interests, is fragmenting. At the same time, there is a policy coalition emerging between environmentalists and government staff that is advocating for nonpoint source water pollution regulation. These emergent coalitions exemplify the changing nature of environmental regulation and economic regimes. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Throughout the western world, public support for environmental protection measures has grown consistently during the past three decades. Endorsement for a wide array of measures to reduce the human impact on nature and conserve resources has been high among individuals in the UK, relating to a variety of environmental issues, such as transport, waste management, water quality and green consumerism. These stated concerns are somewhat in contrast to the behavioural responses which similar research projects have reported. This attitude-behaviour inconsistency, or more colloquially, the 'value-action gap', has become a major area of soul searching for policy makers who have used techniques such as contingent valuation and willingness to pay models to construct their policy measures. Accordingly, this paper presents an alternative means of investigating the attitude-behaviour inconsistency, with the use of research by social psychologists, sociologists and geographers. A framework of environmental behaviour is presented, so as to provide environmental researchers with a means of examining which variables modify the relationship between stated intention and action. The results indicate that whilst there is a moderately strong relationship between stated intention and behaviour, the factors influencing these two constructs are significantly different so as to suggest that public rhetoric towards environmental action may be influenced by different antecedents to that of actual behaviour. As such, the paper provides a fresh perspective on the difference between rhetoric and reality in environmental action. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Seasonal climate forecasts have been promoted as a means to increase the resilience of marginal groups in Africa. The manifestations of this are still to be seen. This paper argues that successful dissemination and adoption of the forecast requires an in-depth profile of the characteristics and needs of user groups. The case study of a mountainous village in southern Lesotho is used to highlight the decisions which one group of marginal users-smallholder farmers-might make in response to the forecast. A participatory role-play exercise explores what information households presently receive and how new climate forecast information could be integrated into seasonal decision making. Results show that there are a number of low-input options available to these farmers for responding to the forecast. Adoption, however, is going to require repeated exposure to the forecast in conjunction with forecast development that is suited to users' needs. The case study is linked back to the larger scale by suggesting paths that seasonal climate forecast development could take if it is to contribute to improving livelihood sustainability among marginal groups.

AB Recent changes in the cultural and forest landscapes of the Meseta Purepecha in Michoacan, Mexico as a result of forest degradation underscore the complexity of forest change processes in the tropical highlands of Latin America. Differences in community perception and forest structure and composition between the furniture-making and lumber-producing towns of Pichataro and Sevina, Purepechan indigenous communities located amidst pine forests on Michoacan's volcanic plateau illustrate the dynamics of this process. We base our comparisons on interviews and field measures of forest structure. Our results show dramatic changes in the forests and cultural landscapes of both communities during the past decade. Following high regional timber exports during the early 1990s, Sevina shifted from a self-sufficient to a timber importation community. By comparison, communal forests and individual parcels in Pichataro continue to provide wood for approximately 300 wood shops. Field data and forest stand maps confirm the perception of forest degradation in both communities. While Pichataro has maintained a larger and more diverse forest base to date, stand structure data indicate selective harvesting has led to a shift in dominance toward the less economically desirable pine species and oak. Deforestation and degradation of Sevina and Pichataro's community forests are symptomatic of both the Meseta Purepecha and Mexico in general. Current forest conditions in both communities justify local, regional, and national concerns regarding declining biodiversity and sustainable economies.

TI Decades of focus: Grant making at the John A. Hartford Foundation
SO HEALTH AFFAIRS
LA English
DT Article
AB Foundation grant making can play an important role in advancing the U.S. health agenda. However, given the scale of the health care system and the intractability of many of its problems, philanthropy must be guided by strategic thinking in pursuit of realistically achievable goals. This essay describes the grant-making process at one nationally oriented foundation as an example of how these challenges might be approached. We believe that greater clarity about this process can improve collaboration among foundations, help the public appreciate foundations' work, facilitate partnerships with grantees, and, most importantly, yield sustainable improvement in the problem being addressed.

SO HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING
LA English
DT Article
AB The paper examines the validity of two indices of sustainability: family planning programme sustainability (PSI) and outcome sustainability (OSI) developed by Tsui and Knight (1997) by applying their original method to recent data. The indices succeed in identifying the directional path of programme and outcome sustainability. Close correlations are found between PSI and OSI predicted values and actual programme and outcome values. The indices provide a repeatable method for measuring sustainability, although they are sensitive to data measurement errors. The indices provide a policy tool for funding decisions but should be used with other data sources to judge sustainability.

AB Malaria remains a major health problem in Africa. One preventative strategy currently advocated is the use of bednets, preferably treated with insecticide. Many approaches to bednet delivery have been adopted in Kenya, including an employer-based malaria control strategy (EBMC). The cost and sustainability of this approach have not previously been assessed. This paper presents the financial cost (cash expenditure) of the EBMC programme implemented in the Coastal and Western regions of Kenya by the African Medical and Research Foundation (AMREF) between April 1998 and February 2002. Getting a bednet and insecticide to an employee was estimated to cost the provider US$15.8. This could be reduced by US$0.5 if the remaining stocks were liquidated and by an additional US$1.3 if the salvage of capital items is considered. The venture of distributing bednets to employees through the programme proved lucrative to organized community groups (OCGs), for they made between 24 and 29% gross profit from the nets they sold. Consequently, OCGs in nine of the 13 companies involved had retained enough funds from which they could buy and sell bednets without further donor financial support, and this portrays some elements of a sustainable supply system.

AB In health promotion, enthusiasm for sustainability has frequently overshadowed critical reflection with regard to whether this aim is warranted, let alone feasible. Consequently, the not insubstantial body of literature on sustainability in health promotion is not particularly helpful to decision makers. In this paper we seek to provide some guidance for the development of sustainability for health promotion interventions, arguing that it is necessary to be able to differentiate between (i) levels of social organization which are the focus of change, (ii) the programmes and agencies which are the means employed to achieve change, and (iii) the outcomes or effects that are achieved. Furthermore, funding allocations need to be congruent with programme characteristics if one is serious about achieving sustainability.

AB To study the possibility of using atelocollagen as an oligonucleotide (ODN) delivery carrier in vivo, the activity of formulated antisense ODN targeted against the intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) mRNA was investigated in an allergic dermatitis model in mice. The allergic dermatitis was elicited in one ear of animals sensitized by treatment with 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene. Antisense ODN was given to the animals as a single intravenous injection of formulation containing atelocollagen. Antisense activity was determined by measurement of ear thickness, histopathology, and immunohistochemistry 24 hr after the initiation of the dermatitis. Antisense activity was found to increase according to the concentration of atelocollagen in the formulation. The effect mediated by the ODN formulated with 0.05% atelocollagen was more than 50 times greater than that provided by ODN infusion, although the levels of ODN formulated with atelocollagen dropped below that of the 24-hr infusion group within 30 min. The formulated ODN could suppress inflammatory progression by treatment at 8 hr after the ear challenge when inflammation had already commenced at the challenged site. Moreover, antisense activity was noted even when the formulated ODN was injected 3 days before the initiation of inflammation. These data demonstrate that atelocollagen can enhance antisense activity remarkably and that the sustainable antisense activity mediated by the formulation of ODN with atelocollagen could completely change the strategy of antisense therapeutics.

ID DROUGHT
AB This paper examines the interactions between the environment, political and economic policies, and changes in land use and land quality by focusing on one region in northwest Mexico where dramatic transformations have occurred since the early 1970s. A political ecology approach is used to examine the nature and causes of environmental change at different scales of analysis, to address the importance of meanings assigned to ecological systems, and the effect of human-environmental interactions on natural resources. The objective of the study is to uncover the different circumstances under which farmers and ranchers have affected environmental change and how land-use decisions interact with political, economic, and environmental drivers through history. An emphasis is placed on the complexity of interactions between drivers and on understanding differences in perspectives between large-scale commercial ranchers, more diversified small-scale farmers and ejidatarios, bureaucrats, and environmentalists. The study concludes that strategies for reducing deforestation and developing reasonable community based plans that promote sustainable livelihoods must consider the local and external causes of deforestation, the difficulty of environmental monitoring, and intraregional differences in environmental and socioeconomic parameters.

DE common property; community; wastewater management; public
   infrastructure; Guatemala
ID COMMONS
AB This article assesses recent efforts in a multiethnic town in the Guatemalan highlands to address wastewater pollution, which threatens public health and tourism, the basis of the town's economy. Reporting on an ongoing program of action research, the authors trace the erosion of traditional, Mayan civic and religious institutions that were previously responsible for maintenance of a collective waterworks infrastructure, which in recent years has become the conduit for untreated sewage. They detail how a wastewater treatment plant was built in the town with external expertise and finance, and with little regard for its social and institutional sustainability, and they analyze how local government, business associations, and nongovernmental organizations are now taking steps to address these shortcomings. Treating community not as a fixed social unit but as a network of social interactions that are continually remade, the authors argue that while state and market forces have undermined traditional institutions of local governance, they may also become foci for reasserting community and rebuilding the relationships of shared responsibility necessary to manage the commons. The challenge for development practitioners working in public infrastructure and other domains is to integrate project planning and implementation into processes of community building.

TI Fish discourse: Russia, Norway, and the northeast Arctic cod
SO HUMAN ORGANIZATION
LA English
DT Article
DE discourse analysis; fisheries management; Barents Sea; Northeast Arctic
   cod; East-West relations; Russia; Norway
AB The article argues that discourse analysis can help explain why Russian and Norwegian fishery authorities set quotas for the Northeast Arctic cod far above scientific recommendations in 1999-2001. While the "sustainability discourse" dominated on the Norwegian side-framing discussions in terms of whether quotas were "sustainable" or not-the Russian discourse centered around the battle between the two nations involved. According to the "cold peace discourse," Norway wants to reduce the quota to ensure competitive prices for cod on the world market or, alternatively, simply to "ruin Russia." The "seafaring community discourse" feeds on distrust on both sides of the border of scientific prognoses and serves to weaken the arguments of the "sustainability discourse" and strengthen the conclusions of the "cold peace discourse." The "pity-the-Russians discourse" offers a way out of the deadlock: feeding on the Western perception of Russians as "poor," the Norwegians are ready to set scientific recommendations aside on humanitarian grounds. Overarching discourses in society provided "windows of opportunity" for the given outcomes. Notably, the "cold peace discourse" made it possible for Russian ship owners to argue against a quota reduction, and the "pity-the-Russians discourse" made it acceptable for the Norwegians to agree to Russian claims.

AB Quantification of the source of suspended sediments generated by selective forestry activities is central to the development of sustainable forestry guidelines. This assessment is hampered by a dearth of available studies, particularly from the tropics. This study involved the monitoring (at 10 s intervals) of surface discharge and turbidity from 15 contributory areas of a 44 ha catchment. The catchment is located within lowland dipterocarp rain forest on Borneo Island, in a region recovering from the first episode of selective timber removal that took place some 5 years previously. Both the within-storm dynamics of the sediment flux and the time-integrated sediment yields were analysed to link the source landforms to the catchment behaviour.
   A 10 year rainfall event of 167 mm occurred during the monitoring period and triggered a debris slide and several log-culvert collapses along the area's main timber haulage road. The sampling design captured this event's dynamics and allowed lumped catchment response to be traced to the new landforms. During the I day period of the 10 year event, some 33 t of suspended sediment were transported from one debris slide, comprising a significant proportion of the 105 t discharging from the whole catchment, which itself constituted 40% of the annual yield of 592 t km(-2). The contributory areas with only ephemeral waterflows, including former haulage roads and tracks, generated relatively little sediment during this 10 year event or in other storms. This work suggests that though some sediment sources recover from the impacts of forest road construction and harvesting, collapse of roadfill materials or more local log-culvert failure persists for several years after harvesting. Sustainable forestry guidelines that do not focus on ameliorating these persistent instabilities may not significantly mitigate the geomorphic impacts of conventional, selective harvesting.

AB The problems of poverty are complex, and tackling them demands cooperation between specialists with diverse backgrounds in both the natural and social sciences. Calls for interdisciplinary research in development are therefore siren. Yet facilitating such interdisciplinary work, by for example the current sustainable livelihoods approach, has proved difficult. This paper reflects on personal experiences working with research teams in development contexts in Asia and the Pacific, seasoned with some comments on the British higher education environment from my position as head of a university department, in an attempt to locate problems in interdisciplinary research and suggest ways forward. It eschews talk of solutions, since the forces at work appear simultaneously both to promote and hinder interdisciplinary research. It is more appropriate instead to think in terms of a balancing act - of accommodating different perspectives while facilitating interpenetration, of challenging narrow disciplinary views without threatening intellectual tumult. The emerging approach of indigenous knowledge research, which is evolving from the relatively new participatory approaches to development, is put forward as a promising context in which to advance interdisciplinary research. This is an approach with roots in anthropology, which itself has a long tradition of working in an interdisciplinary way - but in common with other broadbased disciplines, such as geography, it also therefore experiences problems of disciplinary integrity. The discussion concludes by asking why such disciplines have been more effective as engines of interdisciplinary research, and suggests that they encounter problems of squaring depth with breadth. I argue that by focusing on indigenous knowledge, that is by allowing local perspectives to play a prominent role in any project, interdisciplinary research should be facilitated, since such knowledge is inherently holistic in perspective. Even so, problems remain, many of them apparently inescapable given the paradoxes characterising interdisciplinary research, compounded by the conundrums of crosscultural communication.

ID SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB The notion of interdisciplinarity looks attractive on paper but remains poorly defined. This creates many difficulties in its application, especially when natural sciences are combined with social sciences, and even more so in applied research involving local communities. Taking a case study of fish farming in Tabasco, Mexico, this paper argues that a significant barrier to addressing farmers' problems is that farmers think in interdisciplinary terms, while professionals are still ruled by disciplinary boundaries. Farmers address farming problems in the same way they face all other life situations, in other words not by labelling various components of a problem 'physical', 'social' or 'economic', and by looking for links between them, but by conceiving of problems as a whole, to which solutions must be found by the analysis of total reality. This creates a communication gap between professionals and farmers, which results in failures when development programmes are implemented. The recognition of the interdisciplinary approach of farmers in analysing their reality is not the solution to the problem per se, since science has been constructed around separate disciplines and so adoption of the farmers' approach looks unscientific. The challenge is thus to present farmers with ways of analysing farming problems in organised ways. This will require the creation of new research methodologies and will necessitate changes to the academic writing of interdisciplinary research.

AB The long-term success of Joint Forest Management (JFM) appears doubtful unless people's dependence on forests is reduced to non-timber forest produce, small timber, firewood for bonafide domestic use and indirect benefits. For this the issues of poverty alleviation, sustainable development, empowerment and forest regeneration have to be dealt with simultaneously. While elucidating the concept and approach of Sustainable Livelihoods (SL), this paper makes a case for its adoption in forest areas. Further it analyses the Tamilnadu Afforestation Project and its evolution into a Sustainable Livelihood Project. The paper concludes with the observation that JFM projects can be converted into SL projects through enhanced outlay for buffer zones, integration of line departments, increasing the duration and decentralisation of more powers to JFM institutions.

AB A plug-in fuel cell hybrid with as little as 20 mile of range from rechargeable hydrogen could displace more than 50% of the gasoline consumed in the US. While the well-to-wheel efficiencies are poor, proper utilization of the grid electricity along with electrical infrastructure modifications would lead to acceptable and sustainable overall efficiencies. The limited-range plug-in option provides a viable transition technology toward a hydrogen refueling infrastructure. The technology is also sustainable and available on a short timeline.

AB Based on a thermodynamic and economic analysis presented in the first part of this paper, ethanol is considered as an alternative fuel with suitable characteristics for electricity generation in SOFCs. Ethanol fed steam reformer-SOFC systems attain high theoretical efficiencies in the range of 83.7-93.4% operating at carbon-free conditions between 800 and 1200 K. These efficiencies classify ethanol as the second most valuable fuel option for SOFCs after natural gas, higher than important other fuel candidates such as gasoline and methanol. A discussion is made upon the benefits obtainable from the utilization of ethanol for generation of electricity in SOFCs and a complete "ethanol scenario" is proposed as a competitive energy policy and a step forward to the target of sustainable development. The analysis reveals the cost relations between each fuel scenario and focuses upon the measures required so as the "ethanol scenario" to break through the threshold of economic viability.

AB In line with sustainable development principles, the reactions to modern architecture and planning have led to a new appreciation of traditional cities and urban environments.
   Considering the extensive neglect and devastation of local values in our cities and towns, urban development practice in Turkey cannot be said to meet the requirements of sustainability. This paper, therefore, will explore the logic of sustainable development and focus on the components of good urban design which are needed to produce it. Since promoting sustainable lifestyles in our towns and cities depends mainly on the design of the physical environment, the paper will propose a set of key design principles that can deliver sustainable urban development through exploring the qualities of,traditional urbanism' in the Turkish cities as well as examining the latest approaches to urban design.

TI Eco-ethical issues: Self-regulating versus subsidized ecosystems

   ecosystems
AB Sustainable use of the planet requires dependable delivery of ecosystem services at a level necessary to meet the needs of humankind. During the last two centuries, particularly in the twentieth century, ecosystems have been fragmented and stressed in a variety of ways, including biotic impoverishment. Self-regulating ecosystems are capable of maintaining nominative structure and function, including normal variability Those ecosystems incapable of self regulation will require subsidies, which will divert resources from other activities that may also be important to sustainable use of the planet. If ecosystems are not subsidized, the loss of natural capital and ecosystem services will almost certainly impair the quest for sustainable use of the planet. Although most discussions of sustainability reflect an awareness of humankind's dependence on natural systems, ecosystem self regulation has not received an adequate amount of attention.
