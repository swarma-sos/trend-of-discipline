AB Chronic failures in marine fisheries management have led some to suggest that marine protected areas (MPAs) are the solution to achieve sustainable fisheries. While such systems work for certain habitat-specific and nonmobile species, their utility for highly mobile stocks is questionable. Often the debate among proponents and critics of MPAs is confused by a lack of appreciation of the goals and objectives of such systems. The current consideration of MPAs as the basis of future fisheries management is a symptom of, and not the singular solution to, the problem of inappropriate implementation of fishing effort controls. The latter will provide greater overall conservation benefits if properly applied. Any future use of MPAs as an effective tool to achieve sustainable fisheries management in temperate systems should be treated as a large-scale, rigorously designed experiment to ensure that the outcome of using MPAs is interpreted correctly and not discredited for false reasons.

AB In this paper, we propose an exploited single-species discrete model with stage structure for the dynamics in a fish population for which births occur in a single pulse once per time period. Using the stroboscopic map, we obtain an exact cycle of the system, and obtain the threshold conditions for its stability. Bifurcation diagrams are constructed with the birth rate as the bifurcation parameter, and these are observed to display complex dynamic behaviors, including chaotic bands with period windows, pitch-fork and tangent bifurcation. This suggests that birth pulse provides a natural period or cyclicity that makes the dynamical behavior more complex. Moreover, we show that the timing of harvesting has a strong impact on the persistence of the fish population, on the volume of mature fish stock and on the maximum annual-sustainable yield. An interesting result is obtained that, after the birth pulse, the earlier culling the mature fish, the larger harvest can tolerate. (C) 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Protection of the global environment and, in particular, providing a sustainable source of clean water is a necessity for human survival. The wide use of heavy metals by modern industries has generated by-products containing heavy metals. Specifically, large quantities of chromium and arsenic containing compounds are being discharged into the environment. This study has been conducted to determine the feasibility of an electrocoagulation (EC) process using air injection to remove these inorganic elements with iron electrodes. Powder X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and transmission Mossbauer spectroscopy were used to characterize the solid products formed at. iron electrodes during EC. The results of this study suggest that magnetite particles and amorphous iron oxyhydroxides are present in the examined EC products. The field pilot-scale study demonstrated the removal of Cr(VI)/Cr(III) and As(III)/As(V) with an efficiency of more than 99% from both wastewater and wells.

AB Important findings on the consequences of climate change for agriculture and forestry from the recently completed Third Assessment Report (TAR) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) are reviewed, with emphasis on new knowledge that emerged since the Second Assessment Report (SAR). The State-Pressure-Response-Adaptation model is used to organize the review. The major findings are:
   Constant or declining food prices are expected for at least the next 25 yr, although food security problems will persist in many developing countries as those countries deal with population increases, political crisis, poor resource endowments, and steady environmental degradation. Most economic model projections suggest that low relative food prices will extend beyond the next 25 yr, although our confidence in these projections erodes farther out into the 21st century.
   Although deforestation rates may have decreased since the early 1990s, degradation with a loss of forest productivity and biomass has occurred at large spatial scales as a result of fragmentation, non-sustainable practices and infrastructure development.
   According to United Nations estimates, approximately 23% of all forest and agricultural lands were classified as degraded over the period since World War II.
   At a worldwide scale, global change pressures (climate change, land-use practices and changes in atmospheric chemistry) are increasingly affecting the supply of goods and services from forests.
   The most realistic experiments to date - free air experiments in an irrigated environment - indicate that C-3 agricultural crops in particular respond favorably to gradually increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations (e.g., wheat yield increases by an average of 28%), although extrapolation of experimental results to real world production where several factors (e.g., nutrients, temperature, precipitation, and others) are likely to be limiting at one time or another remains problematic. Moreover, little is known of crop response to elevated CO2 in the tropics, as most of the research has been conducted in the mid-latitudes.
   Research suggests that for some crops, for example rice, CO2 benefits may decline quickly as temperatures warm beyond optimum photosynthetic levels. However, crop plant growth may benefit relatively more from CO2 enrichment in drought conditions than in wet conditions.
   The unambiguous separation of the relative influences of elevated ambient CO2 levels, climate change responses, and direct human influences (such as present and historical land-use change) on trees at the global and regional scales is still problematic. In some regions such as the temperate and boreal forests, climate change impacts, direct human interventions (including nitrogen-bearing pollution), and the legacy of past human activities (land-use change) appear to be more significant than CO2 fertilization effects. This subject is, however an area of continuing scientific debate, although there does appear to be consensus that any CO2 fertilization effect will saturate (disappear) in the coming century.
   Modeling studies suggest that any warming above current temperatures will diminish crop yields in the tropics while up to 2-3 degrees C of warming in the mid-latitudes may be tolerated by crops, especially if accompanied by increasing precipitation. The preponderance of developing countries lies in or near the tropics; this finding does not bode well for food production in those countries.
   Where direct human pressures do not mask them, there is increasing evidence of the impacts of climate change on forests associated with changes in natural disturbance regimes, growing season length, and local climatic extremes.
   Recent advances in modeling of vegetation response suggest that transient effects associated with dynamically responding ecosystems to climate change will increasingly dominate over the next century and that during these changes the global forest resource is likely to be adversely affected.
   The ability of livestock producers to adapt their herds to the physiological stress of climate change appears encouraging due to a variety of techniques for dealing with climate stress, but this issue is not well constrained, in part because of the general lack of experimentation and simulations of livestock adaptation to climate change.
   Crop and livestock farmers who have sufficient access to capital and technologies should be able to adapt their farming systems to climate change. Substantial changes in their mix of crops and livestock production may be necessary, however, as considerable costs could be involved in this process because investments in learning and gaining experience with different crops or irrigation.
   Impacts of climate change on agriculture after adaptation are estimated to result in small percentage changes in overall global income. Nations with large resource endowments (i.e., developed countries) will fare better in adapting to climate change than those with poor resource endowments (i.e., developing countries and countries in transition, especially in the tropics and subtropics) which will fare worse. This, in turn, could worsen income disparities between developed and developing countries.
   Although local forest ecosystems will be highly affected, with potentially significant local economic impacts, it is believed that, at regional and global scales, the global supply of timber and non-wood goods and services will adapt through changes in the global market place. However, there will be regional shifts in market share associated with changes in forest productivity with climate change: in contrast to the findings of the SAR, recent studies suggest that the changes will favor producers in developing countries, possibly at the expense of temperate and boreal suppliers.
   Global agricultural vulnerability is assessed by the anticipated effects of climate change on food prices. Based on the accumulated evidence of modeling studies, a global temperature rise of greater than 2.5 degrees C is likely to reverse the trend of falling real food prices. This would greatly stress food security in many developing countries.

AB In agrometeorology and management of meteorology related natural resources, many traditional methods and indigenous technologies are still in use or being revived for managing low external inputs sustainable agriculture (LEISA) under conditions of climate variability. This paper starts with the introduction of an "end-to-end" climate information build up and transfer system in agrometeorology, in which the use of such methods and technologies must be seen to operate. It then reviews the options that LEISA farmers have in risk management of agrometeorological and agroclimatological calamities. This is based on the role that the pertinent meteorological/climatological parameters and phenomena play as limiting factors in agricultural production and the expectations on their variability. Subsequently, local case studies are given as examples of preparedness strategies to cope with i). variable water/moisture flows, including mechanical impacts of rain and/or hail, ii). variable temperature and heat flows, including fires, and iii). fitting cropping periods to the varying seasons, everywhere including related phenomena as appropriate. The paper ends with a series of important additional considerations without which the indicated strategies cannot be successful on a larger scale and in the long run.

AB The International Workshop on Reducing Vulnerability of Agriculture and Forestry to Climate Variability and Climate Change held in Ljubljana, Solvenia, from 7 to 9 October 2002 addressed a range of important issues relating to climate variability, climate change, agriculture, and forestry including the state of agriculture and forestry and agrometeological information, and potential adaptation strategies for agriculture and forestry to changing climate conditions and other pressures. There is evidence that global warming over the last millennium has already resulted in increased global average annual temperature and changes in rainfall, with the 1990s being likely the warmest decade in the Northern Hemisphere at least. During the past century, changes in temperature patterns have, for example, had a direct impact on the number of frost days and the length of growing seasons with significant implications for agriculture and forestry. Land cover changes, changes in global ocean circulation and sea surface temperature patterns, and changes in the composition of the global atmosphere are leading to changes in rainfall. These changes may be more pronounced in the tropics. For example, crop varieties grown in the Sahel may not be able to withstand the projected warming trends and will certainly be at risk due to projected lower amounts of rainfall as well. Seasonal to interannual climate forecasts will definitely improve in the future with a better understanding of dynamic relationships. However, the main issue at present is how to make better use of the existing information and dispersion of knowledge to the farm level. Direct participation by the farming communities in pilot projects on agrometeorological services will be essential to determine the actual value of forecasts and to better identify the specific user needs. Old (visits, extension radio) and new (internet) communication techniques, when adapted to local applications, may assist in the dissemination of useful information to the farmers and decision makers. Some farming systems with an inherent resilience may adapt more readily to climate pressures, making long-term adjustments to varying and changing conditions. Other systems will need interventions for adaptation that should be more strongly supported by agrometeorological services for agricultural producers. This applies, among others, to systems where pests and diseases play an important role. Scientists have to guide policy makers in fostering an environment in which adaptation strategies can be effected. There is a clear need for integrating preparedness for climate variability and climate change. In developed countries, a trend of higher yields, but with greater annual fluctuations and changes in cropping patterns and crop calendars can be expected with changing climate scenarios. Shifts in projected cropping patterns can be disruptive to rural societies in general. However, developed countries have the technology to adapt more readily to the projected climate changes. In many developing countries, the present conditions of agriculture and forestry are already marginal, due to degradation of natural resources, the use of inappropriate technologies and other stresses. For these reasons, the ability to adapt will be more difficult in the tropics and subtropics and in countries in transition. Food security will remain a problem in many developing countries.
   Nevertheless, there are many examples of traditional knowledge, indigenous technologies and local innovations that can be used effectively as a foundation for improved frming systems. Before developing adaptation strategies, it is essential to learn from the actual difficulties faced by farmers to cope with risk management at the farm level. Agrometeorologists must play an important role in assisting farmers with the development of feasible strategies to adapt to climate variability and climate change. Agrometeorologists should also advise national policy makers on the urgent need to cope with the vulnerabilities of agriculture and forestry to climate variability and climate change. The workshop recommendations were largely limited to adaptation. Adaptation to the adverse effects of climate variability and climate change is of high priority for nearly all countries, but developing countries are particularly vulnerable. Effective measures to cope with vulnerability and adaptation need to be developed at all levels. Capacity building must be integrated into adaptation measures for sustainable agricultural development strategies. Consequently, nations must develop strategies that effectively focus on specific regional issues to promote sustainable development.

AB Background. The objective of this study was to identify the frequency and characteristics of patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection who had spontaneously achieved viremia below the detection limit of either 400 or 500 copies/mL ( depending on the test used) and to describe the duration of undetectable viremia without antiretroviral therapy ( ART).
   Methods. In the French Agence Nationale de Recherches sur le SIDA SEROCO cohort, 426 patients with HIV seroconversion (i.e., seroconverters) enrolled between 1988 and 1995 had serial measurement of HIV RNA levels during follow-up ( with a cutoff date of 31 December 2002). Factors that distinguished those patients who had spontaneously achieved undetectable viremia (>= 2 consecutive viral loads <400 or <500 copies/mL while not receiving ART) were identified by logistic regression. A Cox model was used to estimate the predictive value of factors related to the duration of undetectable viremia.
   Results. Undetectable viremia had been spontaneously achieved in 36 of 426 seroconverters. Women ( adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.44; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03 - 5.80) and subjects with baseline HIV RNA level <= 3.76 log(10) copies/mL (aOR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.11 - 0.82), baseline HIV DNA level <= 2.61 log(10) copies/mL (aOR, 0.14; 95% CI, 0.04 - 0.44), and high baseline CD4(+) cell count ( aOR, 1.18 for each 100 cells/mm(3); 95% CI, 1.03 - 1.35]) were more likely to have achieved undetectable viremia. The sustainability of this phenomenon ( median duration, 11.9 months; range, 4.6 - 62.8 months) was associated with low baseline HIV DNA and RNA levels.
   Conclusions. Achieving undetectable viremia without ART was not rare, because 6.7% of seroconverters still had a viral load of <400 or <500 copies/mL 5 years after seroconversion. These data should be considered when assessing virologic outcome for patients who interrupt highly active ART initiated during primary infection.

TI Educating for location? The policy context of 'becoming Asia-literate'
   in five western countries/regions in the 1990s
SO COMPARATIVE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID EAST
AB This article examines the educational policy responses by five western countries/ regions to the 'Asian economic miracle' in the 1990s. It begins by stating that the idea of the global economic context has assumed considerable importance in the current educational thinking and debates. It then shows that Asia has been thematized in the west as a challenge that must be accommodated as a matter of significant economic interests. The country/region specific analyses, in the aggregate, demonstrate that 'educating for location' has been the driving force behind the policy to become Asia-literate. This instrumental approach is suggested as having a limiting influence on the sustainability of the policy initiatives. This paper underlies the need for a greater effort to make the proposed literacy reform educationally relevant and valid. Additionally, the recent events of 9/11 and the Bali bombings may have the effect of exacerbating the process.

AB The paper explores the impact of insect-resistant Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) cotton on costs and returns over the first two seasons of its commercial release in three sub-regions of Maharashtra State, India. It is the first such research conducted in India based on farmers' own practices rather than trial plots. Data were collected for a total of 7793 cotton plots in 2002 and 1577 plots in 2003. Results suggest that while the cost of cotton seed was much higher for farmers growing Bt cotton relative to those growing non-Bt cotton, the costs of bollworm spray were much lower. While Bt plots had greater costs (seed plus insecticide) than non-Bt plots, the yields and revenue from Bt plots were much higher than those of non-Bt plots (some 39% and 63% higher in 2002 and 2003, respectively). Overall, the gross margins of Bt plots were some 43% (2002) and 73% (2003) higher than those of non-Bt plots, although there was some variation between the three sub-regions of the state. The results suggest that Bt cotton has provided substantial benefits for farmers in India over the 2 years, but there are questions as to whether these benefits are sustainable.

AB The overall objective of the "Design of a Integrated Ground Water Management System. Application in the aquifer system 08.29 in Mancha Oriental, Spain" project (GESMO), financed by the Spanish government, is to research into new software tools for managing water resources in the agricultural environment. This paper presents a decision support system (DSS) developed within that project. The goal of the system is to assist Eastern Mancha Central Irrigation Board authorities to evaluate water use policies that combine the sustainability of natural resources with regional economic development, which is effectively based on irrigation farming. For this purpose, two different models were integrated within one and the same computer application. One is a hydrogeological model able to simulate the River Jucar basin and its associated aquifer. The other is an econometric model capable of statistically predicting the evolution of the regional crops map, the crop yields and the associated prices, thus allowing for the determination of the regional gross product of crops. A combination of both models can be used to compare the reserve of ground water with the product generated using it as a resource, thus making easier to identify the policies that best combine both factors. The scope of this work is the whole river Jucar aquifer (which is the second largest in surface in Spain) and the lands irrigated by it.
   Functionally, the hydrogeological model is based on finite differences in accordance with the Modular Three-Dimensional Finite-Difference Ground Water Flow (MODFLOW) model developed by the US Geological Survey (USGS), whereas the econometric model is supported by statistical techniques. An important effort have been made in coupling both models as a feedback cycle allowing for a dynamic scenario assessment. Technically, the DSS is conceived as an integrated tool which has been implemented in Visual Basic with a database associated. Its architecture could be translated to other regions without significant programming changes, only introducing new particular parameters into the database. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

DT Article
AB This article is a contribution to reflecting on the relationship among integral sustainability as criterion/goal and sustainable development as a project/process, as well as the process of education (about social values) and learning (knowledge). The author draws on the viewpoint that the process of sustainable development is inherently a process of learning through which one can, if one chooses to, learn to build capacities and capabilities with the aim of living in a more sustainable way. In the first chapter a preliminary analysis of the topic's context is offered on two levels: the level of Croatia, and planetary level. In the second chapter a short discussion is reported, definitions of basic concepts given and axiological origins considered. In the third chapter of the article an overview of general and specific contents of education and learning is given. A proposition of a general curriculum is presented in ten topical "clusters". Without nourishing and learning these general contents and topics, and within them implied values, it is hard to develop an understanding of integral sustainability and sustainable development. Special contents of the curriculum, directly concerning Croatia, are initially presented in a model of three thematic "circles" derived from the analysis of natural resources and environmental specifics of Croatia. These are the following circles: a. "water-soil-food-(environmental) agriculture"; b. "ambiental resources-Karst-biological diversity-development / "environmentalisation" of tourism"; c. "renewable energy resources and their practical affirmation - environmental protection". This article supports the initiation of systematic education and learning for integral sustainability and sustainable development in Croatia and offers an outline of contents which would in the Croatian sociocultural and developmental milieu be historically adequate and up-to-date.

AB Business improvement districts (BIDS) have become popular commercial revitalization tools. To date, the literature has focused on the experiences of large BIDS in the wealthiest parts of the city. The author offers qualitative and quantitative data on 41 of New York City's BIDS in an effort to reveal differences in the form, function, and operating practices of large and small BIDs and the roles they play in urban development processes. Her key findings suggest that large and small BIDs fulfill different development functions. Small BIDS attend to the physical maintenance of an area. Midsized BIDS concentrate on marketing anal promotional activities. Large BIDS, in addition to maintenance and promotion, engage in capital improvement activities. BID behavior appears to vary in relation to its resource base, type of commercial property represented, the composition and balance of power among key stakeholders, and the wealth of the community in which it is located.

DE current account sustainability; capital mobility; threshold effects
ID NUISANCE PARAMETER; HYPOTHESIS
AB We propose an empirical framework that allows us to jointly test for the sustainability of the current account deficit and evaluate the capital mobility thesis by examining the time series properties of the current account. We argue that this approach is more useful than the Feldstein-Horioka (1980) cross-section regression because of its firm basis on the long run inter-temporal budget constraint and of its richer dynamics that allow for a more useful method to evaluate the capital mobility thesis. Based on a century and half of U.S. current account data, we find evidence of current account sustainability and major breaks in the current account dynamics such that adjustment in the current account 'switches off' allowing the current account to accumulate at a non-stationary rate. We assess whether periods in which the current account accumulates in a non-stationary way correspond to historical periods believed to have witnessed high degree of capital mobility.

AB The thermal conductivity and diffusivity of un-fired clay bricks, a straw clay mixture and straw bales have been measured using a thermal probe technique, with an iterative method for data analysis. The steady-state air-to-air thermal transmittance, or U-value, and the time-dependent thermal properties of some proposed. sustainable earth wall constructions are presented. Sustainable cavity walls of un-fired clay bricks with paper, straw or wool cavity insulation have thermal transmittances less than 0.35 W/m(2) K, and therefore meet the current United Kingdom Building Regulations. A review of possible methods for thermally up-grading existing earth walls, by adding an internal insulated timber frame construction, again demonstrates possible compliance with the current UK thermal regulations.

ID DESIGN; PERFORMANCE
AB The application of bioclimatic principles is a critical factor in reducing energy consumption and CO2 emissions of the building sector. This paper develops a regression model of energy efficiency as a function of environmental conditions, building characteristics and passive solar technologies. A sample of 77 bioclimatic buildings (including 45 houses) was collected, covering Greece, other Mediterranean areas and the rest of Europe. Average energy efficiency varied from 19.6 to 100% with an average of about 68%. Environmental conditions included latitude, altitude, ambient temperature, degree days and sun hours; building characteristics consisted in building area and volume. Passive solar technologies included (among others) solar water heaters, shading, natural ventilation, greenhouses and thermal storage walls. Degree days and a dummy variable indicating location in the Mediterranean area were the strongest predictors of energy efficiency while taller and leaner buildings tended to be more energy efficient. Surprisingly, many passive technologies did not appear to make a difference on energy efficiency while thermal storage walls in fact seemed to decrease energy efficiency. The model developed may be of use to architects, engineers and policy makers. Suggestions for further research include obtaining more building information, investigating the effect of passive solar technologies and gathering information on the usage of building.

ID FOURIER-ANALYSIS
AB Presently exploited rates of fossil fuels are expected to deplete resources within the next 40-50 years. and consequently, human beings seek alternative energy resources that are clean. friendly to the environment and sustainable. Accumulation of carbon dioxide in the lower layers of the atmosphere may cause climate change and consequent occurrence of floods, intensive rainfalls and droughts. In order to reduce such dangerous effects all countries have to try to improve their energy resources quality and, if possible, to replace fossil fuels, such as coal, with the renewable alternatives of wind. solar and solar-hydrogen energies. Among these, wind power has a priori significance for Turkey. Wind time series depend very much on meteorological measurements of wind direction and velocity. Unfortunately, in many parts of the world. it is difficult to obtain such data for wind speed time series assessments.
   In this study, harmonic analysis is used to model the daily wind speed values recorded at ten stations in the Marmara region, Turkey, with distinct meteorological conditions from 1993 to 1997. The coefficients. amplitude, variance and phase angle, of each harmonic are calculated for the months of January, April. July and October, leading to total variance maps for spatial interpolations. It is seen that up to the 9th harmonic more than 80 % of the total variance can be presented. The western and eastern parts of the Marmara region have different wind pattern characteristics. The contributions of each harmonic to the total variance are calculated, and then regional variance maps are evaluated. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI The costs of mitigating carbon emissions in China: findings from China

SO ENERGY POLICY
LA English
DT Article
DE carbon emission; reference scenario; marginal abatement cost; GDP
   losses; emission ceiling; MARKAL-MACRO model
AB In this paper MARKAL-MACRO, an integrated energy-environment-economy model, is used to generate China's reference scenario for future energy development and carbon emission through the year 2050. The results show that with great efforts on structure adjustment, energy efficiency improvement and energy substitution, China's primary energy consumption is expected to be 4818 Mtce and carbon emission 2394 MtC by 2050 with annual decrease rate of 3% for the carbon intensity per GDP during the period 2000-2050. On the basis of this reference scenario, China's marginal abatement cost curves of carbon for the year 2010, 2020 and 2030 are derived from the model, and the impacts of carbon emission abatement on GDP are also simulated. The results are compared with those from other sources. The research shows that the marginal abatement costs vary from 12USS/tC to 216USS/tC and the rates of GDP losses relative to reference range from 0.1% to 2.54% for the reduction rates between 5% and 45%. Both the marginal abatement costs and the rates of GDP losses further enlarge on condition that the maximum capacity of nuclear power is constrained to 240GW or 160GW by 2050. The paper concludes that China's costs of carbon abatement is rather high in case of carbon emissions are further cut beyond the reference scenario, and China's carbon abatement room is limited due to her coal-dominant energy resource characteristic. As economic development still remains the priority and per capita income as well as per capita carbon emission are far below the world average, it will be more realistic for China to make continuous contribution to combating global climate change by implementing sustainable development strategy domestically and playing an active role in the international carbon mitigation cooperation mechanisms rather than accepting a carbon emission ceiling.

ID ENERGY-CONSUMPTION; POLLUTION
AB This study analyses the expenditure share of 'clean' and 'dirty' fuels in total cooking fuel consumption for the rural and urban households across 16 major states in India, using household level data from national sample surveys conducted during the period 1983-2000. The results show wide disparity between rural and urban households and also across states. Analysis to identify the determinants of fuel choice reveals that affordability plays a major role, while the pro-rich and pro-urban bias of kerosene supply through public distribution system also has influenced the observed variation in consumption patterns across states and over rural and urban areas. The study discusses the policies that could facilitate switch towards 'clean' fuels and argues that enabling policies should pay attention among other things to the gender issues and trade-offs that exist between say, local and global pollution, deforestation and resource depletion, and disease and subsidy burden.

AB Malaysia is endowed with abundant supplies of non-renewable energy resources, especially oil and gas. However, its current oil and gas reserves are expected to be depleted within 17 and 37 years, respectively. With the future prospect of energy prices likely to soar when the level of use of these non-renewable fossil fuel resources exceeds their threshold capacity, there is an urgent need for Malaysia to optimize the use of its huge quantities of palm oil biomass wastes as a renewable energy source. Against this background, this article aims to empirically and quantitatively analyze the potential of recovering renewable energy from palm oil wastes, which contributes substantially to harnessing a sustainable resource management system in Malaysia.

ID BIOMASS
AB According to some projections, Turkey's primary energy demand is expected to increase four times its 1998 value in the next 20 years. Turkish gas demand is expected to increase more than five folds in 2010 and eight times in 2020. Supplies of fossil and nuclear sources are generally acknowledged to be finite; non-fossil energy sources, such as nuclear, hydropower, biomass, solar and wind, are generally considered renewable and therefore sustainable over the relative long term. Turkey plans to increase hydropower production in the near future. The sharp growth of the energy sector has been accompanied by institutional reforms. One of the most important developments has been liberalization of all energy sectors, including electricity production and distribution, to private capital both national and foreign. Turkey possesses a relatively high abundance of hydropower, geothermal energy, biomass, moderate wind speeds and solar radiation, and nuclear energy resources. Renewable environmentally friendly energy must be encouraged, promoted, implemented and demonstrated for use in Turkey.

AB Differences in stakeholders' perceptions, lack of commitment, unused knowledge, and interfering, ineffective, measures are just some of the problems encountered in sustainable urban development projects. Collaborative decisionmaking approaches tackle these problems by creating a shared understanding of the problems faced and of ways to address them. The authors explore how the combined application of two techniques, a decision-support tool and a simulation game, can support decisionmaking for sustainable urban development. The techniques are applied in decisionmaking for real and in fictional sustainable urban renewal projects. Benefits and challenges of this combined approach are discussed based on experiences in seven applications. The main finding is that the use of the decision-support tool combined with the simulation-gaming procedure can support agenda setting and help create a shared understanding of problems and potential solutions in the field of sustainable urban renewal.

AB This review examines the development and application of strategic environmental assessment (SEA) process in the planning framework of Hong Kong. Two strategic planning case studies are evaluated within the context of SEA, namely the Territorial Development Strategy Review (TDS Review) and the Third Comprehensive Transport Study (CTS-3). Rapid population growth and urbanisation in Hong Kong, coupled with a historic lack of planning controls and inherent conflicts between government departments have been major obstacles to achieving sustainable development in the territory. Despite these challenges, Hong Kong was one of the first Asian countries to apply SEA to major development plans, where the implementation of the 'SUSDEV 21' study on sustainable development has demonstrated the governments commitment towards integrated environmental protection. The application of SEA has provided decision-makers with key information on potential environment impacts arising from proposed developments, resulting in greater accountability and transparency in the decision-making process. SEA in Hong Kong has also prompted an increased level of environmental awareness and co-operation between government departments and agencies responsible for the management of Hong Kong's natural and urban environments. However, the application of SEA in Hong Kong continues to have notable limitations. SEA needs to evolve beyond its current sectoral application to examine ways in which development decisions can not only pre-empt and prevent environmental damage, but also positively enhance and restore existing natural resources. Current land use plans and transportation strategies still largely determine the pattern of development in the near future without adequate longer-term environmental cost-benefit analysis. Sustainable development includes environmental, social and economic considerations, and these inter-related elements need be suitably balanced. SEA is not a means to obstruct development in Hong Kong, but should be recognised for its inherent socio-economic and ecological value, and fully integrated with the decision-making process. Whilst it is admirable that Hong Kong has taken positive steps in this direction, it is now an opportune moment for the government to have the foresialit and tenacity to create a sustainable development framework for Hong Kong into the future.

AB Based on interval grey number theory, a grey numerical model was developed to simulate groundwater flow in two-dimensional porous-medium aquifer. The solution method proposed in this paper ensures the integrity and validity of the grey data transportation in the calculation processes. Because most of the parameters characterizing groundwater flow are of grey nature, a grey model can better describe the groundwater flow than the traditional "white" model. The method was applied to evaluate the sustainable groundwater resource in a groundwater basin of north China. The results from the case study help develop the most appropriate approaches to utilize the water resources in the area.

AB This paper presents a method for the feasibility of an artificial recharge scheme in a limestone aquifer. A 3D digital groundwater flow model was developed and calibrated to gain a better understanding of the aquifer dynamics and to estimate its capacity for artificial recharge. Several scenarios, based on different pumping alternatives, were tested over a 30 year period. The results were then analysed by yearly input-output balances. Worst case scenario model output suggests that implementing the scheme might ensure a sustainable use of the aquifer in the future.

AB The current trend of industrialization and urbanization in developing nations has a huge impact on anthropogenic and natural ecosystems. Pollution sources increase with the expansion of cities and cause contamination of water, air and soil. The absence of urban environmental planning and management strategies has resulted in greater concern for future urban development. This paper advocates the adoption of strategic environmental assessment (SEA) as a means to achieve sustainable development in developing countries. It investigates project-level environmental impact assessment (EIA) and its limitations. The exploration of SEA and its features are addressed. The effective implementation of SEA can create a roadmap for sustainable development. In many developing countries, the lack of transparency and accountability and ineffective public participation in the development of the policy, plan and program (PPP) would be mitigated by the SEA process. Moreover, the proactive and broadly based characteristics of SEA would benefit the institutional development of the PPP process, which is rarely experienced in many developing countries. The paper also explores the prospects for SEA and its guiding principles in developing countries. Finally, the paper calls for a coordinated effort between all government, nongovernment and international organizations involved with PPPs to enable developing countries to pursue a path of sustainable development through the development and application of strategic environmental assessment.

AB In a number of recent research projects, computer models have been included in participatory procedures to assess global environmental change. The intention was to support knowledge production and to help the involved non-scientists to develop a deeper understanding of the interactions between natural and social systems. This paper analyses the experiences made in three projects with the use of computer models from a participatory and a risk management perspective. Our cross-cutting analysis of the objectives, the employed project designs and moderation schemes and the observed learning processes in participatory processes with model use shows that models play a mixed role in informing participants and stimulating discussions. However, no deeper reflection on values and belief systems could be achieved. In terms of the risk management phases, computer models serve best the purposes of problem definition and option assessment within participatory integrated assessment (PIA) processes.

AB The construction of the Almaraz nuclear power plant in Spain in the 1970s posed interesting environmental problems concerning the construction of a cooling reservoir (Arrocampo reservoir) to cool the steam condensers and the consequent heating of the reservoir's water. The socio-political context forced decision makers to set up a project for the monitoring and management of the environmental impacts derived from the construction and operation of the power plant. Numerous scientific and technical specialists collaborated with the representatives of social groups towards two goals: the improvement of the biodiversity and of the efficiency of the cooling system. These goals involved the monitoring and managing of the system with respect to different biological aspects, mainly limnology, ichthyology, avian fauna and vegetation. The management plan yielded numerous results. The control of the water eutrophy is one of the most important due to its repercussion on the rest of the ecosystem, especially the fish fauna. The development of the shore vegetation slowly increased the patchwork nature of the reservoir, leading to a greater diversity of the avian species. This paper describes the monitoring and management of the Arrocampo ecosystem, the condition before and after the construction of the reservoir and the results obtained concerning some biological communities.

AB Industrial production imposes geographical, economic and cultural distances between producers and consumers. The concept of constituting 'missing objects' can help shrink these distances by enabling actors to engage in discourses and practices about contexts beyond what is materially present. Since the mid-1990s, food miles have emerged as an example of missing objects, representing the distance that agricultural products travel from the farm to the dining table, and the environmental effects of transportation. I analyse how consumers, farmers, activists, industry and policy-makers in the United States and Europe are building agency in making and using food miles.

AB The capital approach is frequently used to model sustainability. A development is deemed to be sustainable when capital is not reduced. There are different definitions of sustainability, based on whether or not they allow that different forms of capital may be substituted for each other. A development that allows for the substitution of different forms of capital is called weakly sustainable. This article shows that in a risky world and a risk-averse society even under the assumptions of weak sustainability the circumstances under which different forms of capital may be substituted are limited. This is due to the risk-reducing effect of diversification. Using Modern Portfolio Theory this article shows under which conditions substitution of different forms of capital increases risk for future generations.

AB East Africa has a rich coral fauna that extends to Maputaland in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. At this latitude, considered high and marginal for coral distribution and development, they form a veneer on limited, late Pleistocene reefs rather than forming the accretive, aragonite structures known as coral reefs. It is thus more appropriate to refer to them in this region as coral communities, the environment being rendered marginal for their development by reduced temperatures, light and aragonite saturation state. Subsequent to their discovery, the reefs were afforded protection within two Marine Protected Areas (the St Lucia and Maputaland Marine Reserves). They are found primarily within three reef complexes, with only the central complex being readily accessible to the public for ecotourism at present. With the creation of the Greater St Lucia Wetland Park, a World Heritage Site, and the expectation of an accompanying increase in ecotourism, the status quo seems set to change. The reefs are thus the current focus of a modelling initiative to provide decision support in their management. This paper examines the unique nature of the South African communities, their vulnerability and importance in the regional and global context, and, using representative data from the model, how an anticipated increase in their use could affect their sustainability. The case for scientifically based zonation for their use is presented. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study examines the process by which a program becomes sustainable. In health promotion, sustainability is usually modeled as the final stage of a program's evolution. In practice, however, this stage model appears deceiving. This article proposes that processes for implementing programs and for ensuring their sustainability are concomitant. Using a multiple-case study methodology, we examined routinization-the sustainability process in organizations-of the Quebec Heart Health Demonstration Project in five community health centers over 10 years. Data came from documents and interviews. The analysis considered themes using the Critical Incident Technique. Our results suggest routinization-related events occurred as soon as the project began, and the occurrence of specific routinization events foresaw the presence of program-related routines. These events were concomitant with those associated with implementation. This supports the proposition. It suggests health promoters should consider program sustainability from the very beginning, and can take inspiration from the events presented herein when looking for ways to influence the sustainability of their programs.

AB Using lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) and walleye (Sander vitreits) we examined the extent of error that is created when nonpopulation-specific or non-sex-specific data are used to develop fishery sustainability models. To put biases in perspective we first compared relative differences in sustainable harvest rate estimates of fast and slow growing populations to the mean difference between species. Few estimates of early mortality exist for either species, and a sensitivity analysis indicated that sustainable harvest rate estimates varied by more than 90% with those available. To evaluate biases created by predicting life history traits we estimated maturation age from asymptotic length in populations whose life history parameters had been measured directly. Incorporating species-specific information produced maturation ages that were closer to those measured (mean difference 22%) than did the estimates from inter-specific relationships (mean difference 42%). This resulted in sustainability estimates from species-specific predictions being closer to those estimated using actual maturation data. In evaluating problems associated with using non-sex-specific data we found that estimates of maximum sustainable harvest rates increased when female-specific life history data were used (could only be done for walleye) instead of combined-sex data (mean change in the two populations was 7%). Analyses indicate that it is desirable to collect life history data on specific populations of lake trout and walleye. If this is not possible, estimates of maximum sustainable harvest rates are most influenced by variation in estimates of early mortality, followed by the taxonomic resolution used to estimate co-variation among life history traits, and finally the use of combined-sex versus female-specific data.

AB Concerns of inaccuracy or bias associated with current techniques used to obtain age and growth data for abalone (age from shell layers, growth from tag-recapture, modal progression) have prompted consideration of alternative techniques to obtain data to ensure sustainable management of abalone fisheries. Stable oxygen isotopes have been used in many studies of molluscan age and growth, but to date this technique has not been applied to haliotids. Here we describe the procedure as applied to the blacklip abalone Haliotis rubra in south-east Tasmania. Stable oxygen isotope ratios of serial samples from calcium carbonate collected at approximately 1-4, mm intervals along the growth direction of the shell reflected the seasonal temperature cycle. From these oscillations, estimates of age and growth were obtained for two specimens, shell length 63.6 and 87.2 mm. We determined the age of these specimens to be 3.5 and 5 years. Growth rates ranged between 13 and 19 mm year(-1). This study demonstrates the potential of stable oxygen isotopes to validate existing techniques used to determine age and growth of abalone, and could provide further insights into age and growth processes of haliotids.

DE idea marketing in forestry; product mix; marketable values in forestry
AB Marketing has been defined as business activities that direct the flow of goods and services from producer to consumer. Earlier definitions tended to describe marketing in strictly economic terms. However, in later definitions marketing deals not only with business activities but also with transactions, which are exchanges of values between two parties. Marketed products or goods in recent marketing definitions are things that have value to people that may include consumers, users or clients. On the other hand, forestry product mix has also evolved in time. In this study, forestry values, both marketable and nonmarketable, have been examined for the forestry sector according to recent marketing definitions. Forestry values such as resource sustainability, ecological and social responsibilities have been argued as marketable ideas. Turkish forestry is introduced briefly. The importance of idea marketing is explained and some results of marketing being restricted only to economic goods are introduced using examples from Turkish forestry. (c) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

DE world forests; plantations; management; protection; certification;
   ownership; sustainable forest management
AB Data are reviewed on the extent of global forests, management, protection, certification and ownership, as well as implications for sustainable forest management as defined by the Montreal Process criteria. According to FAO, as of 2000, the world had 3.9 billion hectares (ha) of forests with 187 million ha (5%) in forest plantations. Drawing on additional surveys and our research, we estimate that there were approximately 204 million ha of planted forests as of 2002. Public ownership comprised 87% of the world's total forest area, with the US having the largest share of privately owned forests and almost all forests in Africa being publicly owned. Approximately 1.7 billion ha of forests (43%) were reported to be covered by forest management plans, and 477 million ha (12%) were under fonnal forest protection decrees or laws. However, the degree of management intensity and forest protection actually realized by these reported data is moot. Forest certification includes 121 million ha (3%) of forests, with 93% of the certification occurring in the Northern Hemisphere, but most of the deforestation occurring in the Southern, Hemisphere. The data provide evidence that many countries in the world are trying to achieve sustainable forest management, and certainly are trying to report data that suggest that they are moving toward sustainable forest management goals. The empirical evidence that forests are actually well managed and protected, however, is often lacking. Enhanced sustainable forest management will require better reporting and verification, more areas covered and enhanced implementation of sustainable forest management criteria and indicators in the future.

   forest policy
AB The 1990s heralded a new era in forest policy in Australia with the introduction of The National Forest Policy Statement which provided a framework under which native forest resources would be protected whilst also permitting ecologically sustainable timber harvesting. However, the implementation of the statement through the Regional Forest Agreements by state governments appear to contradict the conditions of the policy. Political bias towards development imperatives in implementing RFAs is evident. Community involvement in RFAs has not been satisfactory for sustainable forest use and management, with ongoing dissatisfaction from some stakeholder groups. There is still increased demand for protection of what remains of the various forest reserves. Aboriginal issues have not been settled in line with the expectation of the policy. There are continuing conflicts between the Commonwealth Government and some state governments. (c) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Previous to the introduction of sustainable forest management principles, PC-based modelling techniques had been developed for the financial optimisation of forest-level harvest scheduling under Irish conditions. These financial models were further developed to produce a Mixed Integer Prograrnming-Sustainable Forest Management (MIP-SFM) model, in which principles of sustainable forest management were incorporated into the harvest scheduling process. The effectiveness and practicality of the harvest schedules produced by the financial model and the MIP-SFM model were compared to the harvest schedules produced by the process currently employed by Coillte (The Irish Forestry Board). Evaluation of the models was carried out in Clonbrock forest (294.8 ha), a typical Irish plantation forest, owned and managed by Coillte. The MIP-SFM model produced effective and practical harvest schedules that enhanced the sustainability of Clonbrock forest by incorporating environmental, ecological and social management parameters. The application of the developed MIP-SFM inodel resulted in an increase in NPV of 5.7% compared to the NPV produced by the scheduling process currently employed by Coillte. The application of the financial model had resulted in a comparable increase in NPV of 14.2%. The smaller increase in NPV produced by the MIP-SFM model provided ail indication of the cost associated with the introduction of environmental, ecological and social SFM principles in the management of Clonbrock forest. &COPY; 2004 Elsevier B.V.

TI Approaches in Great Britain and Ireland to the genetic improvement of

CT Conference onGenetic Improvement of Broadleaved Trees
CY MAR, 2004

SP Royal Forestry Soc England, Royal Forestry Soc Wales, Royal Forestry Soc NE Ireland
AB The history of broadleaved tree improvement since 1945 in Great Britain and Ireland is outlined in this paper, covering provenance trials, seed stands, phenotypic selection, progeny trials, seed orchards and vegetative propagation. The long-term nature of any broadleaved programme has led to reluctance to start projects, and much of what was funded in the mid-1900s has since been lost through spending cuts and 'rationalizations'. Most resources were, and still are, devoted to conifers, particularly Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr.). Since the 1980s, broadleaved planting has increased enormously, currently amounting to two-thirds of all new planting in Britain, yet attitudes towards growing high-quality broadleaved trees for timber have hardly changed. Conservation, landscape and amenity values are placed far higher than quality. Nevertheless some progress with genetic improvement has been made from the 1990s with seven species through the British and Irish Hardwoods Improvement Programme - an informal, but apparently effective, voluntary association of landowners, nursery managers, research institutions, universities and professional foresters. It is concluded that inadequate investment in genetic research and weak management of projects potentially undermines all aspects of sustainable forestry and hampers the delivery of forestry policies; most notably, it limits the potential for the production of high-quality hardwood timber.

AB This paper discusses challenges of an educational program, where interdisciplinarity is an important ambition. A theoretical perspective on interdisciplinarity must be more than adding insights from different disciplines as surprisingly many actors still take it to be. Interdisciplinarity is a fruitful meeting-ground and constitute processes for translation and integration of disciplinary perspectives. Interdisciplinary candidates must learn and should develop skills to identify select, translate and integrate knowledge from different disciplines into a coherent framework. From theories in interdisciplinarity, one should develop explicit theories for interdisciplinarity. A common field focus can motivate integration of and translation between disciplines. The multipurpose re-orientation in forestry as an example of natural resource management displays the need for development of management proficiency not only related to multipurpose management, but also to handle social issues and interactions between conflicting actors. Within forestry, interdisciplinary challenges are often met through implicit, tacit and experience-based "common sense" knowledge. An explicit focus on integration of and translation between disciplines as well as development of experience-based skills is required to build interdisciplinary proficiency. This includes using practical field assignments and problem-based learning approaches to develop candidates ' abilities to select, translate and integrate knowledge.

AB An institutional consortium has been formed in the Amazon to implement collaborative programs to reverse resource degradation through sustainable land use systems. The Amazon Initiative (AI) Consortium for Conservation and Sustainable Use of Natural Resources was created in mid-2003 and formalized in 2004 by the National Agricultural Research Institutions of Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela, together with four centers of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research: CIAT, CIFOR, ICRAF, and IPGRI. Associate institutions include regional research centers and universities. Consortium partners are creating an inter-institutional and interdisciplinary team, which will function as a "distributed network" of scientists, working at different sites in the Amazon. Under this arrangement, the Amazon Initiative will create conditions for institutional articulation and strengthen analytical skills to identify priorities for research and development intervention. In addition, the AI will develop methodological tools and information communication mechanisms to enhance the role of local agents for the sustainable development of their regions. In doing so, the AI will contribute to enhancing living conditions of traditional populations and smallholders in the region, while effectively contributing to integrated natural resource management and conservation efforts in sites highly exposed to development pressures in six Amazonian countries.

AB One of the big challenges of research in support of sustainable forest management (SFM) is the need for increased collaboration of researchers from different academic disciplines. The Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) Network ' s approach to interdisciplinary research has evolved over the past ten years. One of the most significant changes has been a shift to larger and more integrated project teams. Increased integration in research in the SFM Network has resulted in benefits, particularly in relation to Canadds capacity to address SFM-related research questions and management issues.

AB Cocoa-producing countries of West and Central Africa experienced a serious economic crisis in the early 1980s, when the cocoa sector was liberalized and the macroeconomic policies of the sector changed. These institutional changes created new difficulties and challenges for sustainable cocoa farming. Farmers in this region have recently turned to timber and non-timber production to offset the fluctuation of cocoa prices. In a survey of 300 cocoa farmers in the humid forest zone of Southern Cameroon, pest and disease outbreaks were identified as the major limiting factors to sustainable cocoa production. An analysis of pests and diseases affecting the cocoa plantations in the humid forest zone of West and Central Africa revealed strong links to the type of forest cover found on or near the cocoa plantation. An integrated approach to pest management is proposed and the paper concludes with a discussion of current efforts to address constraints posed by pests and diseases on sustainable cocoa farming in the four main cocoa-producing countries of West and Central Africa.

AB The evolution of forest values from timber supply to ecological and social values has been leading to the redefinition of the Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) paradigm. In parallel, scientific knowledge is expanding and uncovering the interconnectedness of the various processes that support these values. We thus have many wishes and much knowledge but we have to ensure that we have the decision support tools that will pull them together to promote SFM. After a broad review of the evolution of decision support tools in forest managernerit, this paper presents a case for more holistic numerical planning tools. To illustrate that such tools can be designed, we propose a simple decentralized approach. In this approach, a landscape management strategy evolves based on local decisions, integrating spatial and aspatial, multi-period and period-specific goals. Such tools could become a useful platform for sustainable forest management planning.

AB Borrowing from landscape ecology, atmospheric science, and integrated assessment, we aim to understand the complex interactions that determine productivity in montane forests and utilize such relationships to forecast montane forest vulnerability under global climate change. Specifically, we identify, relationships for precipitation and temperature that govern the spatiotemporal variability in Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) growth by seeking similarities in patterns of growth/climate models across a significant portion of the climatological range of the species. In the 21(st) century and beyond, sustainable forestry will depend on successful adaptation to the impacts of climate change and climate variability on forest structure and function. The combination of these foci will allow improved prediction of the fate of montane forests over a wide range of biogeoclimatic conditions in western North America and thus allow improved management strategies for adapting to climate change. We describe a multi-disciplinary strategy for analyzing growth variability as a function of climate over a broad range of local-to-regional influences and demonstrate the efficacy of this sampling method in defining regional gradients of growth-limiting factors.

AB Interdisciplinary planning and evaluation of forest management is necessary for sustainable forest management (SFM) schemes involving multiple values of multi-stakeholders. Often, multi-objective forest-planning and evaluation encounter complexity and uncertainty due to "inexactness" - i.e., fuzziness, ambiguity, imprecision and variability - of spatial behaviours of ecological and human systems. This paper develops the possibility schema - from fuzzy sets and theory of possibility - for representation and evaluation of inexact spatial concepts, configurations, and processes, associated with forest ecosystem and stakeholder values. A hypothetical case of interdisciplinary research utilizing criteria and indicators of SFM is used to illustrate the utility of the proposed possibility schema in interdisciplinary forest decision-making. The schema can be used for ex-antc appraisal and ex-post evaluation of forest programs. It can also be used for intearation of interdisciplinary forest knowledge, including ecological and socio-economic models of SFM.

AB This article discusses collaborative research with the Office of the Wet ' suwet ' en Nation on their traditional territories in north-central British Columbia, Canada, a forest-dependent region where contemporary and traditional forest resources management regimes overlap. In-depth personal interviews with the hereditary chiefs and concept mapping were used to identify, social-ecological linkages in Wet ' suwet ' en culture to inform the development of culturally sensitive social criteria and indicators of sustainable forest management (SFM) in this region. The preliminary results demonstrate how the CatPac II software tool can be applied to identify key component concepts and linkages in local definitions of SFM, and translate large volumes of (oral) qualitative data into manageable information resources for forest managers and decision-makers.

AB A spatially explicit understanding of local knowledge about land use and tenure is fundamental to developing and assessing sustainable management options for tropical forests in Central Africa. This paper presents a case study in the Humid Forest Zone of Cameroon to demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating participatory rural appraisal techniques with remote sensing and vegetation mapping in a geographic information system (GIS) environment.

ID PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT; NEWFOUNDLAND; POLICY
AB With the introduction of the concept of sustainable forest management, the practice of public participation has become omnipresent. This study focuses on provincial participatory requirements in forest management planning (FMP). A comparative framework composed of four participatory process attributes (power, moment of participation, learning/interaction, and procedure) was used to obtain a temporal and interprovincial perspective of Quebec's new participatory process. Our results indicate that with respect to past processes Quebec ' s current approach allows certain stakeholders, but not the general public, to have more access to FMP. Comparatively, Ontario and Newfoundland have implemented different, clearly stated, approaches that involve the general public at numerous stages of FMP. Future research should concentrate on how these participatory requirements are implemented and on the public satisfaction with regard to this implementation.

AB This paper discusses the use of a deliberative approach to governance of environmental resources at the local-level. Used in conjunction with external facilitation, a deliberative approach to governance at the local-level can be used to build dialogue between diverse perspectives, interests, knowledge, and ideas of different stakeholders. A case study of a community forest user group (CFUG) in the central hills of Nepal is used to analyse the application of deliberative processes for prornotinga deliberative governance. The findings indicate that there is great potential for deliberative processes to make local governance of community forests more democratic and inclusive. Effective governance at the local-level can contribute to the creation of social equity and to the sustainable managernent of community forests.

AB D. Meadows considered in his report 'limits of growth' the financial system as a neutral accounting system and came to a pessimistic view. But the money-system itself creates several side effects and distorts our economic system right from the beginning. The money-system is not neutral. New scenario modelings considering the financial system can come to a positive perspective. Three from six systematically developed scenarios include paths to different kinds of sustainability. From a systemic view, the combination of conventional and complementary solutions can provide a substantial contribution towards a sustainable future. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The mosquito Aedes aegypti is the most important vector of yellow fever and dengue fever flaviviruses. Ae. aegypti eradication campaigns have not been sustainable and there are no effective vaccines for dengue viruses. Alternative control strategies may depend upon identification of mosquito genes that condition flavivirus susceptibility and may ultimately provide clues for interrupting transmission. Quantitative trait loci affecting the ability of Ae. aegypti to develop a dengue-2 infection in the midgut have been mapped previously. Herein we report on QTL that determine whether mosquitoes with a dengue-2-infected gut can then disseminate the virus to other tissues. A strain selected for high rates of dengue-2 dissemination was crossed to a strain selected for low dissemination rates. QTL were mapped in the F-2 and again in an F-5 advanced intercross line. QTL were detected at 31 cM on chromosome 1, at 32 cM on chromosome II, and between 44 and 52 cM on chromosome III. Alleles at these QTL were additive or dominant in determining rates of dengue-2 dissemination and accounted for similar to 45% of the phenotypic variance. The locations of dengue-2 midgut infection and dissemination QTL correspond to those found in earlier studies.

AB Thick loess deposits consisting of paleosol sequences comprise the deep regolith of the Palouse region in eastern Washington and northern Idaho. Ground water is the principal water supply for the Palouse Basin, yet recharge mechanisms and rates through this regolith are poorly understood. Forecasting the sustainability of the water supply has been hampered because models that predict ground-water recharge are complicated by deep regolith that has complex stratigraphy and, in some instances, multiple buried hydraulically restrictive horizons. To assess water movement, pore-water Cl- and delta O-18 distributions were measured to 6-m depths in three catchments representing a climosequence across the Basin, and interpreted using catchment and basin-wide stratigraphic relationships. Vertical facies between dense and soft horizons coincide with variations in [Cl-]. In the eastern Basin, pore-water [Cl-] ranged from 15 to 150 mg/L and increased with depth. In addition, shifts in isotopic signature of oxygen in pore water coincide with Cl-rich horizons, and suggest long pore-water residence times. In contrast, [Cl-] in the central and western Basin ranges from I to 15 mg/L and changes little with depth. Tracer profiles illustrate three major hydrostratigraphic units in the Basin: (1) uplands with relatively homogeneous regolith that has short pore-water residence times; (2) uplands with heterogeneous regolith that has long pore-water residence times; and (3) valleys with heterogeneous regolith that display dynamic hydraulic processes. Regional relationships between deep regolith and surface soils were established in order to use the SSURGO database to estimate the spatial extent of each hydrostratigraphic unit. The degree of paleosol development mimics that of contemporary sola across the climosequence. Results indicate that recharge is less than 3 turn year(-1) in 33% of the study area where precipitation is greatest and regolith is heterogeneous. Recharge increases to 10 min year(-1) in 37% of the study area where regolith is homogeneous. Valley positions having active hydraulic regimes constitute 10% of the Basin. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB Sustainable use of groundwater must ensure not only that the future resource is not threatened by overuse, but also that natural environments that depend on the resource, such as stream baseflows, riparian vegetation, aquatic ecosystems, and wetlands are protected. To properly manage groundwater resources, accurate information about the inputs (recharge) and outputs (pumpage and natural discharge) within each groundwater basin is needed so that the long-term behavior of the aquifer and its sustainable yield can be estimated or reassessed. As a first step towards this effort, this work highlights some key groundwater recharge studies in the Kansas High Plains at different scales, such as regional soil-water budget and groundwater modeling studies, county-scale groundwater recharge studies, as well as field-experimental local studies, including some original new findings, with an emphasis on assumptions and limitations as well as on environmental factors affecting recharge processes. The general impact of irrigation and cultivation on recharge is to appreciably increase the amount of recharge, and in many cases to exceed precipitation as the predominant source of recharge. The imbalance between the water input (recharge) to the High Plains aquifer and the output (pumpage and stream baseflows primarily) is shown to be severe, and responses to stabilize the system by reducing water use, increasing irrigation efficiency, adopting water-saving land-use practices, and other measures are outlined. Finally, the basic steps necessary to move towards sustainable use of groundwater in the High Plains are delineated, such as improving the knowledge base, reporting and providing access to information, furthering public education, as well as promoting better understanding of the public's attitudinal motivations; adopting the ecosystem and adaptive management approaches to managing groundwater; further improving water efficiency; exploiting the full potential of dryland and biosaline agriculture; and adopting a goal of long-term sustainable use.

AB Simulation and empirical analyses were conducted to evaluate the utility and robustness of average length (Lbar) of animals in the exploited population as an estimator of fishing mortality (F), and therefore as an indicator of exploitation status for Florida coral-reef fish. Simulation results showed that the Lbar estimator of fishing mortality was relatively insensitive to trends in recruitment, and demonstrated favourable proper-ties for detecting statistical differences between sustainable and non-sustainable rates of exploitation. Rates of F estimated from fishery-dependent size composition data were comparable to F estimates from catch-and-effort time-series. Average length was also estimated from fishery-independent diver surveys for 22 species in the exploited snapper-grouper complex. A majority of snapper-grouper species are currently fished unsustainably in the Florida Keys, though overfishing appears most severe for long-lived, slow-growing fish.

AB We consider the potential for using prices as leading indicators of changes in stocks and yields in the freshwater capture fishery in Lake Victoria. Fertilizer run-off from agricultural land is a major cause of nutrient loading, along with soil erosion, atmospheric deposition, and point pollution from industrial and domestic affluent. The interactions between fertilizer applications, water quality, fish stocks, and yields are modelled in order to predict the effect of changes in the price of fertilizers on the fishery. The fishery model includes a measure of Chl a concentration (a proxy for phytoplankton density). The consequences of changes in Chl a concentration for fish stocks are modelled using Ecopath. We show that fertilizer prices are effective leading indicators of changes in fish biomass and yield. (c) 2005 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Few indicators exist that measure the effects of fishing at the whole-ecosystem level. A 4D ecosystem exploitation index is proposed that integrates four measures of ecosystem status: (i) the trophic balance of exploitation, (ii) the intensity of exploitation, (iii) species richness, and (iv) disturbance of the trophic structure. The central concept is that fisheries should extract yield in proportion to the productivity at each trophic level, at sustainable exploitation rates, with minimal disturbance to the trophic structure, and with no loss in species richness. The ecosystem exploitation index is tested on simulated ecosystem data and applied to data from the eastern Scotian Shelf, Canada. The model simulations provided consistent results that should facilitate cross-system comparisons of exploitation and ecosystem status. When applied to actual observations, the results were less coherent, likely attributable to lag effects and environmental impacts. All fisheries likely alter the trophic structure of ecosystems, and the rate and trophic pattern of exploitation determines the level of change. Exploiting all trophic levels equally would always result in less change to trophic structure than top-heavy exploitation. Further testing is required to determine lag effects and sensitivity to various assumptions.

AB Ecosim models have been fitted to time-series data for a wide variety of ecosystems for which there are long-term data that confirm the models' ability to reproduce past responses of many species to harvesting. We subject these model ecosystems to a variety of harvest policies, including options based on harvesting each species at its maximum sustainable yield (MSY) fishing rate. We show that widespread application of single-species MSY policies would in general cause severe deterioration in ecosystem structure, in particular the loss of top predator species. This supports the long-established practice in fisheries management of protecting at least some smaller "forage" species specifically for their value in supporting larger piscivores.

AB Maintenance of overall ecosystem complexity is perceived as critical to the sustainability of ecosystem use. The development of an operational basis for an ecosystem approach to fisheries, however, faces many difficulties. On the research side, the challenge is in defining proper long-term, ecosystem-related objectives; determining meaningful reference values and indicators for desirable or undesirable states of the ecosystem; and developing appropriate data collection, analytical tools and models. The "viability" concept developed in economics by Jean-Pierre Aubin can be used to assist in the definition, selection of, and interaction among long-term objectives at an ecosystem level. It recognizes that ecosystems are complex assemblages of interacting and self-organizing natural and human components that cannot be predicted. Viability models define an ensemble of "viable states", in contrast to undesirable states defined as such by ecological, economic, and/or social constraints. These constraints can be derived from fisheries objectives, conservation principles, scientific results of modelling, or precautionary principles, and correspond to limit reference points to be avoided. Viability theory does not attempt to choose any "optimal solution" according to given criteria, but selects "viable evolutions". These evolutions are compatible with the constraints in the sense that they satisfy them at each time and can be delineated by the viability kernel. The southern Benguela marine ecosystem is presented as a first attempt for the application of this theory. In defining ecosystem-based objectives (and related issues such as target reference points), it seems more difficult to reach consensus among stakeholders on what is desirable than on what is undesirable (e.g. biological or economic collapse, species extinction, displacement of local rural communities). Expressed in the negative form or as limit reference points, ecosystem-based constraints can be considered simultaneously with current target reference points, such as maximum sustainable yield, using viability models. The viability approach can help to progressively integrate ecosystem considerations, such as conservation, into fisheries management. (c) 2004 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

AB A composite quantitative index for the percentage of primary production required to sustain fisheries and the average trophic, level of catch (%PPR-TLc) was employed to develop ecosystem-based reference functions suitable for fisheries management. Established ecosystem models, characterized by pairs of %PPR-TLc, were classified as either sustainably exploited or ecosystem overfished, on the basis of the results of factorial correspondence analysis applied to selected ecological indices, and on information from various sources. Canonical discriminant analysis of these pairs was applied to establish the discriminant function to separate the two exploitation classes. Next, reference functions related to different probabilities of ecosystem overfishing were developed to obtain an operational framework for ecosystem-based fisheries management. Values of ecosystem-based maximum sustainable catches associated with different probabilities of belonging to a sustainable situation were calculated. Overall, results show that most current fishing scenarios entail high risks of ecosystem overfishing.

AB This paper presents the results of an empirical analysis of the determinants of e-business activity across a sample of 26 developed countries and 52 emerging markets. Several "e-readiness" indicators predict actual e-business activity, including Internet infrastructure, computer infrastructure, affordable telephone service, literacy rates, English language capabilities, and logistics infrastructure. No support was found for a linkage between e-business and institutional factors (i.e., country risk, economic freedom, and transparency) or payment infrastructure. Moreover, evidence of path dependence suggests that sustainable first-mover advantages are. conveyed upon early adopters of Internet technologies. Important regional differences also exist, with Asia leading other emerging markets and Eastern Europe lagging. Finally, analysis of a subsample of countries suggests that entrepreneurship rates drive e-business activity. The results document the persistence of the global digital divide and support a broad view of e-readiness, whereby a country's e-business activity depends not only upon information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructure but also upon human capital and logistics infrastructure. The absence of a link between institutional factors and e-business suggests that e-business arises not only when supporting economic institutions exist but also as a means of overcoming inadequate institutional conditions.

AB The timing of market entry is a critical decision, involving the need to balance the risk of premature entry with the problems of missed opportunities as a result of late entry. Drawing from several theoretical perspectives, we propose a model for explaining the reasons for early or delayed entry into an emerging technology market. A novel feature of our study is the use of a hazard modeling framework to analyze longitudinal data pertaining to over 3500 entrants and nonentrants during the emergence of the automated teller machine market. This approach alleviates the sample selection problems associated with prior entry research. With caution in generalizing the results to other settings, we find compelling evidence in support of the model, extending our knowledge of the dynamics surrounding entry into certain technology markets.

   dependence on fine particle content
SO INDUSTRIAL CROPS AND PRODUCTS
LA English
DT Article
DE sedimentation; corn extract; interface; entrainment
AB Removing solid particles from ethanolic corn extracts by gravitational settling into a water layer has been studied as part of a project to develop a low cost method to extract ethanol-soluble protein from corn meal. Settling has several advantages over industrially proven methods of liquid/particle separation: (1) less expensive equipment; (2) particles that settle at different rates can be collected from different outlets, and (3) extract liquid entrained by settling particles dissolves in the water from which the ethanol can be recovered by distillation. When fine particles were pumped as part of the extract into the 5-1 settling layer at a high enough rate, they formed a particle layer at the extract/water interface. The particle layer prevents further settling and is a non-sustainable operating condition. The layer does not form when the mass fraction of particles in the extract was 0. 11 or less. This value is greater than the value obtained by extrapolating published settling data for denser (mineral) particles. Overall, entrainment of extract liquid for the settling was about the same as entrainment during centrifugation. In-line measurements and recordings of ethanol concentration, density, and particle content of the water stream carrying settled coarse particles from the settling tank showed that specific entrainment was greater for the finer particles.

DT Article
AB This paper deals with the Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SUDS) or Best Management Practices (BMPs). The concept of the sustainable development applied to the urban drainage supposes the application of these systems with the intention of avoiding problems like floods, diffuse contamination and loss of biodiversity. The main techniques are preventive measures, pervious surfaces, soakaways and infiltration trenches, infiltration basins, filter or French drains, swales, filter strips, detention basins, retention ponds and wetlands. By means of a multidisciplinary process several SUDS are selected to solve the urban drainage, these constitute a treatment train which results depend on, not only the parts, but also the link among them. Everything is done with the purpose of completing the conditions as for quantity, quality of water, and service imposed by the design criteria.

AB Manufacturing amnesia' argues that the term 'Corporate Social Responsibility' has been abandoned by most South African firms in favour of the term ` corporate social investment'. This has been done in order to divert attention from calls on business to redress the results of its historical contribution to the apartheid system. The discourse of reconciliation has further served to erase memories of past corporate behaviour. It also masks continuing inequalities and unsustainable practices. Business has responded weakly to the pressures for CSR, of which five broad areas are identified and analysed. Voluntary sustainability initiatives have not succeeded and compliance with black economic empowerment charters and environmental standards have to be legislated and regulated. Firms need to reassess their legacies more honestly until which time their CSR contributions will be regarded as cosmetic and self-serving.

ID SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY
AB Contrasting perspectives of international companies and civil society groups have divided recent debates about corporate responsibility in developing countries. The Corporate Social Responsibility discourse has been promoted by business lobbies, emphasizing the role of international companies in voluntarily contributing towards the solution of pressing social and environmental problems through partnerships with other stakeholders. The notion of corporate accountability has become the rallying point for sustainable development, demanding stricter regulation of corporate behaviour by national governments and the enactment of an international corporate accountability convention. This article assesses the promises and pitfalls of these two competing approaches to industries in South Africa. The article argues that a multi-level approach is necessary to the impact of CSR and corporate accountability initiatives. It concludes that CSR may improve environmental management systems and reduce corporate pollution levels whereas corporate accountability approaches may provide important incentives for companies to improve their environmental performance, assist in the development of national environmental governance frameworks guiding company - community interaction, and facilitate the enforcement of national legislation pertaining to corporate responsibility. However, both approaches fail to address the underlying, global-level structural causes of conflicts between companies and stakeholders affected by their operations. These conflicts can only be reversed by fundamental changes in the global economy.

AB This paper examines the implementation of British Council English language teaching projects at Chinese universities. The study argues that the key to successful cross-cultural communication is an informed appreciation of the perception gap that separates donor and recipient. Cultural sensitivity and the use of a culturally appropriate methodology are of fundamental importance in educational development projects. The study argues that a local willingness to promote change is the key to sustainability of innovation. Rather than a focus on the transfer of technical skills in classrooms, the successful long-term impact of development projects depends upon professional empowerment and emancipation for the teachers.

ID SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; SOCIAL CRITERIA; POPULATION; ECONOMICS; ETHICS;
   FUTURE
AB Intergenerational impartiality requires putting the welfare of future generations at par with that of our own. However, rational choice requires weighting all welfare values by the respective probabilities of realization. As the risk of non-survival of mankind is strictly positive for all time periods and as the probability of non-survival is cumulative, the probability weights operate like discount factors, though justified on a morally justifiable and completely different ground. Impartial intertemporal welfare maximization is acceptable, though the welfare of people in the very far future has lower effects as the probabilities of their existence are also lower. However, the effective discount rate on future welfare values (distinct from monetary values) justified on this ground is likely to be less than 0.1 per annum. Such discounting does not compromise environmental protection and sustainability unduly. The finiteness of our universe implies that the sum of our expected welfare to infinity remains finite, solving the paradox of having to compare different infinite values in optimal growth/conservation theories.

ID ANIMAL-WELFARE
AB Procedures that increase the sustainability of agriculture often result in animals being treated more humanely: both livestock in animal and mixed farming and wildlife in arable farming. Equally, procedures ensuring humane treatment of farm animals often increase sustainability, for example in disease control and manure management. This overlap between sustainability and humaneness is not coincidental. Both approaches can be said to be animal centered, to be based on the fact that animal production is primarily a biological process. Proponents of both will gain from recognition of commonality and development of cooperation. A collaborative approach to humane sustainable agriculture will benefit animals, people, and the environment.

AB \The author uses two publications, Fighting Poverty in the US and Europe (Alesina and Glaeser) and Poetry magazine, to underscore the important role that educational institutions play in developing a person's political philosophy and imagination. European nations, for instance, have better funded social welfare programs than the US because their system of public education incorporates more liberal or left-leaning teachings into their standard curricula. The author sees implications for a more intentional approach to education in the US for those who are interested in changing the food system. If American educational institutions viewed their role as producing food competent citizens, he argues, then we would be more successful in addressing obesity, promoting a more sustainable food system, and even reducing poverty. Food system activists, dieticians and nutritionists, parents, and elected officials should take a more aggressive position with educational institutions to develop programs, services, and curricula capable of achieving these ends.

AB Field trials evaluating the potential of the entomopathogenic nematode Steinernema carpocapsae and the feasibility to combine nematodes with Bacillus thuringiensis for sustainable control of the diamondback moth (DBM) Plutella xylostella were conducted in cabbage cultivated in the province Probolinggo, east Java and Indonesia. A single use of 0.5 million S. carpocapsae m(-2) applied with a surfactant-polymer-formulation containing 0.3% xanthan and 0.3% Rimulgan((R)) achieved a significant reduction of the insects per plant with > 50% control after 7 days. Even 14 days after the application about 45% control was recorded and dead larvae containing nematodes were found. No significant effects were recorded when the formulation was compared with nematodes applied in water or with a surfactant alone. This was attributed to high humidity in the experimental area at the end of the rainy season and a microclimate in the cabbage heads favouring nematode survival. Weekly applications of B. thuringiensis (Turex((R))) or alternating applications of Turex((R)) and the nematodes achieved > 80% control. The application of both biological agents together every second week reached insignificant lower efficacy (70%). Nematodes can be used to substitute ineffective chemical insecticides and alterations with B. thuringiensis can prevent the further development of resistance against the bacterial control agent.

AB EU regulations recommend effluent treatment and nutrient recycling for aquaculture sustainability, so a study was undertaken to provide base-line data for the integration of commercial fish-farm effluents with the production of microalgae. The project relates to a specific bivalve consumer ( Tapes decussatus) and biofiltration. Effluent inorganic nutrient composition was assessed and evaluated as culture media for Phaeodactylum tricornutum, Tetraselmis suecica and Tetraselmis sp. Optimization of the microalgal compartment included studies on preparation of a simple medium, nutrient or dilution rate manipulation and nutrient removal. Cell harvest was increased chiefly by N correction (6-fold for Tetraselmis sp.) and semi-continuous or continuous operation ( by a factor of 3 to 11). Nutrient removal efficiency was high for ammonium and nitrite-nitrogen ( 80 - 100%), depending on species, nutrient ratio ( Si correction for P. tricornutum) and culture regime for nitrate ( 41 - 100%) or phosphorus ( 21 - 99%). Data obtained under cyclostat cultivation ( yields of 1.38 and 0.50 x 10(6) P. tricornutum or Tetraselmis sp. cells mL(-1) d(-1) and nutrient uptake rates of 2.32 mg N L-1 d(-1) and 0.96 mg P L-1 d(-1)) were used to show clam production and simultaneous wastewater treatment possibilities through the proposed fish-microalgae-clam integrated aquaculture system.

AB This paper describes the reproductive biology and growth of Ibacus alticrenatus, I. brucei, and I. chacei from the east coast of Queensland. Australia. Reproductive cycles, sizes at maturity. sex ratios, morphological data, egg sizes, brood fecundities. length-frequency distributions. and growth parameters are described. Ibacus chacei numerically dominated both the commercial and research charter samples and were followed by I. brucei and I. altierenatus in abundance respectively. Seasonal reproductive data indicated that I. brucei and I. chacei have an annual cycle of reproduction, with oviposition and hatching occurring earlier and over a shorter period in I. brucei. Gonadal maturation in ovigerous I. chacei suggested that more than one brood could be produced in a spawning season; however, reproductive activity was geographically restricted. Carapace lengths of ovigerous lobsters ranged 38.2-52.0 mm for I. alticrentatus, 44.6-69.7 mm for I. brucei. and 53.7-76.2 mm for I. chacei. Brood fecundity was size dependent and highest in I. brucei (2049-61,339) but markedly lower in I. chacei (2117-28,793) and I. alticrenatus (1734-14.762). Egg size in all three species was independent of carapace lenght. positively related to developmental stage, and ranged 0.94-1.29 mm for I. alticrentatus, 0.73-1.01 mm for I. brucei, and 1.02-1.37 turn for I. chacei. Monthly length-frequency distributions for I. chacei displayed marked multi-modality and indicated a prolonged recruitment period with moulting occurring 3-4 times within their first year post-recruitment. Growth Curves of I. chacei indicated that females reach sexual maturity 1.7-2 yrs post settlement and that individuals approached their L-max within 5-7 yrs. These results are discussed in relation to comparisons between each species and other members of the Scyllaridae family, and provide invaluable biological information for the development of sustainable management strategies for Queensland's lbacus species.

SO JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE

DE dairy cattle; breeding objective; restricted index; sustainability
ID FUNCTIONAL TRAITS; ECONOMIC VALUES
AB The objective was to present 2 methods for the derivation of nonmarket values for functional traits in dairy cattle using deterministic simulation and selection index theory. A nonmarket value can be a value representing animal welfare and societal influences for animal production, which can be added to market economic values in the breeding goal to define sustainable breeding goals. The first method was restricted indices. A consequence of adding a nonmarket value to a market economic value for a given functional trait is less selection emphasis on milk yield. In the second method, the loss in selection response in milk resulting from greater emphasis on functional traits was quantified. The 2 methods were demonstrated using a breeding goal for dairy cattle with 4 traits (milk yield, mastitis resistance, conception rate, and stillbirth). Nonmarket values derived separately using restricted indices were 0.4 and 2.6 times the value of market economic values for mastitis resistance and conception rate, respectively. Nonmarket values for mastitis resistance and conception rate were both lower when derived simultaneously than when derived separately. This was due to the positive genetic correlation between mastitis resistance and conception rate, and because both traits are negatively correlated with milk yield. Using the second method and accepting a 5% loss in selection response for milk yield, nonmarket values for mastitis, conception rate, and stillbirth were 0.3, 1.4, and 2.9 times the market economic values. It was concluded that the 2 methods could be used to derive nonmarket values for functional traits in dairy cattle.

AB When evaluating the potential of irrigation for agricultural production one must consider more than the technical and financial potential and feasibility of the scheme. Issues of environmental and social sustainability must also be considered. The purpose of the paper is to develop a framework for assessing the sustainability of an irrigation scheme and apply it in the context of one such scheme in south eastern Nigeria. The framework for assessment is based on a comparison of differential changes in environmental quality with and without the scheme, and before and after the schemed The author does this by using measured soil characteristics for irrigated and adjacent rain-fed plots of agricultural land; and socioeconomic analysis of other environmental and social impacts of the irrigation scheme.
   Data were collected through a field survey of the selected irrigated and rain-fed farm plots, qualitative interviews with the farm owners and relevant secondary sources.
   The analyses find that the soils of the irrigated farms have been significantly degraded more than those of the rain-fed farms to the extent that precludes sustainable practice of arable agriculture on irrigated land in the study area. About 9% of the soils of the irrigated land have been degraded to the extent that they are no longer suitable for arable agriculture. Analyses of the qualitative interviews also find other bio-physical, social and economic impacts that significantly constrain long-term sustainability of arable agriculture in the study area.

AB The main aim of this article is to examine and review the usage of forests for the purpose of tourism in Turkey with the case study of Antalya-Belek. The use and conversion of forest lands is central to tourism development. Land use change is responsible for the majority of the negative environmental impacts of tourism on natural resources. Worldwide, forests and coastal zones are converted for the construction of tourist facilities. The rapid emergence of mass tourism development in Turkey, encouraged without considering protection and sustainable use of natural and cultural resources, has resulted in serious problems in forest areas. This paper is particularly concerned with land use change in forests (or deforestation) created by the allocation of forest lands to build tourist facilities. In Belek, a tourism center located in Antalya province ' s coastal areas and the fastest growing destination of the country, all tourist facilities have been established in forest lands under the status of conservation forest. Today, the Belek Conservation Forest is under severe pressure from tourism. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Two serine proteinases from the midgut of Helicoverpa armigera have been partially purified and characterized. One proteinase, HGP-1, was capable of hydrolyzing a synthetic substrate of elastase and was inhibited by elastatinal. The second proteinase, HGP-2, was inhibited by a trypsin inhibitor. Molecular weights of HGP-1 and HGP-2 were approximately 26.0 and 29.0 kDa, respectively. Both the proteinases exhibited alkaline pH optima in the range of 10-11. Furthermore, interaction of HGP-1 and HGP-2 with proteinase inhibitors (PIs) from host and non-host plants was studied. HGP-1 was not only insensitive to a PI from chickpea (host) but was also able to degrade it. The same PI from chickpea was able to inhibit over 50% activity of HGP-2. On the contrary, PIs from potato (non-host) showed strong inhibition of both, HGP-1 and HGP-2 and also demonstrated protection of chickpea seed proteins from digestion by both the HGPs. These results could provide important clues in designing strategies for sustainable use of plant PIs in developing insect-tolerant transgenic plants. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID ETHICS COMMITTEES
AB The "lone'' clinical bioethicist working in a large, multisite hospital faces considerable challenges. While attempting to build ethics capacity and sustain a demanding range of responsibilities, he or she must also achieve an acceptable level of integration, sustainability, and accountability within a complex organisational structure. In an effort to address such inherent demands and to create a platform towards better evaluation and effectiveness, the Clinical Ethics Group at the Joint Centre for Bioethics at the University of Toronto is implementing the Hub and Spokes Strategy at seven hospitals. The goal of the Hub and Spokes Strategy is to foster an ethical climate and strengthen ethics capacity broadly throughout healthcare settings as well as create models in clinical bioethics that are excellent and effective.

AB Mother-to-child transmission of HIV occurs during pregnancy, at the time of delivery, and through breastfeeding (BF). WHO recommends avoidance of all BF when replacement feeding (RF) is affordable, feasible, acceptable, sustainable, and safe. Otherwise, exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) followed by early BF cessation is recommended. Governments are currently scaling up programs to prevent infant HIV infection. Few data exist to guide policy decisions about the allocation of resources to prevent postnatal HIV transmission while minimizing the non-HIV-related risks of these policies. This paper presents an analysis of the impact of WHO infant feeding recommendations in different settings characterized by infant mortality rate (IMR). Mathematical simulation modeling is used to estimate the effects on HFS (HFS) through 24 mo of 3 intervention scenarios: RF from birth by HIV-positive mothers (RF24), EBF up to 6 mo followed by early BF cessation (EBF6), and the default scenario where there is no postnatal intervention (BF24). This analysis differs from earlier reports in that it uses the most recent data on risks of postnatal HIV transmission for mixed and exclusive BF. These simulations suggest that in settings where IMR is < 25/1000 live births, RF24 results in the greatest HFS to 24 mo; EBF6 produces the best outcome where IMR > 25/1000 live births. RF24 results in lower HFS than no postnatal intervention where IMR >= 101/1000. IMR-based analyses can help to guide government policy decisions about which infant feeding strategies to invest in and emphasize for HIV-positive mothers in different settings.

SO JOURNAL OF SANDWICH STRUCTURES & MATERIALS

DE wrinkling; local buckling; anisotropy; stability; sandwich
ID PLATES
AB The works that have been already published on sandwich face wrinkling consider isotropic or almost isotropic sandwich configurations. Hence, only the critical wrinkling load needs to be evaluated in the principal compressive stress direction. This is insufficient for a sandwich panel with a higher degree of anisotropy. This paper presents a method for estimating the wrinkling behavior of highly anisotropic sandwich panels under biaxial loading. The method is based on the assumption that wrinkling occurs at the angle where the ratio of applied load to sustainable wrinkling loads reaches a global maximum. In addition to the description of the analytical theories, the paper presents comparisons with finite element calculations and testing of real sandwich configurations. The results indicate that the derived model works excellently both for uni- and biaxial loadings, though a small factor of safety is required as with all other standard wrinkling theories.

TI Models for delivering school-based dental care
SO JOURNAL OF SCHOOL HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
AB School-based health centers (SBHCs) often are located in high-need schools and communities. Dental service is frequently an addition to existing comprehensive services, functioning in a variety of models, configurations, and locations. SBHCs are indicated when parents have limited financial resources or inadequate health insurance, limiting options for primary care and preventive services, or within low-access areas such as dental health professional shortage areas. Poor health and concomitantly poor oral health can lead to attendance problems. Oral health services in school-based setting are often the only access to services a child may have. Children who attend schools with SBHCs have immediate access to services that are coordinated with the student's family and school personnel or administrators. Comprehensive services can be collaborative, with support or administration provided by more than I organization. For example, the Children's Aid Society (CAS), Columbia University School of Dental and Oral Surgery (CUSDOS), and Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health developed, implemented, and currently operate SBHCs in 2 communities in the northern Manhattan section of New York City (Central Harlem and Washington-Heights/Inwood). The clinics operate in or are affiliated with public schools in New York City. All CAS and Columbia University sites include dental components, using a variety of delivery models. Determining which dental delivery system to use for a particular community or population is a complex decision. The models, reasons for selection, and sustainability of each system are described.

AB Denadai, B.S., E.B.G. Gomide, and C.C. Greco. The relationship between onset of blood lactate accumulation, critical velocity, and maximal lactate steady state in soccer players. J. Strength Cond. Res. 19(2):364-368. 2005-The objective of this study was to analyze the validity of the velocity corresponding to the onset of blood lactate accumulation (OBLA) and critical velocity (CV) to determine the maximal lactate steady state (MLSS) in soccer players. Twelve male soccer players (21.5 +/- 1.0 years) performed an incremental treadmill test for the determination of OBLA. The velocity corresponding to OBLA (3.5 mM of blood lactate) was determined through linear interpolation. The subjects returned to the laboratory on 7 occasions for the determination of MLSS and CV. The MLSS was determined from 5 treadmill runs of up to 30-minute duration and defined as the highest velocity at which blood lactate did not increase by more than I mM between minutes 10 and 30 of the constant velocity runs. The CV was determined by 2 maximal running efforts of 1,500 and 3,000 m performed on a 400-m running track. The CV was calculated as the slope of the linear regression of distance run versus time. Analysis of variance revealed no significant differences between OBLA (13.6 +/- 1.4 km center dot h(-1)) and MLSS (13.1 +/- 1.2 km center dot h(-1)) and between OBLA and CV (14.4 +/- 1.1 km center dot h(-1)). The CV was significantly higher than the MLSS. There was a significant correlation between MLSS and OBLA (r = 0.80), MLSS and CV (r = 0.90), and OBLA and CV (r = 0.80). We can conclude that the OBLA can be utilized in soccer players to estimate the MLSS. In this group of athletes, however, CV does not represent a sustainable steady-state exercise intensity.

TI Transmission loss measurement of consolidated granular media (L)
SO JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA
LA English
DT Article
ID ELEMENT
AB The normal incidence transmission loss of a new class of sustainable acoustic materials, i.e. consolidated granular media, has been measured to determine their sound insulating performance. Tests performed on different samples in a standing wave tube suggest that the traditional method employing an anechoic termination assumption can yield serious errors because its accuracy depends significantly on the properties of both the termination and the tested sample. Since it is not possible to implement a perfect anechoic termination over a wide frequency range, a well-developed alternative approach has been adopted. A simple theoretical analysis has been carried out to compare these two methods. It has been shown that the two-load method, based on two sets of measurements with different boundary conditions at the tube termination, can give more reliable and predictable results. Greater discrepancies have been observed in the case of the anechoic termination method applied to samples with higher values of flow resistivity. Results of the two-load method match well with predictions based on a simple model for acoustic transmission through a porous plate. (c) 2005 Acoustical Society of America.

TI Management and performance of Taiwan's waste recycling fund
SO JOURNAL OF THE AIR & WASTE MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Taiwan's resource recycling program was formally established in 1989, starting with the mandatory recycling of polyethylene terephthalate bottles. The number of mandatory regulated materials was extended to 8 categories with 27 items by 2002. Because of false data reporting, financial scandal, lack of transparency of the system, and the demand from parliament, the recycling policy has gradually changed from entirely privatized to being nationalized. Currently, the structure is built on six main bodies: fund management committee, consumers, industries responsible, recyclers, fee reviewing committee, and auditing agents. The industries that are responsible submit a fee, which is set by the fee reviewing committee, to the waste recycling fund (WRF), which is operated by the fund management committee. The auditing agents routinely check the responsible industries by documentation review as well as on-site counting to ensure that the fee is correctly submitted. The WRF provides initiatives to collect and dispose of the end-of-life products. The fund is split into a trust fund and a nonbusiness fund to deal with the collection, disposal, and treatment of the listed materials. The latter deals with the supporting works and ensures that the system runs effectively. The ratio of trust fund to nonbusiness fund is 80-20%. It is no doubt that the current practice achieves some improvements. Household waste has been reduced by 22%. And, most importantly, the benefit-to-cost ratio was as high as 1.24. However, similar to other state-owned systems, the resource recycling program has been criticized for false reporting from the responsible industries, a rigid system, and complicated procedures. To build a sustainable enterprise, the recycling program should be privatized as the recycling market and operating procedures are well established and fully mature.

AB There is a growing commercialization of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) as a means of livelihood by rural communities throughout the developing world. This often occurs in the absence of any clear understanding of or guidelines regarding sustainable yields and ecological impacts, which may undermine the success of NTFP enterprises, especially from and regions. This paper reports on the use of size class profiles and three quantitative indices to examine population profiles of five potentially useful tree species used as NTFPs in the semiarid lowveld of South Africa. We also contrast the population densities of the five tree species in 2003 with data from 1992. Low stem densities and population profiles indicated that three of the five species would preclude the establishment of NTFP enterprises based on their products. The other two species seem to have sufficient densities for some harvesting to take place, within an adaptive management framework. However, the longitudinal data indicated that the density of both these species had significantly declined over an eleven-year period, highlighting the need for appropriate management institutions. Additionally, the proportion of mature stems cut, and the degree of cutting per stem, had increased for all five species over the eleven years. The three quantitative indices of population stability were not correlated with one another, and hence provided a useful suite of measures sensitive to different aspects of size class profiles and their interpretation.

TI Impact of indigenous-based interventions on land conservation: A case

AB Land degradation has been identified as a serious problem in Tanzania since the 1920s. Among the factors normally cited as contributing to land degradation are deforestation, overgrazing and inappropriate farming practices. Several attempts by the government to arrest the problem have been based on top-down approaches. Indigenous-based interventions are among the alternative practices adopted by the Soil Conservation and Agroforestry Project in Arumeru District, Tanzania. The main objective of this study was to assess the impact of the indigenous-based interventions on land conservation. More specifically the study intended to assess farmers' perception of land degradation, the adoption rate of indigenous-based interventions, the impact of those interventions, and lastly the sustainability of those interventions. Data for the study were collected through Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) techniques and a questionnaire survey. The Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS (R)) was used to analyse quantitative data and Content and Structural-Functional Analyses were used for qualitative data. The study found that the rate of land degradation was perceived by respondents to be rather severe. The study also revealed that indigenous-based interventions, which require minimal labour and capital, have been highly adopted by many farmers while labour/capital intensive ones have been taken up by fewer farmers. In general, indigenous-based interventions appear to have eased farm operations and contributed towards increased crop yield, improved soil fertility and increased income. Success in some of the indigenous interventions warrants their wider promotion beyond the project area. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ID ENVIRONMENTAL AMENITIES; RESERVE PROGRAM
AB Since 1999, China has pursued Grain for Green, an ambitious conservation set-aside program to prevent soil erosion. This paper evaluates its cost-effectiveness and sustainability. The results indicate that while the program has made a clear attempt to retire plots that are susceptible to soil erosion, there is room for better targeting. The government also may be able to generate fiscal savings if the payments more accurately reflect the differences in the opportunity costs of each plot. The study finds that some farmers may reconvert the land back to cultivation after program ends.

AB We report a reversal in the sign of the herbivore-phytoplankton interaction between the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) and Microcystis aeruginosa, a harmful planktonic cyanobacterium. A pair of large-scale manipulations of mussel density in the same lake in consecutive years showed that when phosphorus concentrations were very low (mean total phosphorus [TP] similar to 3 mu g L-1), the effect of Dreissena on the biomass of M. aeruginosa was monotonically negative across the full range of sustainable mussel densities. When the enclosures were fertilized with phosphorus (mean TP similar to 9 mu g L-1), there was a monotonically positive effect of Dreissena on M. aeruginosa across the same mussel gradient. These contrasting results indicate that D. polymorpha feeds on M. aeruginosa, as shown in previous laboratory feeding experiments, but that the positive effects of D. polymorpha on M. aeruginosa can be larger than the negative effects of consumption. A sign reversal in the interaction between these two species is congruent with highly variable patterns in the response of M. aeruginosa to D. polymorpha invasion across lake and river systems in North America.

AB The diet of the Humboldt penguin (Spheniscus humboldti) was examined and compared in two colonies in Chile. Field work was conducted on Pan de Azucar Island in northern Chile in the breeding season 1998/1999 and on the Punihuil Islands in southern Chile over two successive breeding seasons during 1997/1998 and 1998/1999. Penguin diet was studied by stomach-pumping birds and analysed by species composition, size and mass of prey. Fish were the dominant prey item at both sites, the contribution of cephalopods and crustaceans varying between sites. The fish prey consisted predominantly of school fish, but there were clear latitudinal differences in fish prey taken. Penguins in the northern colony consumed primarily garfish (Scomberesox saurus), while birds at the southern colony of Punihuil fed primarily on anchovy (Engraulis ringens), Araucanian herring (Strangomera bentincki) and silverside (Odontesthes regia). The results showed significant differences in terms of numbers of fish taken between the two breeding seasons at Punihuil. In 1997/1998 penguins consumed almost exclusively anchovy, while they fed primarily on silversides in the successive year. Almost all prey, except stomatopods, were characterised as being pelagic species that occur in relatively inshore water, consistent with the foraging behaviour of Humboldt penguins. The dependence of Humboldt penguins on commercially exploited, schooling prey species makes the species particularly susceptible to changes in prey stocks, due to non-sustainable fisheries management.

ID MANAGEMENT
AB Within the European Union, scientific fisheries research and advice is passed down a chain of central European institutions before being incorporated into policy. However, advice is often poorly or only partially implemented and the system has largely failed to achieve sustainable fisheries management.
   This paper aims to explain why, by examining the use of fisheries science within the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). The problem is examined with respect to both the political system and fisheries science, to show that the factors in both the supply, and the subsequent use, of scientific data inhibit effective fisheries management.

AB Sustainable fishery development indicator system (SFDIS) is a good reference that reflects fishery variations at different times and locations. It keeps the industry abreast of the latest developments and allows for timely revision of management policies and structures that could lead to its sustainable development. This study uses the Gungliau area in Taiwan as an example to evaluate the development of the SFDIS. This is the first time Factor Analysis is applied practically on the indicator aggregation. Results show that this indicator system reflects the time variation of each indicator and indicates sustainable trend at each developmental stage. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID STOCK ASSESSMENT
AB The Pew Charitable Trusts have recently supported a study of the regional fishery management councils responsible for managing US coastal fish stocks. The four key findings of this report may be thought of as an attempt to answer two fundamental concerns: (i) Who should make the management decisions?, and (ii) Who should take responsibility for making these decisions? This paper provides a rational reply to these concerns by negatively reforming the questions, as: (i) How do we ensure that a decision-making is not based on irrational arguments, and (ii) How do we ensure that normative goals (maximum sustainable yields, optimum yields) are not viewed as objective scientific predictions.

DE capacity expansion; technology; sustainable management
AB According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, overcapacity in the fishing fleet poses a fundamental challenge in fisheries. Overcapacity leads to an increased pressure on fish stocks and a decrease in economic profit. The fishing fleet is marginalised economically, and overcapacity creates allocation conflicts between different gear and vessel groups. In addition, the expenses to control and management increase. Although Norwegian authorities have introduced several restrictions, for example total allowable catch, licenses, vessel quotas, and other regulatory measures, this article shows that the problems connected to overcapacity persist. Analyses of the technical capacity development show that there is an overall capacity expansion although the number of vessels is reduced. This development is an indicator of the dynamics of technological development over time, and the article discusses whether the concept of technology is sufficiently integrated into fisheries management. The important question now is whether analyses of the technical capacity development can serve as a positive supplement to the traditional fisheries management, which largely is based on input from the scientific disciplines biology and economics.

SO MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Livestock production is a key livelihood strategy and a way of life for most small-holders in the Hindukush. Depending on ethnicity, access to land, labor force, and ecological conditions, small to large herds of goats, sheep, cattle and buffalo serve as a primary or secondary source of livelihood. Ongoing deterioration of environmental conditions- frequently due to overgrazing- and the depletion of timber and firewood resources-often linked to demographic and economic pressure both in the highlands and the lowland-increasingly worsen living condition. Alternative livelihood strategies and pathways to more sustainable natural resource use are needed. A combined research and development project, based on long-standing local research and participatory development efforts, launched in the North-Western Frontier Province of Pakistan (NWFP); aims to better assess and compare the situations in 3 different valleys, and to test concrete options for improving livestock output. Standard de-worming practices are being combined with a novel methods of supplementing locally produced, season-specific, critically deficient nutrients for the animal, based on local environmental needs.

AB This article presents an empirical interdisciplinary study of an extensive participatory process that was carried out in 2004 in the recently established World Natural Heritage Site "Jungfrau-Aletsch-Bietschhorn" in the Swiss Alps. The study used qualitative and quantitative empirical methods of social science to address the question of success factors in establishing and concretizing a World Heritage Site. Current international scientific and policy debates agree that the most important success factors in defining pathways for nature conservation and protection are: linking development and conservation, involving multiple stakeholders, and applying participatory approaches. The results of the study indicate that linking development and conservation implies the need to extend the reach of negotiations beyond the area of conservation, and to develop both a regional perspective and a focus on sustainable regional development. In the process, regional and local stakeholders are less concerned with defining sustainability goals than elaborating strategies of sustainability, in particular defining the respective roles of the core sectors of society and economy. However the study results also show that conflicting visions and perceptions of nature and landscape are important underlying currents in such negotiations. They differ significantly between various stakeholder categories and are an important cause of conflicts occurring at various stages of the participatory process.

ID LAND MANAGEMENT
AB Initiating a process of informed decision making for sustainable development requires the following: a) the values and objectives to be pursued need to be negotiated among all concerned stakeholders of a specific territorial unit; b) these stakeholders should have access to a comparable level of knowledge; and c) the decisions taken and the subsequent actions initiated should have a positive impact on all dimensions of sustainability, In the remote Tajik Pamir mountains, a special effort was made to fulfill the above 3 principles by developing and applying a new methodological approach to sustainable development.
   The paper presents the results of a multi-year baseline study project in which 10 sectors ranging from agriculture to natural hazards were assessed by a transdisciplinary Swiss-Tajik research team. This knowledge base was enhanced in a development strategy workshop that brought together stakeholders from the local to the international levels. The methodology applied was found appropriate to initiate a broad reflection and negotiation process among various stakeholder groups, leading to a joint identification of possible measures to be taken. Knowledge-and its enhancement through the involvement of all stakeholder levels-appeared to be an effective carrier of innovation and changes of attitudes, thus containing the potential to effectively contribute to sustainable development in marginalized and resource-poor mountain areas.

AB Mountains play a crucial role in the supply of freshwater to humankind, in highland and lowland areas alike. Increasing demand urgently , requires careful management of mountain water resources in order to mitigate growing water crises and conflicts. Monitored river flow was analyzed for 3 selected catchments (Timau, Burguret, and Likii) on the slopes of Mount Kenya from 1960 to 2004. In the 10 years from 1995 to 2004, the extreme low flow (Q95) of the rivers was found to have been reduced to 10%, 23%, and 71%, respectively, of the values for the decade from 1961 to 1970. Water awareness creation campaigns in 1997 and 2004 revealed that the number of abstraction points had more than doubled, and that there was a two- to eightfold increase in the amount of river water abstracted.
   The present article documents increasing water abstraction and the difficulties in establishing limits for low flows such as the Q80 value (flow available on 80% of the days per year). The article also presents the role of Water Users' Associations (WUAs) in mitigating water conflicts related to over-abs traction. Evaluation of the activities of 13 WUAs showed that they solved 45 of 52 conflicts. WUAs are also involved in activities such as environmental education, awareness creation, improved irrigation practices, afforestation, and regulating water. The recent restructuring of the government ministry resulted in a formalized role for WUAs. Long-term data on availability, abstraction, and use of water are needed to mitigate water conflicts within and between WUAs, negotiate water allocation, and establish allocation thresholds.

AB One of the most important endemic tree species of Chile and at the same time one of the most endangered ones is Araucaria araucana (Mol.) C. Koch, the monkey puzzle tree. It grows in the Andes Mountains, homeland of the indigenous Mapuche Pewenche people who depend on this tree. This paper is based on field research that investigated the ecological knowledge, uses and management of the Araucaria araucana forest by indigenous Mapuche Pewenche people based on the sociocultural, spiritual and ecological relationships they have with the Araucaria forest, to find out how indigenous people and their knowledge could contribute to sustainable Araucaria forest management. A Mapuche Pewenche community located in the IX region of Chile contributed to this study. Based on the analyses this paper illustrates the nature of indigenous ecological knowledge of Araucaria araucana on the one hand, and its utility in native forest management on the other. The research shows that the Mapuche Pewenche hold ecological knowledge and conduct practices to manage their Araucaria forest in a balanced way. They conserve and use forest biodiversity at one and the same time. This paper provides recommendations for sustainable Araucaria forest management and conservation strategies ex-situ and in-situ incorporating indigenous knowledge and scientific knowledge and for promoting a collaborative natural resources management.

AB Over the past 10-15 years, several governments have implemented an array of technology, support-related, sustainable livelihoods (SL) and poverty-reduction projects for artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM). In the majority of cases, however, these interventions have failed to facilitate improvements in the industry's productivity and raise the living standards of the sector's subsistence operators. This article argues that a poor understanding of the demographics of target populations has precipitated these outcomes. In order to strengthen policy and assistance in the sector, governments must determine, with greater precision, the number of people operating in ASM regions, their origins and ethnic backgrounds, ages, and educational levels. This can be achieved by carrying out basic and localized census work before promoting ambitious sector-speck projects aimed at improving working conditions in the industry.

   River steelhead: Declines in productivity make rebuilding difficult

AB We collected adult and juvenile spawner recruit data on wild summer steelhead Oncorhynchus mykiss for the Snake River and estimated parameters for fisheries management by partitioning the data into predam and postdam periods and fitting the Ricker and Beverton-Holt models to those time series. The results showed a decline in productivity irrespective of the model chosen and the way in which the pre- and postdam periods were defined. However, the data were noisy and the confidence bounds on parameter estimates were fairly large. To reconcile the different management goals derived from the different data sources (adult or juvenile data) or model choice (Ricker or Beverton-Holt), we used simulation techniques and Bayesian algorithms. The combined approach Suggests a recovery management goal (i.e., spawning stock associated with the maximum sustainable yield) of 60,000 steelhead above Lower Granite Dam. At current smolt-to-adult survival rates, the data indicate optimal escapement of between 20,000 and 27,000 adults. We note that Snake River steelhead stocks cannot be managed for recovery escapement levels given current estimates of smolt-to-adult survival rates, and we discuss alternatives for present-day management and rebuilding over time.

DT Article
ID SALVELINUS-NAMAYCUSH; SURVIVAL; ONTARIO
AB We analyzed tag-recapture data for lake trout Salvelinus namaycush from the U.S. waters of Lake Superior to determine whether (1) mean movement distance varied among management units, (2) mean movement distance and recapture percentage differed between spawning and nonspawning recapture seasons, (3) percentages of movements to the east and west were similar, and (4) movement distance varied with body length, sex, origin, age, or time at liberty. Mean distance moved by lake trout varied among management units. Mean movement distance was lower for fish recaptured during the spawning season than for fish recaptured during the nonspawning season for three of four tagged populations, and the spatial distribution of recapture percentages differed between recapture seasons. On average, lake trout recaptured during the nonspawning season traveled 42 km while at liberty. Lake trout tagged in two of six management units emigrated to the east and west in equal percentages, but lake trout did not emigrate from the tagging unit to other management units at equal percentages. Movement distance varied significantly with time at liberty for lake trout tagged in one management unit, but did not vary significantly with length, age, time at liberty, sex, or origin for those tagged in other management units. Lake Superior fishery managers can use our results to account for lake trout movements between management units when calculating sustainable harvest levels with catch-at-age modeling.

AB During the past centuries, industrial processes and energy conversion plants have shown no or little care for environmental quality. The result is a huge accumulation of pollution and hazardous by-products, left as a heritage for the present and future generations. Recuperation of by-products or thermal energy is not only motivated by cost saving, but also by resource saving considerations. Environmental awareness is more than staying within the lines of the existing regulations.
   By the application of a plasma based system to a wide range of possible feedstocks which are CO2 neutral, a clean syngas of high caloric value is produced from the organic substances simultaneously with a non-leachable vitrified lava from the inorganic substances. The results will provide the advanced technology for the environmentally friendly treatment of hazardous wastes, biomass and low grade fuel. The driving force behind the task is to give priority to environmental quality at affordable costs. Thus, the investigation of ways to increase the efficiency of the process is very important. A plasma based remediation system is the only technology that prevents undesired pollution in the by-products and end product (such as syngas or other gases). The problem to be solved is twofold: recuperate clean energy from waste and renewables without pollution at affordable costs. Such a technique fulfils the objectives of sustainable development.
   Today, one of the main reasons that restricts the use of plasma based methods is the cost of electrical energy. The crucial element is the plasma torch performance. Hence, the physics of modem plasma torches is addressed in detail. The optimistic scenario holds the promise to provide 10-15% of the energy needs for the European Union (EU). Thus, the investigation of ways to increase the efficiency of the process is very important.

AB One of the biggest barriers to introducing sustainable local transport initiatives-be it bus lanes, cycle paths, speed humps or congestion charges-is failure to communicate the benefits of such schemes to the communities they will serve. This paper reports on research that was undertaken in response to increasing evidence that negative media coverage, poor relations with the media, poor communication practices and public resistance to projects were acting as barriers to the delivery of transport programmes for a number of UK local authorities. The work culminated in the production of a 'toolkit' for local authorities to help them communicate more effectively, both with the media and directly with the public.

AB Measuring land-cover change is an essential part of sustainable conservation planning. This project uses Landsat MSS and ETM+ data to document forest cover change in the Toledo District, Belize, from 1975 to 1999 and provides an initial assessment of why these changes took place. Supervised and subpixel classification methods were employed. The results showed an aggregate forest loss of almost 10 percent, which is approximately 36,000 ha. Deforestation expanded significantly in the most populous Mayan areas of central Toledo District and along the Guatemalan border. Subpixel classification results showed that in 1999 the most densely forested areas were in northern Toledo District in the Maya Mountains.

AB As the evidence-based intervention (EBI) movement proliferated in medicine, psychology, and education, interest turned to establishing criteria for determining whether an intervention and/or program can be described as "evidence-based." Less attention has been focused on establishing an empirical basis to understand and facilitate adoption of EBIs in practice settings. In this article, the Evidence-Based Intervention Work Group at the University of Wisconsin-Madison reviews some conceptual and theoretical models that have bearing on future research regarding this adoption process. First, we provide a brief overview of the EBI movement and then argue for research on the conceptual and theoretical models pertaining to adoption of EBIs. Specifically, conceptual and/or theoretical models of change and adoption of innovation are discussed for consideration in research and practice in the EBI movement. Applications and limitations of the approaches are discussed within the context of the adoption and sustainability of EBIs in practice settings. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI Integrating gender into government budgets: A new perspective
SO PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB A government's budget represents a statement of its priorities. During the past 25 years, the international community has recognized that gender equality is essential for sustainable economic growth and full social development, and it has called upon nations to use their budgets to promote gender-equitable resource allocation and revenue generation. More than 60 countries have answered this call by implementing gencler-responsive budgets at the national and subnational levels. However, gencler-responsive budgeting is virtually unheard of among public finance scholars and U.S. public administration scholars and practitioners. Here we define gencler-responsive budgeting, discuss the need for it, describe the lessons learned, and discuss its potential as a budget reform. We hope our commentary will bring gencler-responsive budgeting into the mainstream of research in the U.S. public administration community and into the practice of government budgeting.

AB The development of the four generations of Reproductive Biotechnology, particularly in cattle and since the last world war, represents one of the best examples of the success story of technology transfer. This review will only refer to the first three generations and will not deal with nuclear transfer nor transgenesis. Based on sound so-called "finalised" research, Artificial Insemination first, then in vivo collected embryo transfer and later in vitro fertilised embryo transfer have been implemented worldwide. Each of these Biotechnologies has many advantages and limitations. In addition to the specificity of each of them, one major point is that farmers and breeders may choose either collectively or individually, the best technology to be used in order to achieve the goals they have set for their industry. It is noteworthy that these technologies have been able to match with the economics demands over the last decades and yet are in a very good capacity to respond to the contemporary demand of sustainable development. In this context, there are further advantages such as potentially contributing to maintaining biodiversity or allowing preservation ex situ of genes otherwise threatened to extinction.

ID MODEL
AB Healthcare waste management within the United Kingdom (UK) has been identified as an area requiring extensive adoption of Best Practice (DETR, 2000). The National Health Service (NHS) generated 384,698 tonnes of waste in 2001. In order the manage this waste effectively, strategic and tactical tools within the NHS are required, which is a large complex organisation. Examples of such tools which could be used to deliver Best Practice within a hospital environment are the Strategic Waste Achievement Programme (SWAP) methodology and structured systems analysis design method (SSADM). SWAP is a strategic tool for senior managers and policy makers that can be used to develop sustainable waste management programmes and strategies for the whole organisation. An outline of SWAP is included in this paper. SSADM is the standard methodology used by the UK government for the development of their information systems. Some functional aspects of SSADM have been adapted for the documentation of waste generation and waste streams within an acute general hospital. A diagrammatic representation of the systems in place is the output from the waste flow diagrams (WFDs). These are relevant to the tactical levels within the organisation as the diagrams can be 'walked through' with the hospital managers and staff. The adoption of the methodology led to easily identified savings, amounting to over  pound 28,000 for no capital outlay. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The Godineau (South Oropuche) Swamp (3171 ha) on the southwestern coast of Trinidad (10 degrees 13-15'N, 61 degrees 30-32'W) is heavily impacted by anthropogenic activities including fishing, oil exploration, drainage manipulation and wetland clearance. To reduce the negative effects of these activities and to manage the swamp more sustainably, more quantitative information is needed on the ecology of the wetland and the activities that occur within it. This study focuses on the distribution of the fish resources and exploited fisheries as a basis for more informed management directives. Sampling was conducted during 2002, in April-May (for dry season) and July-September (for wet season sampling). Ichthyofauna was sampled both day and night using trammel nets and a push seine. Fishing activities were assessed using a questionnaire and informal discussions with fishers. The wetland supports over 29 species of fish distributed over the freshwater, estuarine and saline zones (n=1454). Species distribution is seasonal, with evidence of the wetland being used as a spawning ground. Species richness and species diversity (Shannon-Weiner Index) for the wetland ranged over 2-11 and 0.162-0.967, respectively, in the dry season and 2-7 and 0.036-0.903, respectively, in the Wet sea son. Communities inhabiting the saline and estuarine zones of the wetland were dominated by a single species, Hexanematichthys bonillai. Percent Similarity Indices were 41.8% for freshwater, 72.7% for estuarine and 79.8% for estuarine-saline communities. The commercial species accounted for 18% of total catch sampled and consisted of Centropomus undecimalis, Megalops atlanticus, Hoplosternum littorale, Hoplias malabaricus, Ophioscion punctatissimus and Macrodon ancyclodon. Full-time and part-time fishers, including recreational fishers, accounted for 14.3% and 85.7%, respectively of all fishers surveyed (n=56). A conservative estimate of the revenue earned directly at point of sale for fish and shellfish, is approximately US$43 000 per annum. Fishing is important in the area. Management directives taking into account the ecology of the target organisms are needed to allow these fishing practices to be continued in a sustainable manner.

AB The marine ornamental fish trade began in the 1930s in Sri Lanka, spread to Hawaii and the Philippines in the 1950s, and expanded to a multi-million dollar industry in the 1970s with fisheries established throughout the tropical Pacific, Indian and Atlantic Oceans. Currently, 45 countries supply global markets an estimated 14-30 million fish annually, with an import value of US$28-44 million. The largest suppliers are Indonesia and the Philippines, followed by Brazil, Maldives, Vietnam, Sri Lanka and Hawaii. In the tropical Western Atlantic, 16 countries have export fisheries, including the U.S. (Florida and Puerto Rico). The U.S. is the world's largest buyer, followed by the European Union and Japan. The global trade consists of over 1400 species of reef fishes, of which only about 25 are captive bred on a commercial scale. Damselfish, anemonefish, and angelfish constitute over 50% of the global volume; butterflyfish, wrasses, blennies, gobies, triggerfish, file-fish, hawkfishes, groupers and basselets account for 31% of the trade, and the remaining 16% is represented by 33 families. The most important fishes from the Caribbean are angelfish (six species), seahorses (two species), royal gramma, jawfish, queen triggerfish, redlip blenny, puddingwife, bluehead wrasse, and blue chromis. The Caribbean currently supplies a small percentage of the global trade in marine ornamental species, but ornamental fisheries in this region represent important emerging industries. It is critical that effective ornamental fishery management plans and regulations are developed and enforced, and fishery-dependent and fishery-independent data are collected and utilized in decision making processes to ensure sustainable ornamental fisheries throughout the region.

   regulatory policy; sustainable fisheries; Puerto Rico
AB In recent years the collection of tropical marine organisms for the aquarium trade has become perceived as an activity with an unsustainable history as well as obvious potential for rehabilitation through resource-based fisheries management and consumer-oriented product certification. In the case of Puerto Rico, collection of ornamentals has existed for decades, though unregulated due to a weak fisheries law dating from the 1930's. The new Fisheries Law 278 of 1998 enabled new regulatory approaches for marine ornamentals, which were met with serious challenges rooted in (1) an information gap concerning the fishery regarding participant numbers, collection methods and export volumes, and (2) the absence of consultation of fishers by agency regulators. The information gap led to worst-case assumptions of impact by regulators, and a closure of the fishery, which set the stage for threatening personal confrontations and lawsuits, the latter leading to de facto resource management by judicial order. To redress these issues and move management back into the arena of science and public policy, regulators have initiated a three-phase program: (1) characterize fisher numbers, methods and exports, (2) describe populations and biology of commercial species, and (3) propose appropriate fisheries management approaches. This paper describes only the first phase of this program.

AB This fishery was examined utilizing public records, stakeholder interviews, and operational site visits to describe the fishery for the Puerto Rico Coral Reef Advisory Committee as a first step toward development of policies for the effective management of these natural resources. The fishery is not large, including fewer than 20 licensed fishers operating primarily on the west end of the island. Only three operators export product, with the remaining fishers providing specimens to the exporters based upon customer orders. Most collection of coral reef species occurs over hard rubble zones mixed with relic reef structures and rock, or on the sides and frontal areas of active reefs. Other species are collected from among mangrove prop root zones, tidal flats, and seagrass beds. Collections are made using simple barrier and dip nets for fish and motile invertebrates such as shrimp. Invertebrates such as crabs, starfish, and sea cucumbers are commonly collected by overturning small rocks, gathering the specimens, and then replacing the rocks in their original positions. Specimens are carried to the boat and transferred to individual cup holders to maximize survival. Although statements concerning former use of chemicals to assist capture were noted, no evidence of current chemical use was observed. Specimens are held in re-circulating seawater systems onshore until collections are aggregated and shipped. The fishery strives to operate with mortality of < 1%, as mortalities of > 3% are described as unacceptable to customers. More than 100 fish species are collected in this fishery, but the top ten species account for > 70% of the total numbers and > 60% of the total value of the fishery, with a single species, Gramma loreto (Royal Gramma), comprising > 40% of the numbers. More than 100 species of invertebrates are collected,but this fishery is also dominated by a handful of species, including anemones, hermit crabs, turbo snails, serpent starfish, and feather duster polychaetes.

AB One of the limitations for reaching sustainable forest development is related to the traffic of machines andvehicles during harvest operations and wood transport, which may cause soil structure degradation. Seeking a way to analyze this problem, the objective of this study was to determine the traffic effects due to harvest operations and wood transport, on the preconsolidation pressure (sigma(p)) in a Typic Acrustox cultivated with eucalyptus. This study was conducted using undisturbed soil samples collected at the 0.10. 125 m depth. Undisturbed soil samples were used in the uniaxial compression tests. Soil sampling consisted of two stages, before and after the mechanized harvest operations. The traffic effects on the sigma(p) in the dry season indicated that the soil compaction process was neither evident nor important. However, in the rainy season the traffic effects on the sigma(p) indicated that the operations performed with Harvester and Forwarder caused greater soil compaction than those with Motorized Saw and Manual, which caused less soil compaction.

AB pH is known to be a primary regulator of nutrient cycling in soil. Increasing soil acidity in agricultural systems has the potential to slow down N cycling and reduce N losses from leaching thereby enhancing sustainability and reducing pollution. We conducted a field experiment to investigate the impact of acidity on N leaching in arable and grassland agricultural systems. The results showed that nitrate (NOT) concentrations in soil water were greater under arable than under grassland. Soil acidification significantly lowered NOT concentrations in soil water over winter and spring under grassland, whilst in cereal plots a similar effect was only observed in spring. Our results suggest that soil acidification decreased nitrification causing an accumulation of NH4+ which was not subject to leaching. Dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) concentrations in soil water were significantly greater under arable than grassland. Soil acidification lowered concentrations of DON in soil water, usually to a greater extent in grassland than in arable plots. It was concluded that it may be possible to use careful soil pH management as a tool to control NOT leaching without compromising the quality of drainage water, and that this may be more effective on grassland than on arable crops.

AB Soil biochemical properties are indicators of soil quality, but there is still no consensus as to how they should be used. We review the trends in their use over the last decade. Generally, biochemical properties related to the biocycles of the elements (C, N, P and S) are used to diagnose soil quality. These properties include both general biochemical parameters (i.e. microbial biomass C, dehydrogenase activity and N mineralization potential) and specific biochemical parameters (i.e. the activity of hydrolytic enzymes, such as phosphatase, urease and P-glucosidase). Biochemical properties can be used both individually, as simple indices, or in combination using complex equations derived from mathematical combinations or the application of statistical programs. The results described in the literature for both are contradictory and question the validity of the use of biochemical properties as quality indicators. Complex expressions, in which different properties are combined, are thought to be highly suitable for estimating soil quality, although their use is limited to the area and situation in which they have been described. Generally, the greatest problems posed by the use of biochemical properties as soil quality indicators include the lack of reference values, the contradictory behaviour shown by these properties when a soil is degraded, and the regional variations in expression levels. Most of these problems are derived from the scarce information available on the biochemical properties of soil. For this reason, obtaining soil quality indicators of general use will require a coordinated effort from the international scientific community to standardise the analytical methods and to compile databases of biochemical properties from soils under diverse geographic conditions and with different uses and management.

ID TILLAGE
AB Within the framework of the SIDASS project, a model to predict soil erosion indicators as a function of soil type and agricultural management was developed. It was based on the WEPP technology and including new components specially related to soil compaction and soil workability. In this paper, new experimental data from the Sevilla area of Spain were obtained from a set of 12 soil erosion micro-plots during the farming year 2000-2001. In a dryland olive crop farm, several representative soil types (Typic Xerochrept, Typic Calcixerept and Aquic Haploxerept) and two different agricultural management: (i) a traditional mouldboard ploughing and secondary tillage and (ii) a reduced tillage with a growing protection crop, were compared. The experimental results show that the protection management system on Xerochrept soils was effective in lowering soil erosion in comparison with traditional system. By using these new measured data, the validation analyses of the SIDASS erosion model replicates the soil erosion indicators very well. It predicted that most of the variation observed could be accounted for by the runoff coefficient (R-2 = 0.92) and the inter-rill erosion (R-2 = 0.97). Therefore, we suggest that the SIDASS erosion model can be used to develop useful recommendations for environmentally sustainable agricultural management systems on at least the soil types evaluated.

AB The SIDASS project "A spatially distributed simulation model predicting the dynamics of agro-physical soil state within Eastern and Western Europe countries for the selection of management practices to prevent soil erosion based on sustainable soil-water interactions" required a method for estimating the dates (or soil water conditions) under which soil tillage operations could be performed. For this purpose, methods were developed for estimating the optimum and the range of soil water contents for tillage. These methods are based on the soil water retention curve. In this paper, we further develop the method in two ways. First, we take account of the fact that the soil properties: clay content, organic matter content and bulk density are not independent. This is done through the use of simple pedo-transfer functions which are based on measurements on many soils. Second, we present a simplified and more rapid method for estimating the lower (dry) limit for tillage. This enables this lower limit to be calculated using a computer spreadsheet instead of through tedious iterative calculations which were previously obtained with a special computer program. Examples are given for the tillage limits which take account of the interdependencies between the contents of clay, the content of organic matter and the bulk density. Estimated typical values of the tillage limits are presented for all the soil texture classes in the FAO/USDA classification system. Additionally, it is shown that the range of water contents for tillage is expected to decrease with decreasing soil physical quality as measured by S. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A model to predict the mechanical strength of arable soils and its effect on physical properties was developed and integrated within the framework of the SIDASS-project "A spatially distributed simulation model predicting the dynamics of agro-physical soil state within Eastern and Western Europe countries for the selection of management practices to prevent soil erosion based on sustainable soil-water interactions".
   The mechanical strength quantification of agricultural or forest soils in order to assess the trafficability or the limitation of mechanical loading at given soil properties are presented. While agricultural engineering approaches are primarily restricted to the definition of stress distribution in relation to machine and tire type, soil scientists try to include in their approach, not only the mechanical strength properties of the soil horizons but also the inter-dependence of the hydraulic and mechanical strength properties. Soil scientists also understand soil genetical processes and are able to predict the consequences of stress applications for current and future soil physical properties. Thus, the present paper analyses the possibilities for applying pedotransfer functions that relate precompression stresses, as measures of soil strength at various scales, to stress effects on physical soil parameters, such as air permeability. It has been proven that multiregression equations can be used to calculate precompression stresses when they are based on physical properties like texture, aggregation, water retention properties, mechanical parameters like cohesion and angle of the internal friction values. This determination can be carried out and applied at various scales. Examples are presented from the 1:1,000,000 soil map for Europe up to the field or farm level (1:5000) as a very detailed scale.
   This method affords the separation of different sensitivity levels of stress application and consequences for a sustainable site management in the future. The proposed method is a useful tool towards fulfilling soil protection laws in Europe in the same way, as it can be used as a decision maker at the local farm level, both with respect to site-specific management strategies and for the machine industry for the development of regions and climate-dependent machinery. It can be also used as an index for landuse restrictions or to define non site-adjusted landuse techniques. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The southeastern United States produces more industrial timber than any other region of the world from a forest base that includes almost one-half of the world's industrial forest plantations. Although current growth rates are substantially lower than in many other forest plantation areas in the world, growth rates exceeding 70 tons/acre/year are biologically possible and financially attractive in the region. Dramatic gains in growth and value became possible as we recognized that intensive plantation silviculture is like agriculture: Both the plant and the soil need to be actively managed to optimize value. Optimizing value starts with planting high-quality seedlings or plantlets from the best families of the right species to a site where competing vegetation has been suppressed and where the soil may have been tilled and/or fertilized to improve early tree growth. In most cases, these treatments will need to be followed by competing vegetation suppression, repeated nutrient additions, thinning, and pruning - treatments that provide needed resources to the appropriate number of quality crop trees. Several challenges remain to implement the silvicultural systems needed to fully realize the potential value of our plantations in a cost-effective and environmentally sustainable manner; however, looking into the future, we see clonal plantations, whole rotation resource management regimes, use of spatially explicit spectral reflectance data as a major information source, active management to minimize insect and disease losses, and more attention to growing wood for specific products.

AB Four examples are investigated for the optimal and sustainable extraction of groundwater from a coastal aquifer under the threat of seawater intrusion. The objectives and constraints of these management scenarios include maximizing the total volume of water pumped, maximizing the profit of selling water, minimizing the operational and water treatment costs, minimizing the salt concentration of the pumped water, and controlling the drawdown limits. The physical model is based on the density-dependent advective-dispersive solute transport model. Genetic algorithm is used as the optimization tool. The models are tested on a hypothetical confined aquifer with four pumping wells located at various depths. These solutions establish the feasibility of simulating various management scenarios under complex three-dimensional flow and transport processes in coastal aquifers for the optimal and sustainable use of groundwater.

AB Coastal zones are the primary interface for the exchange of natural and man-made materials between terrestrial and coastal ecosystems. While continuous industrial development and population growth in the coastal region promote unprecedented economic prosperity, water resource management in bay and estuary areas turns out to be a crucial challenge. Therefore, local, state, and federal water planning groups are attempting to manage the supply of freshwater inflow based on sustainability goals, especially for semi-arid coastal regions like South Texas. Surface and ground water management practices. in this semi-arid coastal region are implemented to ensure an ever-lasting water supply on one hand and to maintain ecosystem integrity in the bay and estuary system on the other hand. The aim of this study is to apply a stochastic compromise programming model to identify a compromise solution under uncertainty in terms of two competing objectives: minimizing freshwater release from a coastal reservoir and maximizing fishery harvest in its associated bay-Corpus Christi Bay, South Texas. The global criterion method used in the solution procedure seeks to select a compromise solution that possesses the shortest distance from a positive ideal solution (PIS) and the farthest distance from a negative ideal solution (NIS). Solutions were found using three distance-based functions in conjunction with stochastic constraints reflecting the risk levels involved in decision-making. Results indicate that current flows in the mouth of the Nueces River are not sufficient to maintain the salinity level and to satisfy harvest requirements in the Corpus Christi Bay if water supply goal in the city has higher priority. Therefore, a sustainable management plan of exploring the structure of demand and supply is highly desirable in this fast growing urban region.

AB Society benefits from rivers in many aspects. To the extent of water resources management, one of the salient issues is that the social benefit of in-stream water quality improvements is often difficult to be quantified for possible cost justification in many water pollution control programs. The difficulties arise from that many service flows of water quality are not channelled through the market system to consumers and producers. With different socio-economic structures, such valuation could be even more challenging when taking river basins with low-income level into account. Recent advances in fuzzy set theory provide a germain insight to viewing the in-stream water quality as a kind of fuzzy resource due to varying awareness of the quality of life. This paper provides a technical analysis using the fuzzy contingent valuation mothod (FCVM) to value in-stream water quality improvements in terms of three fuzzy resources from aesthetic to recreational, and to ecological aspects. Traditional CVM may allow interest groups or affected parties to join and present a more flexible asset assessment with respect to the prescribed environmental features in the river corridor. Yet the FCVM provides a mechanism that lies in providing a mapping (via fuzzy set theory) from a survey of respondents' valuation of subjective assessments of water quality into objective economic measures in terms of water quality parameters that management can more directly manipulate. With this new tool, the traditional CVM assessment outputs in a well-developed river basin may even lead to derive a simular valuaton function in a form of a regression equation in a developing river basin where the incme level is relatively low. As part of the sustainablity analysis basin wide, a case study in Taiwan showed that such effort may provide supportive information for cost benefit analysis in many water pollution control programs corresponding to different temporal and spatial scales.

SO SYSTEMS RESEARCH AND BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE

DT Article
DE transdisciplinarity; sustainable development; organizational learning;
   participatory action research; communicative action
AB In this paper we look at relationships between design, science and deliberation in urban and regional planning. Each of these activities can be used to inform policy, either in isolation or in different forms of combinations. The combinations usually involve hierarchies, which use the framework of one activity to integrate the others. Such hierarchies create an unbalance among the three activities, resulting in a competition for the integration monopoly, and therefore ineffective cooperation. There is a lack of theory that would allow us to combine these three activities in an equivalent way. Based on experiences in the Delft Interfaculty Research Program 'The Ecological City, we propose a transdisciplinary model, which conceives design, science and deliberation as learning processes that follow the same sequence of creative, descriptive and normative steps. From a learning perspective, design, science and deliberation are complementary and can therefore be integrated in a group learning process. The learning model assigns roles to the different activities and supports the planning team in establishing a common orientation and adapting the methods to a common goal. Applications have shown that the transdisciphnary learning model only works if the participants work with articulated methods, if the limitations of these methods are made explicit, and if the participants accept the superiority of common learning over disciplinary rigour, which involves an participants engaging in both an integrating and a serving role.

AB This paper supports the inclusion of Christianity in the European constitution. It does this by analysing the role that an ethical vision plays in sustaining a community and the impact on other critical factors such as ethics, work, management, social structure and education that ensues when vision is undermined. It examines in particular the contribution that the Christian vision has made to communities in the past and the systemic role it can play in ensuring their long-term viability today. The study applies a multi-modal systems framework to analyse the links between the vision and these critical factors and projects that may unfold in communities once they lose their vision.

AB Damage caused by the citrus leafminer (CLM), Phyllocnistis citrella, is highly dependent on the citrus flushing pattern. Chemical control is only required in young trees, both in nurseries and in newly established orchards. However, this situation is completely different in countries where the causal agent of citrus canker, the bacterium Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri exists. CLM infestation results in a higher incidence of citrus canker infection. Among preventive control strategies that provide environmentally sound and sustainable solutions, resistant or tolerant varieties remain the most economical means of insect control. The objective of the present study is to genetically analyse the resistance/ susceptibility to CLM and two other traits that might be related, the deciduous behaviour and leaf area of the tree, in a progeny of citradias derived from the cross between two species with different CLM susceptibility - C. aurantium L. and Poncirus trifoliata - using linkage maps of each parent that include several resistance gene analogues. We detected two antibiosis and six antixenosis putative quantitative trait loci (QTLs) in a random sample of forty-two of those citradias. An important antibiosis QTL (R-2 = 18.8 - 26.7%) affecting both percentage of infested leaves and number of pupal casts per leaf has been detected in P. trifoliata linkage group Pa7, which is in agreement with the CLM antibiotic character shown by this species, and independent from any segregating QTL involved in its deciduous behaviour. The maximum value for the Kruskal-Wallis statistic of the other putative antibiosis QTL coincides with marker S2-AS4_800 in sour orange linkage map. Given that the sequence of this marker is highly similar to several nucleotide binding site-leucine-rich repeat (NBS-LRR)-type resistance genes, it might be considered as a candidate gene for insect resistance in citrus.

AB Practical tools are needed to identify and advance sustainable management practices to optimize economic return, conserve soil, and minimize negative off-site environmental effects. The objective of this article is to review current research in non-saline soils of the central U.S. to consider bulk soil electrical conductivity (ECa) as an assessment tool for: (1) tracking N dynamics, (2) identifying management zones, (3) monitoring soil quality trends, and (4) designing and evaluating field-scale experiments. The interpretation and utility of ECa are highly location and soil specific; soil properties contributing to measured ECa must be clearly understood. In soils where ECa is driven by NO3-N, ECa has been used to track spatial and temporal variations in crop-available N (manure, compost, commercial fertilizer and cover crop treatments) and rapidly assess N mineralization early in the growing season to calculate fertilizer rates for site-specific management (SSM). Selection of appropriate ECa sensors (direct contact, electromagnetic induction, or time domain reflectometry) may improve sensitivity to N fluctuations at specific soil depths. In a dryland cropping system where clay content dominates measured ECa, ECa-based management zones delineated soil productivity characteristics and crop yields. These results provided a framework effective for SSM, monitoring management-induced trends in soil quality, and appraising and statistically evaluating field-scale experiments. Use of ECa may foster a large-scale systems approach to research that encourages farmer involvement. Additional research is needed to investigate the interactive effects of soil, weather, and management on ECa as an assessment tool, and the geographic extent to which specific applications of this technology can be applied.

AB Entomological surveys were carried out in the town of Mbalmayo and in the nearby rural village of Olama, within the equatorial forest zone of Cameroon. Mosquitoes were captured when landing on human volunteers and by pyrethrum spray catches. Malaria vectors captured were Anopheles gambiae Giles (M and S forms) and A. moucheti Evans in both areas, together with A. funestus Giles in Mbalmayo. One A. marshallii (Theobald) specimen infected by Plasmodium falciparum was found in Olama. Anopheles moucheti was the most abundant anopheline species caught in Olama, while A. gambiae was the most abundant in Mbalmayo. All these vectors were highly anthropophilic as indicated by the fact that only 5 of 201 blood meats analysed had been taken from non-human hosts. Plasmodium falciparum was the only malaria parasite species found in Mbalmayo, white P malariae was also found in Olama. The annual entomological inoculation rate was estimated at 129 infective bites/person/year in Mbalmayo and 322 in Olama. Comparison with data published in 1955 from Mbalmayo, before expansion of the town, showed the impact of urbanization on the composition of the vector system and malaria transmission dynamics. Such changes should be considered when implementing sustainable control measures. (c) 2004 Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE integrated planning; sustainable accessibility; urban transport
AB The integration of transport and land use planning is widely recognized as essential to the achievement of sustainable development. The concept of accessibility-or what and how can be reached from a given point in space-can provide a useful conceptual framework for this integration. More specifically, a shift of focus in urban transport planning from catering for mobility to catering for accessibility helps see how more sustainable transport options can, under certain land use conditions, provide a competitive degree of accessibility that matches less sustainable options. The authors have used the concept of accessibility as a framework for the interactive design of integrated transport and land use plans in two areas of the Netherlands. The objective of these exercises was identifying solutions where economic, social, and environmental goals could be combined, defined as the achievement of 'sustainable accessibility'. The existing situation has been evaluated, and alternative plans have been developed. In this paper we reflect on these experiences and sketch the way forward, with a focus on the methodological aspects of the undertaking. In this respect, a major challenge is finding a workable balance between an accessibility measure that is theoretically and empirically sound and one that is sufficiently plain to be usefully employed in interactive, creative plan-making processes.

ID STABILIZATION
AB The paper reports on the development of UK transport targets for CO2 emissions for 2050. Five key studies containing future carbon emissions scenarios for the UK were used to establish targets for overall reductions in emissions to achieve stabilisation at 550 and 450 ppm of atmospheric CO2. Two approaches were used to consider the proportion of total emissions that would be attributable to transport in the future: 26% of total emissions as now and an increase to 41% of total emissions in line with forecasts. The overall targets and expected contributions from transport were used to derive target emissions for the transport sector to be achieved by 2050, which ranged from 8.2 to 25.8 MtC. Even the weakest of these targets represents a considerable reduction from current emissions levels. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study presents the comparison between global emission mitigation strategies (GEMS) and local emission mitigation strategies (LEMS) and their potential in controlling the non-target pollutants/emissions in concurrence with their economic performance. Comparative analysis revealed that strategies targeted at the mitigation of local pollution like total suspended particulate matter (TSP) and hydrocarbons (HC) also shows greater potential in reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions (as non-target emission). In GEMS, 20% CO2 reduction resulted in 14.9% reduction in TSP emission. In LEMS with a 20% TSP reduction, CO2 emission reduction was found to be 15.2%. TSP mitigation strategy not only performed well with non-target global emission but also within local emissions with SO, reduction much higher than that of target pollutant (TSP itself). The HC mitigation strategy was found to be under-performing with most of the non-target pollutants lying far below the target pollutant reduction.
   The total cost of transportation is found to be in a similar and smaller band across all strategies (both GEMS and LEMS). The HC mitigation strategy resulted in the least cost followed by the CO2 and TSP strategies. TSP strategy of emission reduction while planning the transportation system for a longer period was found more effective than GHG mitigation strategy. Therefore, employing local pollutant mitigation strategies in transportation planning would also cater for the needs of GHG mitigation, which is a key factor in attracting international funding organizations to invest in transport infrastructure development in developing countries. It would also provide equal consensus from local policy makers, environmental activist and also global actors. This presents a base for the argument that the transportation projects need to be looked at in pollution mitigation approach rather than the GHG mitigation approach. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper draws on primary research undertaken in the North East of England (NE) to explore the importance of private transport in allowing women to access employment. It outlines the evidence base which exists to consider the impact of mobility on social exclusion. It then analyses the links between women, transport and the labour market, women's transport choices, and the relationship between women's access to private transport and their employment position. It concludes by arguing that access to private transport is a key factor in determining women's economic inclusion, and that the development of sustainable transport systems may have serious gender implications.

AB The urban environment and modes of transport are increasingly being linked to physical activity participation and population health outcomes. Much of the research has been based on either health or urban design paradigms, rather than from collaborative approaches. Previous health reviews in the urban design area have been constrained to perceptions of the neighborhood or walking behaviors, consequently limiting the understanding of built environment influences on physical activity modalities. This review focuses on existing evidence surrounding various urban design factors and physical activity behaviors. Based on the available evidence, fostering suitable urban environments is critical to sustaining physical activity behaviors. In turn, these environments will provide part of the solution to improving population health outcomes. Key urban design features attributable to transport-related physical activity are density, subdivision age, street connectivity, and mixed land use. Future directions for research include consistent use of transport and health measurement tools, an enhanced understanding of traffic calming measures, and further collaborative work between the health, transport, and urban design sectors. Presenting these findings to transport and urban design audiences may influence future practice, thereby increasing the sustainability of health-related physical activity at the population level.

AB This paper describes a study on the sustainability of Community-based Animal Health Worker (CAHW) services in Mwingi District, Kenya. These services began in 1992 and were supported by the District Veterinary Authority (DVA) with assistance from the Integrated Food Security Programme-Eastern (IFSP-E). Over time and using a process of participatory reviews with multiple stakeholders, the system evolved into a network of CAHWs. The study focused on CAHWs' service sustainability and their relationships with other animal health service providers. A mutually beneficial and supportive arrangement existed between the CAHWs and Animal Health Assistants (AHAs), based on a private drug supply system, referral and backstopping support. The CAHWs derived sufficient income from their veterinary work to maintain their interest in the system. Seventy per cent of CAHWs were continuing to offer adequate animal health services 3 years or more after their initial training and the withdrawal of donor support. Ninety-five per cent of sampled CAHWs (n = 40) viewed their business as successful and expanding. Considering the agro-ecological and socio-economic conditions of the district, the CAHW system can be viewed as an initial stage in the process of extending quality private sector veterinary services.

AB This study aims to determine the safe and sustainable yields for the Sandy Complex aquifer system in Ergene River basin in northwestern Turkey. A numerical ground-water flow model was developed for the Sandy Complex aquifer, which is the most productive and the most widespread aquifer in the basin. The finite difference ground-water model was used to simulate steady and unsteady flow in the aquifer. The model was calibrated in two steps: a steady-state calibration, by using the observed ground-water levels of January 1970; then a transient calibration, by using the observed ground-water levels for the period of January 1970 and December 2000.
   The resulting model was used to develop ground-water pumping scenarios in order to predict the changes in the aquifer system under a set of different pumpage conditions for a planning period of 30 years between January 2001 and December 2030. A total of eight pumping scenarios were developed under transient-flow conditions for the planning period, and the results were evaluated to determine the safe and sustainable yields of the aquifer. The results, presented in the form of a trade-off curve, demonstrate that both the safe and the sustainable yield values are exceeded if pumping continues at the present rate. An appropriate suite of management policies and plans are provided that will promote the sustainable development of the aquifer system.

AB Background. A fracture occurring in osteoporosis is a sentinel event but very rarely leads to bone mineral density (BMD) measurement or sufficient drug therapy. We designed an algorithm to evaluate BMD in older fracture patients and tested it for sustainability as well as acceptance among trauma/orthopedic surgeons.
   Methods. For a 1-year period a prospective BMD test was carried out in women older than 50 and men older than 75 years of age with fractures. The commencement and conduction of therapy during the initial hospital stay and rehabilitation were also analyzed.
   Results. From 228 members of the eligible age groups, 169 patients (74.1%) underwent BMD measurement. According to the WHO definition 71.6% showed reduced BMD in terms of osteoporosis and 24.3% in terms of osteopenia. In 84% therapy was started during initial hospital stay in 74.4% conducted during rehabilitation.
   Conclusions. The vast majority of older patients exhibited reduced BMD as a substantial underlying cause of their fracture. A standardized clinical plan can help to identify and treat most patients with fragility fractures.

DE Eisenia foetida; fly ash; heavy metals; vermicomposting
AB Vermicomposting of fly ash has been attempted, using red earthworm, Eisenia foetida. Fly ash, which was obtained from thermal power station, was mixed with cowdung in different proportions (20, 40, 60 and 80%). These mixtures were used as feed for earthworms, and after 30 days, vermicast recovery, worm zoomass and numbers of juveniles produced were recorded. A total of six runs each of 30 days were conducted during the whole study. Concentrations of heavy metals in different mixtures of fly ash-cowdung, before and after vermicomposting and in the earthworms used in the study were also estimated. Results show maximum output of vermicasts and maximum number of juveniles produced was in reactors with 40% fly ash while maximum weight gain by earthworm was in 20% fly ash vermireactors. Performance of vermireactors up to 60% fly ash was more or less similar but at 80% fly ash, there is a marked reduction in overall performance of the reactors. Chemical analysis of different samples of fly ash-cowdung mixtures prior to vermicomposting revealed high concentrations of zinc, chromium, lead, nickel and copper. Chemical analysis of vermicomposted samples showed 30-50% reduction in heavy metals up to 60% fly ash and 10-30% reduction in 80% fly ash. Metal analysis of earthworms revealed considerable bioaccumulation of heavy metals in their body. The Present study indicates the feasibility of E. foetida for mitigating the toxicity of metals and up to 60% fly ash-cowdung mixtures can be used for sustainable and efficient vermicomposting.

AB Functional roles of Schoenoplectus californicus, giant bulrush, were evaluated in an 3.2 ha (8-acre) constructed wetland treatment system receiving copper-contaminated water. The constructed wetland used in this research was designed to decrease bioavailable copper concentrations in a wastestream and eliminate associated toxicity to downstream biota by exploiting the thermodynamic processes responsible for copper speciation. This was achieved by integrating carbon, sulfur and copper biogeochemical cycles. In this system, S. californicus, which represents an integral part of the carbon cycle, provides a physical, chemical and biological role in removing metals from the aqueous phase. The specific contributions of S. californicus in this system are to provide a sustainable carbon source for removal of copper by (1) provision of an organic ligand for sorption of copper entering the system, (2) production of organic ligands through growth of S. californicus, (3) accretion of organic ligands over time due to decomposition of S. californicus detritus, and (4) use of organic carbon as an energy source for dissimilatory sulfate production. Shoots and roots of viable S. californicus sorbed 0.88% and 5.88%, respectively, of copper entering the system. The half-life of S. californicus detritus in the constructed wetland system was approximately 184 d, indicating that sufficient detritus will accrete over time, providing binding sites for copper and an energy source for bacterial metabolic processes that contribute to copper immobilization in wetland systems.

AB Characterizing the long-term effect of agricultural management systems on weed communities will aid in developing sustainable weed management practices. Weed seedbanks and aboveground biomass were measured within a corn-soybean-wheat crop sequence from 1990 through 2002 at Hickory Corners, MI. Four management systems were compared: conventional (CONV; full rates of N fertilizer and herbicides, moldboard tillage), no till (NT; same as CONV with no primary tillage), reduced input (RI; reduced rates of N fertilizer and herbicides, moldboard tillage, mechanical weed control, wheat underseeded with red clover), and organic (ORG; same as RI but no synthetic inputs). Multivariate ordinations of weed seedbanks showed a divergence of the CONV and NT systems from the RI and ORG systems. The CONV and NT seedbanks were dominated by grass species (mainly fall panicum and large crabgrass), whereas the RI and ORG systems were dominated by common lambsquarters and common chickweed. Within a single growing season, weed seedbanks in the RI and ORG systems were positively correlated with weed biomass whereas seedbanks in the CONV and NT system had little predictive value. Weed biomass from 1990 through 2002 showed a strong association of grass weed species with the corn phase of the CONV and NT system and common lambsquarters and redroot pigweed with the corn and soybean phases of the RI and ORG systems. Weed biomass diversity measures were negatively correlated with soybean yields in RI and ORG and wheat yields in NT, RI, and ORG. It is not clear whether crops were less competitive in the NT, RI, and ORG treatments, allowing new weed species to enter the plots, or whether less effective weed management in the NT, RI, and ORG treatments resulted in increased species richness, causing reduced crop yields. Mechanistic studies are needed to elucidate the relationship between weed community diversity and crop performance.

AB Developing ecological principles applicable to invasive plant management is central to implementing sustainable strategies. We tested portions of a potentially useful successional-based management framework to further our understanding of the relationship between disturbance and colonization during revegetation of invasive weed-dominated grasslands. We hypothesized (1) intermediate wheatgrass density and biomass would be greatest at highest seeding rates, (2) control and tillage procedures that increase the availability of safe sites would increase wheatgrass abundance, and (3) spotted knapweed density and biomass would be lowest in treatments with highest wheatgrass density and biomass. Treatments included three disturbance levels: (1) no disturbance, (2) application of glyphosate, and (3) fall tillage. Colonization treatments were seeding intermediate wheatgrass of 0, 500, 2,500, and 2. Treatments were factorially applied in a randomized complete-block design with four replications at each of two sites located in Montana. Density and biomass of intermediate wheatgrass and spotted knapweed were sampled in 1997 and 2001. At both sites, seeding 2,500 or 12,500 seed m(-2) increased wheatgrass density over that of the nonseeded control in 1997. The highest seeding rate produced almost three times as many wheatgrass plants as 2,500 seeds m(-2) that year. By 2001, only the highest seeding rate produced wheatgrass densities greater than that of the nonseeded control at Bozeman. Seeding rates higher than 500 seeds m(-2) yielded greater wheatgrass biomass than the nonseeded control with or without either tillage or glyphosate. At the highest seeding rate, tillage or glyphosate doubled intermediate wheatgrass biomass compared with no disturbance. Spotted knapweed generally had lower biomass where intermediate wheatgrass density and biomass was highest. One approach to rehabilitation is to design disturbances that favor desired species and then use high seeding rates that overwhelm the pool of available propagules and occupy a high percentage of safe sites.

TI Pension reform in Germany and Austria: System change vs. quantitative
   retrenchment
SO WEST EUROPEAN POLITICS
LA English
DT Article
AB This article first outlines the differences in outcome of pension reform in Germany and Austria. The 2001 German pension reform cut benefits very little, but it started a system changing transformation process by strengthening the second ( occupational pensions) and third pillar ( private pensions). The 2003 Austrian pension reform, pushed through against major opposition from the labour unions, contains very few elements of policy innovation, but benefits have been cut back much more significantly than in the German case. The paper explains the difference in outcomes ( system change in Germany, retrenchment in Austria) by looking at the structure of political institutions. The federal government in Austria is much less constrained by formal veto players than the German government, which had to engage in extensive coalition-building to get the pension bill through the second chamber of parliament. Therefore the influence of informal veto players ( mainly unions) was much higher in Germany. The impact on the reform outcome was the positive discrimination of occupational pensions and less severe cuts in the benefit levels. The concluding thesis is that for successful and long-term sustainable welfare state reform, a small number of formal veto players is a valuable resource. A large number of formal veto players is an obstacle to retrenchment reforms, although it might encourage policy innovation, because political actors will look for other policy venues to increase their leverage.

AB The recent decline in Mexico's maquiladora sector provides an opportunity to reassess the sustainability of basing national economic competitiveness on low wages. (1) Focusing on human capital as an important component of equitable growth, the authors argue that models of its development which consider market factors alone are inadequate. Combining their own case study with a review of other studies over the past 20 years, the authors propose a "management-centered" (as opposed to a "market-centered") model of human capital development as a basis for discussing the relative merits of in-bond industrial programs and considering measures to improve levels of human capital.

AB The increasing availability and importance of electronic publications presents a new challenge to the current system of permanent archival storage and maintenance which in Germany has been ensured by the legal provisions for mandatory deposit at the federal and state level. This article provides a survey of the efforts of Die Deutsche Bibliothek and the regional depository libraries to create a legal basis which will take into account the changes in the publishing world and of the current status of the corresponding stipulations in Germany. At the same time the author addresses the unresolved questions which go beyond the legal situation and are essential aspects in the creation of a new, sustainable infrastructure for establishing a digital archival system.

AB It is impossible to ignore the increased trend toward electronic publishing in the internet, in particular within the framework of academic exchange and the publication of scientific information. Hence the question is becoming increasingly important as to how those libraries, which have the legal deposit in their respective regions and are required to collect, catalogue and preserve these items, plan to proceed. In view of the dimensions involved, it is the obvious choice to cooperate and divide up the various tasks among participating members. The article takes into account the activities of a task-group established by the Cooperative Committee of Regional Libraries within Section 4 of the German Library Association and Die Deutsche Bibliothek and concentrates on an important prerequisite, namely the technical synchronisation and preliminary preparation of relevant metadata and other objects in a defined and sustainable exchange format.

AB Mortality is high in zoo-housed black rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis), and the reproductive rates of captive white rhinoceros (Ceratotherium simum) are unsustainably low. To determine the possible role of stress in the causation of these problems, we analyzed weekly fecal samples collected for I year from black (10 males and 16 females) and white (six males and 13 females) rhinoceroses at 16 zoos for corticoid metabolite concentrations. Fecal corticoid profiles were examined in relation to behavior as rated by keepers in a questionnaire, luteal phase ovarian cycles of females (Brown et al., 2001), and socioenvironmental factors. We compared individual fecal corticoid profiles by examining hormone means and variability (i.e., standard deviation (SD) and coefficient of variation (CV)). For the black rhinos, higher mean corticoid concentrations were found at zoos where rhinos were maintained in enclosures that were exposed to the public around a greater portion of the perimeter. Higher variability in corticoid excretion was correlated with higher rates of fighting between breeding partners and higher institutional mortality rates. Black rhino pairs that were kept separated exhibited lower corticoid variability and less fighting activity when they were introduced during female estrous periods compared to pairs that were kept together every day. For white rhinos, significantly lower mean corticoids were found for individuals that rated higher on "friendliness to keeper." Higher corticoid variability was found in noncycling as compared to cycling white rhino females. Noncycling females exhibited higher rates of stereotypic pacing and lower frequencies of olfactory behaviors. Interindividual differences in mean corticoids in both species appeared to be related to responsiveness to humans, whereas corticoid variability was related to intraspecific social relationships. More importantly, high corticoid variability appeared to be an indicator of chronic or "bad" stress, because of its association with potentially deleterious consequences in each species (i.e., fighting and mortality (black rhino), and reproductive acyclicity (white rhino)). Our results provide evidence that social stressors may cause chronic stress in black and white rhinos, and that this contributes to the captive-population sustainability problems observed in each species.

Grain yield and water-use efficiency (WUE: grain yield per unit of water consumed) trends, and changes in soil properties during a 24-year fertilization experiment in Pingliang, Gansu, China, were recorded. Mean yields of wheat for the 16 years started in 1981 ranged from 1.29 t ha(-1) for the unfertilized plots (CK) to 4.71 t ha(-1) for the plots that received manure (M) annually with inorganic nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fertilizers (MNP). Corn yields for the 6 years started in 1979 averaged 2.29 and 5.61 t ha(-1) in the same treatments. Yields and WUEs declined significantly with lapse of time except CK and MNP for wheat. Wheat yields with the N and M declined at rate of 77 and 81 kg ha(-1) year(-1), but the decline of 57 kg ha(-1) year(-1) for NP was similar to that of 61 ha(-1) year(-1) for straw with N annually and P every second year (SNP). Likewise, the corn yields and WUEs declined from 160 to 250 kg ha(-1) year(-1) and from 0.01 to 0.03 kg m(-3) year(-1) among treatments, respectively. These declines were likely to loss of soil fertility and gradual dry weather. Yields were significantly correlated with seasonal evapotranspiration with slopes ranging from 0.5 to 1.27 kg m(-3) for wheat and from 1.15 to 2.03 kg m(-3) for corn. Soil organic carbon (SOC), total N (TN), and total P (TP) gradually built up with time except the CK, in which TN and TP remained unchanged but SOC and available P (AP) decreased. Soil AP decreased in the N. Soil available K declined rapidly without straw or manure. Balanced fertilization should be encouraged to ensure sustainable productivity in this intensive cropping system. The greatest SOC increases of about 160 mg ha(-1) year(-1) occurred in the SNP and MNP, suggesting that long-term additions of organic materials to soil could increase soil water-holding capacity which, in return, improves water availability to plants and arrests yield declines, and decrease CO2 emission from agricultural soils and sustain land productivity.

AB The replacement of perennial grass species by undesirable annual grass weeds not only results in lower productivity but also contributes to a range of external costs. In particular, shallow rooted annuals result in greater deep drainage and therefore a greater potential for development of salinity and acidity, and greater volumes of runoff of poor quality water to streams. In this paper an economic framework for examining the sustainability issues of a perennial grazing system on the New South Wales Central Tablelands, Australia, is presented. This involves a combination of simulation and dynamic programming models, with the state of the system represented by variables for the perennial grass composition and soil fertility. The paper examines a range of management strategies that increase the perennial grass composition in terms of net income from grazing, and the impact upon the externalities. The paper determined that economic benefits are derived from the adoption of a grazing rest technology that increased the optimal level of perennial grass composition. There were also associated reductions in deep drainage, runoff and soil loss with this increase in perennial grass composition. However, the imposition of policy options aimed at reducing the external costs associated with grazing management did not influence the optimal grazing decisions. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB The spatial and temporal changes of land use, cropping patterns and cattle keeping were assessed for the period 1961-1999 in Kyamtwara division, Bukoba district, Tanzania. The assessment was based on interpreting aerial photographs, surveys and a review of historical statistical data. The area of grassland declined by 40% with a concomitant increase in annual crop fields and forest of 225 and 36%, respectively. The cropping pattern changed from a predominance of banana/coffee/beans to a complex mixed cropping of banana/coffee/beans/maize and root crops in the homegarden, and increased cultivation of maize and root crops in pure stands. Farmers stopped cultivating sorghum and finger millet. The population of indigenous cattle decreased by 50% and an equal percentage of dairy cattle was introduced, but cattle-owning households decreased by 85%. Nutrient balances of homegardens ranged between -27 and 17 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), - 1 and 7 kg P ha(-1) yr(-1) and -5 and 12 kg K ha(-1) yr(-1), with the positive balances achieved by resource-rich households. Nutrient balances of crops in pure stand ranged between -15 and -2 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), -2 and - 1 kg P ha(-1) yr(-1) and - 14 and - 1 kg K ha(-1) yr(-1), with more negative balances observed with maize, implying that soil nutrient stocks are decreasing. Increasing population density, coupled with an unequal distribution of resources among households, land tenure, economic policies and poor crop markets were identified as major causal factors of the above changes. Reversing soil fertility decline requires external inputs of nutrients. Within the current poor economic situation of the farming community, different potential soil fertility improvement strategies, including exploitation of N-2-fixing legumes are discussed.

AB Tropical African yambean (Sphenostylis stenocarpa L) is an under-utilised hardy, protein-rich legume. Antinutrients and the excessively long cooking time (4-6 h), among other factors, limit the food use of African yambean seeds. To reduce these limitations, non-traditional, less energy-consuming processing methods are required. Seeds of different varieties were (i) examined for ingredients and (ii) fermented with Lactobacillus plantarum. Comparisons with traditionally cooked beans were made. Protein content and in vitro protein digestibility were increased slightly by fermentation or cooking. Reductions in trypsin and a-amylase inhibitor activity and tannin ranged from significant to complete. The contents of potentially very toxic cyanogenic glycosides and flatulence-causing alpha-galactosides were high in raw beans. Reduction by fermentation (by 85%) was clearly more effective than by traditional cooking (10-20%). The results demonstrate (i) that fermentation can substantially improve the nutritional quality and (ii) that the energy requirement to produce a basic consumable fermented food from African yambean is only 10% of that of traditional cooking. On these grounds, widespread application of lactic acid fermentation by individuals or small-scale industries would be advantageous in the context of small-household economy, environmental protection, health and long-term sustainable agriculture in Nigeria.

AB This paper describes the physical nature of the Tongass National Forest, its salient natural resources, the social and economic importance of the resources, the complexity of the land management planning process, the chronology of the plan development, and the structure and function of the Pacific Northwest Research Station and Tongass National Forest planning partnership. Three features of the planning process were unique to the revision of the Tongass National Forest plan. First, a major goal was to produce a landscape-scale plan for long-term resource sustainability. Second, the 23-person planning team included six research scientists as full members. Finally, an agreement was reached between the Pacific Northwest Research Station and the Tongass National Forest to collaborate and obtain high-priority information needed for the next planning cycle. Benefits accrued to the Pacific Northwest Research Station by demonstrating the relevance of sound science in successful forest planning. Benefits also accrued to the USDA Forest Service Alaska Region in more informed, credible, and defensible decisions. Finally, benefits accrued at the national level when the process of conducting a science consistency check was incorporated into the regulations for forest planning.

AB After 6 years of intensive study, all the research studies designed to answer the information needs identified in appendix B of the Tongass land management plan have ended, with their results published or in press. The knowledge generated from these studies not only informs the ongoing process of regional natural resource management in southeast Alaska, but also helped to define future directions for research. Topics still needing additional study include issues related to wildlife, aquatic systems and salmon habitat, silvicultural options for forest management, wood products utilization, and social science. The role of science in supporting the development of options for natural resource management of the Tongass National Forest was carefully defined and implemented in order to maintain science objectivity and impartiality. The planning processes in southeast Alaska clearly exemplify a clear example of the recognition that natural resource plans need to be founded on the best available science. The complexity of ecosystems, including the scales at which they are organized and operate, require focused research to answer key questions in tandem with management decisions. Managers want the support of science institutions to bolster the effectiveness, predictability, and credibility of their decisions. The integration of science into the decision making process is far more prevalent today than it once was and will increase in the future as we move to refine management decisions based on a continually increasing body of science on which to base those decisions.

AB Geographically distinct strains of the heterotrophic dinoflagellate Pfiesteria shumwayae were cultivated on a fish cell line in the apparent absence of bacteria and other microbial contaminants. Cultures were established with a high rate of success by inoculating single purified P. shumwayae cells into fish cell cultures containing a simple saltwater medium suitable for both cell types, and resulting isolates were serially cultivated on fish cells for months without visible signs of abnormality or reduced viability. P. shumwayae fed phagocytically on the fish cells and exhibited higher cell production than reported using other culturing methods. Compared to previous methods of studying the interaction between Pfiesteria spp. and fishes, this system enabled closer and more direct observation of the dinoflagellates and was also more economical and sustainable as a culturing method. The absence of bacteria and other contaminating microorganisms should facilitate important physiological and biochemical investigations. The methods used were inadequate for cultivating strains of P. piscicida, suggesting a possible difference in nutritional requirements between the 2 Pfiesteria species.

ID ECOLOGY; SCALE
AB Studying human impact on ecological communities may require monitoring of wildlife communities on many spatial scales. Monitoring based on early and sensitive indicators of ecological change can be used administratively in ensuring the sustainability of populations. Wildlife richness is a multispecies concept which describes a general change in the abundance of an assemblage of wildlife species with reference to time and space. This is measured with the wildlife richness index (WRI), which is a sum of changes in the abundance of individual wildlife species. In this study, we present the administrative background of the needs for developing the multispecies monitoring. In order to meet the administrative need for ecological information, we introduce several applications, which are based on the interplay between the wildlife triangle scheme (WTS) and the concept of the WRI. In addition, we illustrate the usability of these applications with wildlife triangle data.

AB Frequentist statistics is not well adapted to handling uncertainties inherent in managing natural resources. A frequentist approach typically involves estimating unknown parameters of ecosystem relationships and testing their statistical significance. While such information is useful, natural resource managers have a greater need to know the most likely current state of an ecosystem and whether particular management actions improve that state in cases where it is not sustainable. Bayesian inference overcomes many of the deficiencies of frequentist statistics and is particularly well suited for implementing adaptive management (AM). Passive and active AM are distinguished and a Bayesian approach to active AM in static and dynamic settings is described for a hypothetical decision problem. The problem is deciding whether or not imposing restrictions on road density and use (referred to as road policy) in northwest Montana's Flathead National Forest improves habitat for the threatened grizzly bear. The proposed Bayesian approach to this decision problem specifies competing hypotheses about the effects of road policy on habitat suitability and evaluates those hypotheses using Bayes theorem and Bayes action.

AB The communal areas of the semi-arid (200 mm) winter-rainfall Namaqualand region of South Africa are heavily utilised by a large number of subsistence farmers who keep sheep and goats. For several decades, farmers have maintained, on average, more than twice the number of animals on the rangeland than the number recommended by the Department of Agriculture for neighbouring commercial enterprises. As a result of the continuous high stocking densities, significant changes in the vegetation have taken place. Farmers are now heavily reliant on an annual flush of vegetation following winter rains to keep their livestock alive. Using a combination of empirical data and consensus agreement, a computer model is developed to describe the long-term climate, livestock and vegetation interactions on the communal rangelands and to investigate the impacts of a range of management strategies. The model suggests that the system (including livestock) is sustainable although not stable, and that its sustainability could be due to climatic variability. The model supports the view that when livestock numbers vary in a manner consistent with recorded observations herbivory has little long-term impact on productivity of the system. This supports recent views of rangelands in semi-arid and and environments where non-equilibrium conditions are thought to dominate ecosystem processes. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID ARABICA COFFEE
AB After the reunion of North and South Vietnam in 1975, the area under small-holder, irrigated cultivation of Coffea canephora increased by a factor of 10 in the Central Highlands. The actual acreage under coffee in Dak Lak province is estimated to be over 260,000 ha, representing 60% of the national production, with 405,000 t per year for the world market. Vietnam is presently the second largest exporter worldwide and expansion is still going on. In response to farmers' alarming reports of apparent water scarcity in the dry season, this paper assesses the groundwater recharge in the Ea Tul watershed, a representative area in the Central Highlands region. The groundwater recharge is estimated by means of a steady-state, water balance model and validated by means of historical data, stream gauge records at the basin's outlet and groundwater level fluctuations in wells nearby the study area. To account for the variability from one year to another, the input of the water balance equation was subjected to a frequency analysis. The estimates indicate that the expected annual groundwater recharge is 743 mm in a wet year, 517 mm in an average and 361 mm in a dry year. Validation and literature reviews confirm these figures. Subsequently the model is used to evaluate the issue of aquifer depletion and to verify whether a combination of optimal irrigation management and optimal land allocation for Robusta coffee could solve the apparent water shortages in the coffee sector. Allowing for a minimum river discharge under very dry circumstances (i.e. the Q(90) of river base flow), the sustainable yield from the aquifer for variable climatic conditions is calculated. The results confirm that with the present irrigation application depths, the groundwater is likely to be depleted in dry years, but not in wet and average years. Reducing the irrigation application depths could keep the groundwater balance positive in all years. Optimization of land allocation for C canephora may offer an alternative way out. A reduction by 35% of the present coffee area in Ea Tul along with irrigation efficiency improvement could keep the groundwater resources in balance and guarantees a minimum river discharge, even during severe dry seasons.

AB Viewing primary care as merely one of the many niches in individual patient care fosters a narrow perspective that neither accounts for the full value of primary care nor offers proper guidance for reforming it. Instead, a systems view better articulates primary care's essential role in increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of other health care services. Primary care improves health care system functioning through such services as managing and triaging undifferentiated symptoms, matching patient needs to health care resources, and enhancing the system's ability to adapt to new circumstances. By acting as an appropriate filter for high-technology care, primary care helps ensure that it is appropriately applied, a major determinant of outcomes. Furthermore, because primary care is the most financially and geographically accessible arm of the health care system, it reduces socioeconomic and geographic disparities across the population. Even in the de facto health system that exists in the United States, these functions are necessary for the efficient, equitable, and sustainable delivery of health care and the adaptability and resilience of the system as a whole. As primary care reforms proceed, it will be important to explicitly consider how to support and strengthen its system-level benefits. Needed reforms include enabling universal access to primary care and providing the leadership, training, and infrastructure support to improve its performance as a central hub in the network of patients, clinicians, and communities. It is important that health systems realize the essential integrative function of primary care.

In this work, ultrasound-induced radical polymerizations of methyl methacrylate (MMA) have been performed in CO2-expanded MMA in order to reduce the viscosity of the reaction mixture. For this purpose, the phase behavior of CO2/MMA systems has been determined. With temperature oscillation calorimetry, the influence of CO2 on the viscosity and on the reaction kinetics of ultrasound-induced polymerizations of MMA has been studied. In contrast to polymerizations in bulk, this technique shows that a low viscosity is maintained during polymerization reactions in CO2-expanded MMA. As a consequence, a constant or even increasing polymerization rate is observed when pressurized CO2 is applied. Moreover, the ultrasound-induced polymer scission in CO2-expanded MMA is demonstrated, which appears to be a highly controlled process. Finally, a preliminary sustainable process design is presented for the production of 10 kg/h pure PMMA (specialty product) in CO2-expanded MMA by ultrasound-induced initiation.

AB A major challenge for forest managers is to define the optimal cutting cycle to ensure that the resource is sustained in the long term. Matrix models of forest dynamics allow time-projection of diameter-class distributions and thus assessment of the time needed, after logging, to recover a given part of the exploitable stock. They are easy to build and they only require, as input variables, the diameter structure of the population(s) under scope. However, such models are based on a coarse description of tree population dynamics and must be used with caution. In particular, as trees are only described from a diameter threshold (usually 10 cm dbh), recruitment of a new tree cannot be linked with the preceding generation since too much time elapsed between seed dispersal and the installation of a 10-cm recruit. This causes predictions of matrix models to be highly questionable in the long term when ingrowth to larger dbh classes greatly depends on the way recruitment has been modelled.
   We used a case study from French Guiana to test whether or not a simple matrix model is reliable enough to help forest managers choose between management alternatives. We focused on the major timber species Dicorynia guianensis Amshoff (Caesalpiniaceae) harvested under a selective cutting regime. We compared predictions of D. guianensis stock recovery in the short and long term provided by two models: StoMat, a non-regulated matrix model, and SELVA, a single-tree distance dependent model explicitly simulating the entire species life cycle. Both models were independently calibrated on data from Paracou permanent sample plots.
   We showed that: (i) the short-term recovery of the exploitable stock predicted by StoMat is reliable for a large range of disturbance conditions; (ii) recruitment implementation in StoMat does not influence projections until the third felling cycle; (iii) for shared initial stand conditions SELVA and StoMat give consistent mid- and long-term predictions: the simple recruitment model used into StoMat could efficiently summarise the regeneration processes of the species under low felling intensity. Our results indicate that the current felling regime used in French Guiana may not be sustainable on a long-term basis. In any case, no more than 60% of the initial stock would be recovered after logging.
   We conclude that simple models can provide as reliable predictions as more complicated ones. They may be sufficient to assess the recovery of a species' exploitable stock even in the long term, or at least assess the (un)sustainability of particular harvesting regimes. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB Motivation:Protein family databases provide a central focus for scientific communities as well as providing useful resources to aide research. However, such resources require constant curation and often become outdated and discontinued. We have developed an ontology-driven system for capturing and managing protein family data that addresses the problems of maintenance and sustainability.
   Results:Using protein phosphatases and ABC transporters as model protein families, we constructed two protein family database resources around a central DAML+OIL ontology. Each resource contains specialist information about each protein family, providing specialized domain-specific resources based on the same template structure. The formal structure, combined with the extraction of biological data using GO terms, allows for automated update strategies. Despite the functional differences between the two protein families, the ontology model was equally applicable to both, demonstrating the generic nature of the system.

The selection and design of green and clean processes and products involve handling a huge set of data related to the environment, economics and technologies. Therefore, it is essential to employ a comprehensive technique to guide decision-making under uncertainty that can incorporate these factors.
   The paper presents decision-making under uncertainty based on life cycle analysis and considering environmental, technological, and economical drivers in the analysis. The methodology, GreenPro-1, is applicable at any stage of a process design and can be used to evaluate the environmental burdens of a product or a process throughout its life cycle, and to identify and assess opportunities to make improvements. A weighting scheme is used to integrate various criteria and policies so that a most appropriate alternative can be selected.
   The GreenPro-1 methodology is applied to a case study for offshore produced water management. In the first stage, 14 best available technologies (BAT) for treatment of produced water are evaluated individually using cradle-to-gate life cycle analysis. In the second stage, seven treatment strategies are developed from BAT and are further investigated. A treatment strategy that combines a hydrocyclone and produced water re-injection proved to be the best system among selected strategies. The combination of hydrocyclone and adsorption was found to be the next best treatment strategy. Two other noteworthy strategies were membrane and centrifuge combination, and down-hole separation and injection. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB in recent years, the threat of global climate change, high fuel import dependence, and rapidly rising electricity demand levels have intensified the quest for more sustainable energy systems. This in turn has increased the need for policy makers to promote electricity generation from renewable energy sources. Guaranteed prices coupled with a buy-back obligation for electricity fed into the grid is a popular renewables promotion instrument, especially in Europe. More recently, driven mainly by electricity market liberalisation efforts, quota targets for the share of renewables in combination with tradable 'green' certificates (TGC) have received considerable attention. TGC offer a greater theoretical potential for economic efficiency gains, due to price competition and the greater flexibility assigned to the obliged parties. While guaranteed prices and TGC schemes support the operation of renewable energy technology systems, bidding schemes for renewable energy generation capacity are used to raise economic efficiency on the plant construction side. All of these policy instruments suffer from the shortcoming that they do not explicitly account for the often widely varying environmental, social and economic impacts of the technologies concerned. In this paper, we propose a methodology for the design of renewable energy policy instruments that is based on integrated assessment. In particular, we argue that using participatory multicriteria evaluation as part of the design of renewable energy promotion policies would make it possible: (1) to differentiate the level of promotion in a systematic and transparent manner according to their socio-ecological economic impact, and (2) to explicitly account for the preferences of stakeholders. A further problem of existing TGC and bidding schemes is that diversity of supply could be severely diminished, if few low-cost technologies were allowed to dominate the renewable energy market. To ensure a certain diversity of technologies, our scheme suggests the use of different technology bands for technologies that are relatively homogeneous with respect to their maturity.

AB Wetlands in Africa are an important source of water and nutrients necessary for biological productivity and often sheer survival of people. Sustainable management of wetlands is therefore critical to the long-term health, safety and welfare of many African communities. Despite their importance, wetlands are being modified or reclaimed, often driven by economic and financial motives. Wetlands, however, contain numerous goods and services that have an economic value not only to local populations but also to people living outside the periphery of the wetland. These values can be made more explicit through economic valuation studies. The goal of this paper is to highlight the importance of wetlands for local populations in Africa and the economic consequences for these people if wetlands are degraded. After explaining the characteristics, distribution and status of wetlands in Africa, the economic values of African wetlands will be highlighted through a discussion of several economic valuation studies carried out for different African wetlands. Recommendations are made as to how economic values may be used in decision-making on wetlands to allow more sustainable management of African wetlands. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The work postulates that investments in environmental stewardship function as an informal intergenerational contract in the current social security system. An immediate pension system reform that orders a transition from a pay-as-you-go system to a 'what you save is what you get' system can erode incentives to maintain environmental conservation efforts. If environmental conservation is highly productive in the long run, pension reform could (1) damage every generation through time, (2) place perhaps a modest but unnecessary drag on economic performance or, at the other extreme, (3) destabilize the ecological system entirely by destroying a highly prized environmental resource critical to future welfare. Several reform amendments are presented, but one may be especially attractive. By formalizing an intergenerational annuity to reward a generation directly for its public conservation investments through the existing pension structure, inefficiencies can be eliminated, up front sacrifices can be reduced and reforms can employ the existing social security apparatus to collect payroll taxes and to disburse pension benefits to implement the amended intergenerational contract.

AB The debate over various definitions of sustainability has for the most part been conducted within the framework of traditional welfare economics. Discussion has centered on technical issues imbedded within the functional forms of various optimization models, especially the coefficient of the elasticity of substitution and the social discount rate. Two more basic problems are: (1) intractable theoretical difficulties within welfare economics call into question the results of traditional models of sustainability regarding intergenerational welfare and (2) equating per capita consumption with welfare contradicts empirical evidence suggesting that the link between happiness and wealth/income is relatively weak. Alternative approaches to measuring well-being are being developed and these have great potential to move the sustainability debate forward. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper focuses on a search for concrete policy measures to facilitate the overall sustainability of ecological agricultural development at a county level. For this purpose, a system dynamics model (AISEEM) has been developed to explore the potential long-term ecological, economic, institutional and social interactions of ecological agricultural development through a case study of Jinshan County in China. The model provides an experimental platform for the simulation and analysis of alternative policy scenarios. The results indicate that the diversification of land-use patterns, government low interest loans and government support for training are important policy measures for promoting the sustainable development of ecological agriculture, at least in the case study context. In addition, the study reveals that environmentally sound technology (e.g., biogas project) alone cannot sufficiently induce farmers to adopt ecological agricultural practices. Limited availability of information, risk aversion and high transaction costs are major barriers to the adoption of alternative agricultural practices. In this regard, the importance of capacity building and institutional arrangements are emphasised through the development of an improved policy-making process on agricultural sustainability. This case study highlights the importance of combining the ecological economics analytical framework with the system dynamics modelling approach as a feasible integrated tool to provide insight into the policy analysis of ecological agriculture, and thus set a solid basis for effective policy making to facilitate its sustainable development on a regional scale.

TI Reconstitution of circadian oscillation of cyanobacterial KaiC
   phosphorylation in vitro
SO SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
ID CLOCK SYSTEM; EXPRESSION; FEEDBACK; GENETICS; TIME
AB Kai proteins globally regulate circadian gene expression of cyanobacteria. The KaiC phosphorylation cycle, which persists even without transcription or translation, is assumed to be a basic timing process of the circadian clock. We have reconstituted the self-sustainable oscillation of KaiC phosphorylation in vitro by incubating KaiC with KaiA, KaiB, and adenosine triphosphate. The period of the in vitro oscillation was stable despite temperature change (temperature compensation), and the circadian periods observed in vivo in KaiC mutant strains were consistent with those measured in vitro. The enigma of the circadian clock can now be studied in vitro by examining the interactions between three Kai proteins.

TI Diversification of rice with pigeonpea in a rice-wheat cropping system

   MANAGEMENT; SORGHUM; TRENDS
AB Continuous adoption of rice-wheat cropping system (RWCS) has led to depletion of inherent soil fertility resulting in a serious threat to its sustainability in the Indo-Gangetic plain region (IGPR) of India. The inclusion of legumes in RWCS assumes a great significance to restore soil fertility. But farmers in the IGPR rarely grow legumes in the system. We, therefore, carried out farmers' participatory diagnostic survey in the Upper Gangetic plain zone (UGP) to understand farmers' fertilizer management practices for wheat (Trititicum aestivum L. Emend Fiori & Paol) following rice (Oryza sativa L.) or pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan(L)Millsp). The survey indicated that most of the farmers in UGP grew pigeonpea in place of rice under RWCS as only a break crop at a 2-3 year interval. The farmers applied, on average, 11 kg N ha(-1) and 24 kg P ha(-1) to wheat sown after rice, and 12 kg N ha(-1) and 19 kg P ha(-1) to wheat sown after pigeonpea. Wheat yields, however, were lower (3.3 t ha(-1)) when sown after pigeonpea than after rice (3.7 t ha(-1)). The survey was followed by a field experiment at Modipuram (29degrees 4' N), Meerut, India that continued during the three consecutive years (1998-1999 to 2000-2001) to examine the effect of inclusion of pigeonpea in place of rice on soil fertility, N and P use efficiency and yields of wheat. In 1998-1999, wheat yields after pigeonpea were lower than after rice, but improved significantly (p < 0.05) by 11.4-15.1% in pigeonpea plots compared with those in rice plots during 1999-2000 and 2000-2001, respectively. The use efficiency of applied N and P fertilizers in wheat, measured as agronomic efficiency and apparent recovery, was increased with combined use of fertilizer N and P at recommended rate, and also with inclusion of pigeonpea in place of rice. The post-wheat harvest NO3-N in soil profile beyond 45 cm depth was significantly greater under rice-wheat system than under pigeonpea-wheat system, suggesting that inclusion of pigeonpea may help in minimizing NO3-N leaching to deeper profile layers beyond root zone. Similarly, in the treatments receiving both 120 kg N and 26 kg P ha(-1), NO3-N beyond 45 cm soil depth was lower compared to those receiving N or P alone. Inclusion of pigeonpea in place of rice enhanced carbon accumulation in the soil profile. The available P content was, however, invariably low under pigeonpea plots as compared to that under rice. With continuous rice-wheat cropping, the bulk density (BD) of soil was increased, especially in the 30-45 cm soil profile. Inclusion of pigeonpea in the system not only helped maintaining soil BD at initial level in the surface (0-15 cm) soil layers, but also in decreasing (p < 0.05) BD in sub-surface layers (15-30 cm and 3045 cm). Compared to rice, a statistically significant (p < 0.05) positive effect of pigeonpea on root volume (58%) and root weight (99.5%) of succeeding wheat was also recorded. The net economic returns under pigeonpea-wheat system were greater compared with rice-wheat system. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The conditions for synthesizing microtubes with a surface of "house of cards" structure via needlelike particles were examined in detail. Magnesium carbonate trihydrate was formed as a metastable phase in the reaction process using magnesium hydroxide and carbon dioxide as starting materials. Subsequently, in the formation of basic magnesium carbonate from magnesium carbonate trihydrate, microtubes with a surface of house of cards structure were obtained via needlelike particles of magnesium carbonate trihydrate under certain conditions where the temperature and added amount of sodium hydroxide were properly controlled. The pore size of the microtubes could be controlled within a range of 0.5-6,mu m by adjusting the condition of needlelike particle formation. In addition, the sustainability of naphthalene release from the microtube was found to be about 6 times higher than that from naphthalene crystal.

AB Worldwide marine invaders, such as the brown alga Undaria pinnatifida, offer challenging models for unraveling the apparent paradox of sustainable settlement of exotic species over a large spectrum of environments. Two intergenic noncoding mitochondrial loci were found to be highly informative at the within-species level. Twenty-five haplotypes were found over the whole dataset (333 base pairs, 524 individuals, and 24 populations). The native range showed striking population genetic structure stemming from low diversity within and high differentiation among populations, a pattern not observed in the introduced range of this seaweed. Contrary to classical expectations of founding effects associated with accidental introduction of exotic species, most of the introduced populations showed high genetic diversity. At the regional scale, genetic diversity and sequence divergence showed contrasting patterns in the two main areas of introduction (Europe and Australasia), suggesting different processes of introduction in the two regions. Gene genealogy analyses point to aquaculture as a major vector of introduction and spread in Europe but implicate maritime traffic in promoting recurrent migration events from the native range to Australasia. The multiplicity of processes and genetic signatures associated with the successful invasion confirms that multiple facets of global change, e.g., aquaculture practices, alteration of habitats, and increased traffic, act in synergy at the worldwide level, facilitating successful pandemic introductions.

AB Apoptosis or programmed cell death (PCD) is a genetically regulated cellular, physiological and biochemical Suicidal mechanism that plays a crucial role in the development and defense of homeostasis, in which the cell participates in its own demise via a cascade of molecular interactions. PCD can be modulated by various stimuli including infectious agents or drugs. Arsenic is one among inducible toxic agent that triggers apoptosis via free radical generation. Since the generation of free radicals during the metabolism of arsenic is thought to be involved in arsenic toxicosis, understanding the deleterious effects caused by the ROS that attack the vital molecules like DNA has become important. The present work was conducted to evaluate the regulatory effect exerted by Vitamin C and Vitamin E upon the apoptotic process, which can be assessed by the presence of cells with apoptosis associated DNA breaks and characterize the role of TNF-alpha and caspase-3 in rats intoxicated with arsenic. Male albino rats of wistar strain (120-150 g) were used in this study and are further divided into seven groups. We observed that ascorbate and a-tocopherol selectively altered the extent of DNA damage by reducing TNF-alpha level and inhibiting the activation of caspase cascade, from these observations it is strongly believed that the present vitamins supplementation perspective, though observed in animal model, will have sustainable curative value among the already afflicted populations, neutralizing impact on freshly emerging arsenicosis scenario and possible proactive protection to those potentially susceptible to arsenicals exposure.

AB Despite the fact that landscape level processes dominate wetland ecosystem development and sustainability, restoration decisions (including those for compensatory mitigation) are typically made on a project-by-project basis. Watershed planning designed to strategically restore wetlands has the potential to provide dramatic benefits by restoring ecosystem-level processes (functions) that maintain water resource integrity. We developed a GIS-based model to predict the suitability for wetland restoration for all locations in the Cuyahoga River watershed (2107 km(2)), in northeastern Ohio (U.S.A.). The model offers a useful tool to focus and set goals for wetland restoration efforts in a spatially explicit way. A two-phase approach was used: the first is to develop criteria, or environmental indicators, to identify the total population of sites suitable for wetland restoration. Locations are identified where restoration has a high likelihood of success and will be sustainable over the long term. Criteria used include hydric soils, land use, topography, stream order, and a saturation index based on slope and flow accumulation in each grid cell in the model. The second phase "filters" the total population of available sites in order to prioritize them according to their potential to contribute to water resource integrity once restored. We generated three versions of the suitability model depicting restoration potential. All versions rely on the same criteria but vary in how the factors were weighted or the hydrology criterion was calculated. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The Pantanal, a large and still rather pristine wetland in the center of the South American continent, is becoming increasingly threatened by large development programs. Agroindustries and reservoirs for hydroelectric power generation in the catchment area modify discharge pattern and sediment load of the tributaries, plans for canalization of the Paraguay River (hidrovia) are putting in risk the natural flood regime of large areas inside the Pantanal, and attract industries with high potential for environmental pollution, economic pressure on the traditional cattle ranchers accelerates the transformation of natural vegetation into pasture, etc. These activities negatively affect habitat and species diversity and scenic beauty but also the hydrological buffer capacity of the Pantanal. The article summarizes the ecological conditions of the Pantanal, discusses commercial and non-commercial values of the area, describes constraints for the development of intensive agriculture and cattle ranching, and discusses development afternatives. Considering the low density of human population inside the Pantanal, it can be concluded that development pressure on the Pantanal arises mostly from pressure groups outside the area that will also mostly benefit from the economic return of the development projects. Low density of human population would still allow the application of economically viable and environmentally friendly development alternatives that maintain and sustainably manage one of the largest wetlands in the world.

AB Small mammals such as mice and voles have potential as indicators of sustainable forest management. They have an important functional role in forests, they are economically important as prey for furbearer populations, and they respond to disturbance in a characteristic manner. In Ontario, Canada, several small mammal species have been suggested as bioindicators. However, strong year-to-year variation in population levels independent of forest disturbance means that very long time frames would be required to detect trends. Models of habitat supply have been suggested as a method of monitoring small mammals. We explore the feasibility of monitoring structural measurements and habitat supply for small mammal species using an area near White River, Ontario, Canada, as a case study. Small mammals were surveyed in the region for 3 years, and associations with mapped and stand level habitat attributes examined. Thirteen species were recorded, but only five species were recorded in sufficient numbers for habitat associations to be examined. The deer mouse and red-backed vole were recorded from all mature forest habitats, although both were more prevalent in mixedwood stands. Red-backed vole abundance was linearly related to stand age and the volume of downed logs. Deer mice were most abundant in recently clearcut stands, with abundance declining sharply in 5-15-year-old stands. They were also abundant in mature forest, where they were significantly associated with downed wood volume. Vegetation complexity was also significant for both species. Habitat supply maps for both species could be readily developed, and structural attributes modified by forest practices were important. However, strong year-to-year variation in the abundance of both species in mature forest prevented carrying capacities from being reliably assigned to habitat supply maps. Thus, while relative changes in the availability of high, medium and low quality habitat are identifiable, expected changes in minimum population size cannot be inferred. The effect of cumulative disturbances on the quality of available habitat is also unknown. Without this information, change in habitat supply cannot be used to assess the sustainability of forest management actions. We suggest that dynamic landscape meta-population (DLMP) models may provide one solution, and require further exploration as a sustainability assessment tool. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB The sugar maple decline observed in forests of northeastern North America is one of the disturbances that may have caused changes in the structure and composition of maple-dominated stands. Such changes may alter the sustainability of these uneven-aged ecosystems. The hypothesis that the decline observed in sugar maple populations over recent decades has modified stand structure and composition was tested using data from the Forest Ecosystem Research and Monitoring Network (RESEF) in Quebec, Canada. Analysis of the diameter class density distribution, growth rates, and mortality schedule for 12 stands indicated a decline in health and productivity in the sugar maple population. This result suggests that environmental factors have limited the development of this species in all strata. The American beech population responded by doubling its pole cohort density in 10 years. Although increases in American beech stem density tended to counter sugar maple mortality, results suggest that stand structure has been shifted from a sustainable structure to an unsustainable one over a 10-year period. The high mortality of sugar maple and the large increase of pole-size beech trees deeply altered forest structure and composition in the majority of stands studied. These changes question seriously the sustainability of sugar maple in these forest ecosystems. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A new type of monolithic high-power fiber laser with a multifiber series and distributed pumping is put forward. The distributed pumping multifiber series fiber laser is a good solution to scale up laser output when injection power is limited by the output powers of a pigtailed laser diode or the maximum sustainable powers of pumping couplers. The simulation results show that the laser has advantages of high transfer efficiency and good temperature uniformity in the kilowatt power domain. (C) 2005 Optical Society of America.

TI Trade disputes in the commercial aircraft industry: A background note
SO AERONAUTICAL JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB The long-running debate between the US and the EU over government supports for large commercial aircraft has recently boiled over into a major dispute involving the World Trade Organisation (WTO). While the two sides have currently backed off from what could be a very damaging WTO outcome, there are still wide differences over the legitimacy of government supports (direct or indirect) for Airbus and Boeing airliners. This paper:
   Describes the background to the current dispute.
   Analyses the 1992 US-EU Agreement on Large Aircraft Subsidies.
   Outlines the WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures and the decision by the US to mount an action under the WTO complaints procedures against launch investment for Airbus and the EU's counter claim against Boeing.
   Considers the precedents set by the WTO rulings on the Brazilian-Canadian dispute over regional jet supports.
   Summarises the US-EU complaints to the WTO.
   Considers potential outcomes and the implications for the civil aerospace industry on both sides of the Atlantic.
   Analyses the wider issues surrounding government intervention in the aerospace sector.
   The paper views the dispute as a reflection of fundamental differences, based primarily on divergent economic doctrines and values, between the US and the EU states. There could be especially damaging consequences for the EU should the WTO rule against the systems of repayable launch investment used by the Airbus governments. But both sides could lose heavily from the affair and there is a good case for maintaining some form of direct government intervention in civil aerospace technology acquisition, even near market research, in support of environmental sustainability objectives.

AB The dwindling nature of overseas development assistance in the early part of the 1990s called for the establishment of capital markets in some African countries, including Ghana, with the view to increasing foreign direct investments and achieving sustainable inflows, growth and development. One important factor which affects the determination of prices and the growth of capital markets is macroeconomic risk which is quite high in developing countries. Following works done on advanced stock markets, this study seeks to investigate the impact of six macroeconomic risk factors on asset pricing in the various industrial classification-financial, manufacturing, food and beverages, distribution and mining under the Ghana Stock Exchange (GSE) for the period January 1997 to December 2002. Using the arbitrage pricing methodology developed by Ross (1976) and Chen et al. (1986), the study revealed that investors in Ghana considered three main macroeconomic risk factors-short-term interest rate risk, inflation risk and the term structure of the country's interest rate in the determination of the various industrial asset prices during the period under consideration. Analysis of the risks and returns profile of the industries also shows that financial assets made the best gains on the market. Both general and specific policy recommendations aimed at improving the performance of the GSE are explored.

AB Rainfed cotton farming is a risky enterprise. It has always been a challenge to sustain cotton productivity under rainfed conditions not only in India but also in similar agroenvironments elsewhere. The present study is an attempt to find out the most sustainable soil under varying rainfall through crop yield correlation with agro-environment factors, like soil physiographic conditions, growing period rainfall, crop ET and phasic rainfall, by conducting (farmers') field experiment in a representative catena with four different soil types in central India. Cotton (hybrid-H4) was grown for 5 years; 3 years under normal rainfall, I year under excessive rainfall and I year under drought conditions. The investigation revealed that in the excess rainfall to drought years, yield fluctuation varied from 2% to 38% over the normal year in shallow soils occurring on a pediment plain to the very deep soils in a valley plain. However, the yield fluctuation in deep Vertisols occurring on lower Piedmont and narrow valley, representing Vertic Haplustepts (P3) and Typic Haplusterts (P4), was 25-38% and 6-25%, respectively. The low yield fluctuation and high yield correlation with agro-environmental factors, observed for P3 soils, suggests the suitability of Vertic Haplustepts (P3) for cotton production under varying rainfall conditions. Cultivating P3 soils for cotton could stabilize the income of cotton farmers and research relating to cotton genotype improvement under rainfed conditions should be carried out to minimize soil effects.. The. international land evaluation criteria suggested by FAO show that Vertisols (P3 and P4) qualify as a suitable category for,cotton production under rainfed conditions. However, the present study indicates that this categorization may need revision in view of the adverse climatic conditions of central India. In order to improve the effectiveness of the FAO's land evaluation criteria for sub-tropical Vertisols, the study suggests that more emphasis be given to rainfall in the critical growth phases related to crop yield and to soil hydraulic conductivity related to the Ca2+/Mg2+ ratio in computing land indices, rather than total quantum rainfall during the growing period. Also, too many soil properties are presently considered in the FAO method. A quantum of 250-325 mm rainfall at the square initiation to peak flowering stages was found to influence yield. Under climatic aberration, the high fluctuation of cotton productivity in deep Vertisol (P4) may be minimized by adoption of any soil management technology (e.g. ridges or broad-bed furrow system) that helps in improving internal drainage.. It is, therefore, urgent that the Indian Government should enact special legislation or introduce incentives for the Vertisol farmers who mostly use old cultivation practices to adopt such technology on a large scale. A quadratic regression model developed in this study to compute the yield under varying rainfall may help in estimating the economic losses to the farmers and quantifying crop insurance compensation.

ID IMMOBILIZATION
AB Accumulation of municipal solid wastes, such as household solid waste, can be rated as a harmful, if not critical, pollution problem. However, if these wastes can be composted and the end product used as soil organic amendment or fertilizer, this may represent one of the alternatives for achieving the goal of ensuring integrated and sustainable waste management. The objective of the present work is to evaluate the nitrogen fertilizing value of household solid waste compost in two soils of Morocco with contrasting properties: a sandy soil and a loamy-clay soil. The compost used in this study was prepared by aerobic biodegradation using the organic fraction after its separation from the noncompostable materials. A study of nitrogen availability of the compost was carried out in a Soil - Compost - Crop system under greenhouse conditions using lettuce as a test crop. Four increasing compost rates of 0, 10, 20 and 30 tons/ha were applied to the soils. The recommended mineral fertilizer rate by the Agricultural Extension Service for lettuce and its half values constituted additional treatments. The results show a high stock of mineral nitrogen in the loamy-clay soil before crop installation. Unlike the loamy-clay soil, the sandy soil generated a better yield increase and a better response to mineral fertilizers. The effect of compost rate on nitrogen mineralization was significant in the two studied soils. The quantities of mineralized nitrogen of the compost varied between 15 and 24% of the compost total nitrogen applied to the sandy and the loamy-clay soils during the lettuce growing season. Therefore the use of household solid waste compost as soil amendment constitutes a beneficial alternative in Mediterranean soils because it permits the generation of a high nitrogen fertilizing value.

AB Background: Little is known about physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior patterning or its impact on long-term PA sustainability, particularly during the critical transition from adolescence to adulthood.
   Methods: Nationally representative self-reported data were collected (National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health: Wave 1, 1994-1995; Wave 11, 1996; Wave 111, 2001-2002). Cluster analyses identified homogeneous groups of adolescents with similar PA and sedentary behaviors. Logistic regression predicted odds of meeting national activity recommendations in adolescence and young adulthood.
   Results: Seven clusters were characterized as follows: C 1, high television (TV) /video, video gaming; C2, high skating, video gaming; C3, high sports participation with parents, high overall sports participation; C4, use of neighborhood recreation centers, high sports participation; C5, TV viewing limited by parents, moderate participation in school physical education (PE); C6, low parental TV control, reporting few activities overall; C7, active in school (team/individual sports, academic clubs, and PE). Odds of adolescents meeting PA recommendations were highest in C2 (odds ratio= 13.1), C3 (5.8), C4 (4.2), and C7 (4.3) compared to C1. Independent of adolescent PA, absolute odds of meeting recommendations as young adults declined but were still relatively high in these clusters, indicating greater long-term PA sustainability. By young adulthood, however, overall PA declined dramatically in skaters/gamers (C2) and was notably low among those with TV viewing limited by parents (C5).
   Conclusions: While odds of meeting PA guidelines in adulthood declined in all clusters, the magnitude of this decline varied by cluster (declining most dramatically in skaters/ gamers), providing insights into where to target effective intervention strategies that promote sustainable PA behaviors.

AB Developmental, learning, and behavioral disabilities are a significant public health problem. Environmental chemicals can interfere with brain development during critical periods, thereby impacting sensory, motor, and cognitive function. Because regulation in the United States is based on limited testing protocols and essentially requires proof of harm rather than proof of lack of harm, some undefined fraction of these disabilities may reflect adverse impacts of this "vast toxicological experiment" (H. L. Needleman, as quoted in B. Weiss D P. J. Landrigan, 2000, p. 373). Yet the hazards of environmental pollutants are inherently preventable. Psychologists can help prevent developmental disabilities by mobilizing and affecting public policy, educating and informing consumers, contributing to interdisciplinary research efforts, and taking action within their own homes and communities to reduce the toxic threat to children.

AB In interphase eukaryotic cells, molecular transport between the cytoplasm and the nucleus is mediated by the nuclear pore complex (NPC), which perforates the double-membraned nuclear envelope (NE). Local permeability of the NE at large intact nuclei (similar to 400 mu m in diameter) isolated from Xenopus laevis oocytes was studied by scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM). Steady-state tip current versus tip-nucleus distance curves (approach curves) were measured with 10- and 2-mu m-diameter Pt disk microelectrodes at the nuclei in isotonic buffer solutions containing redox-active molecules. The approach curves in the normalized form are independent of the tip diameter, indicating diffusion-limited membrane transport of the redox molecules. SECM chronoamperometry demonstrated that a decrease in the steady-state tip current at short tip-nucleus distances is due to smaller diffusion coefficients and concentrations of the redox molecules in the nucleus than those in the buffer solution. The experimental approach curves fit very well with theoretical ones for freely permeable membranes, yielding the NE permeability to the molecules that is at least 2 orders of magnitude larger than permeability of bilayer lipid membranes and cell membranes. This result indicates that passive transport of the redox molecules across the NE is facilitated by open NPC pores. The flux of the redox molecules sustainable by a single NPC channel (> 9.8 x 106 molecules per NPC per second) and the diameter of the channel pore (> 15 nm) were estimated from the SECM data by assuming the NE as an array of nanometer-sized NPC pores. The effects of the redox molecules on the nucleus and the NPC function were examined by studying signal-mediated nuclear import of rhodamine-labeled bovine serum albumin with and without nuclear localization signals by fluorescence microscopy.

AB The emergence of local collaborative projects presents a rich vein for advancing the empirical and theoretical understanding of governance in tourism. In particular, new problems and challenges to tourism policymaking are raised, such as achieving effective organization, representation, and evaluation of outcomes. This paper evaluates a collaboration adopted by a British district council in the formulation of a local strategy for promoting the adoption of sustainable practices by tourism businesses. The key findings of the study emphasize the role of the public sector in promoting "bottom-up" forms of governance, the temporal dynamics of the process, and the reality of innovation in policymaking. 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This study examines the importance of host-guest relationships in community-based, working holidays. It looks at a working vacation in the Carib Territory of Dominica to assess how sociocultural systems for the treatment of tourists feature in small-scale tourism. The study finds that such working holidays appear to imitate elements of traditional forms of hospitality. Some of the duties and obligations of host-guest relationships appear to be carried into the sphere of guest-local interactions, in particular, non-monetary reciprocities. This suggests that understanding the nature of hospitality is central to analyzing small-scale, community-based tourism, and it has implications for understanding behaviors, outcomes, and impacts.

AB Analysis of core criteria of ecotourism suggests two "ideal types" based on the level of sustainability outcomes. The minimalist emphasizes superficial learning opportunities focused on charismatic megafauna, while its sustainability objectives are site-specific and status quo-oriented. The comprehensive model adopts a holistic and global approach to attractions and interpretation that fosters environmental enhancement, deep understanding, and transformation of behavior. It is argued that the comprehensive model can best promote global sustainability by accommodating selected hard (or small-scale) and soft (or large-scale) characteristics, thereby taking advantage of the economies of scale offered by the latter.

AB Disease epizootics have negatively affected production and expansion of the shrimp culture industry. This, along with environmental concerns regarding limited water resources and contamination of receiving streams, has caused the industry to investigate more sustainable and biosecure management practices. A study was conducted to evaluate the effect of limited water exchange on water quality, growth and survival of the Pacific white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei postlarvae (PL) in greenhouse-enclosed raceways. Concentrations of NH(4)-N did not exceed 2.0 mg l(-1) during this period; whereas, NO(2)-N exceeded 26.4 mg l(-1), indicating assimilation of primary amines by primary productivity. Periodic removal of suspended solids by a common pressurized sand filter and injection of oxygen into culture water resulted in high-survival rates for both raceways (97.5 and 106.0%) with an average biomass yield of 4.29 +/- 0.06 kg m(-3). Shrimp samples collected during the nursery trial and at harvest showed no signs of bacterial or viral pathogen infections. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Population structure, catch composition and CPUE of the artisanally

AB To evaluate the population structure of Ucides cordatus in the Caete estuary, crabs were sampled bimonthly over 13 months in three Rhizophora mangle forest stands that differed in their accessibility and fishing history. Additionally, sex- and size composition of the commercial catch and catch per unit of effort (CPUE - the number of crabs captured per fisherman per day) were monitored between 1997 and 2003. Average and maximum crab sizes (carapace width, CW) from all three sampling sites combined were 6.1 cm and 8.8 cm in males, respectively, and 5.5 and 7.3 cm in females. Crabs were largest at the site that had been reportedly less exploited in the past. The overall sex ratio was skewed towards males (53-62%). Egg carrying females were only encountered during the rainy season. Mean crab abundance and biomass was 1.7 specimens m(-2) and 142 g m-2 fresh mass. Only large males were commercially harvested (98% >= 6.5 cm CW). Their biomass was 53 g m(-2) and the Caete estuary yields an annual production of 1200 t of these large specimens. This is approximately the quantity that is currently being harvested. CPUE was similar in 1997 and 1998, then decreased by 15% until 2000 and stabilized for the rest of the study period. Mean capture size (cm CW) ranged between 7.2 +/- 0.5 and 7.5 +/- 0.2 and was above the size of 50% (and even 100%) male maturity and the legal minimum capture size. There is no evidence that the Caete crab population is overfished, despite over 30 years of de facto open access exploitation. Apparently, the selectivity of fishermen and consumers for large male crabs as well as the local artisanal capture techniques are key factors in preventing an overfishing of the Caete crab population until today. Our results suggest that the economic and social sustainability of this fishery will be affected well before the biological one, which should be considered in the recently proposed coastal co-management plan for the region.

AB A study was performed from May 2001 to October 2002 to assess density and morphological characteristics of maguey, A gave salmiana ssp. crassispina, in five districts of the state of Zacatecas, Mexico. A random stratified sampling procedure was used, where each area with different maguey densities (high, moderate, low, and very low) was treated as an independent stratum. Then, 154 randomly distributed sites covering an area of 250 m it-ere evaluated obtaining the following data: number of individuals by age class (juvenile, prereproductive, reproductive, and mature), height, crown width, and basal diameter. Thematic maps as well as aerial photos and field visits were utilized to produce a base map, which was digitized, vectorized, and georeferenced using GIS tools. The total area occupied by maguey populations was 59,905 ha. Mean densities were as follows: 1, 142 ha with 3,064 magueys per ha; 17,441 ha with 892 magueys per ha; 34,088 ha with 725 magueys per ha; and 7,234 ha with 653 magueys per ha. There were differences in age class, height, crown width, and basal diameter between strata as well among strata. The data suggested that different management programs must be used to ensure sustainability of this resource.

AB The present paper endeavours to discuss some of the potential issues inherent in the developmental work for indigenous psychologies, especially in the Western context. The discussion is made around two topical issues, sustainability and local knowledge. The developmental processes in indigenous psychologies are influenced by the inter- and intracommunity environment. It is important to trace the development of local knowledge in a sustained community environment. The cross-fertilization of ecological perspectives with indigenous psychological knowledge can enlighten our understandings of global issues in psychology as well as the applications of psychological knowledge to a local context. A theoretical model is proposed to highlight major social psychological processes in a participatory community environment - the model is expected to address essential contentious issues to the future of a globalized psychology, especially the way integrated local knowledge can lay the foundations of a globalized indigenous psychology.

TI R&D Programme on Generation IV Nuclear Energy Systems: the high
   temperature gas-colled reactors
SO ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER
LA English
DT Article
AB The Generation IV Technology Roadmap selected, among others, a sequenced development of advanced high temperature gas cooled reactors as one of the main focus for R&D on future nuclear energy systems. The selection of this research objectives originates both from the significance of high temperature and fast neutrons for nuclear energy to meet the needs for a sustainable development for the medium-long term (2020/2030 and beyond), and from the significant common R&D pathway that supports both medium term industrial projects and more advanced versions of gas cooled reactors. The first step of the "Gas Technology Path" aims to support the development of a modular HTR to meet specific international market needs around 2020. The second step is a Very High Temperature Reactor - VHTR (> 950 degrees C) - to efficiently produce hydrogen through thermo-chemical or electro-chemical water splitting or to generate electricity with an efficiency above 50%, among other applications of high temperature nuclear heat. The third step of the Path is a Gas Fast Reactor GFR - that features a fast-spectrum helium-cooled reactor and closed fuel cycle, with a direct or indirect thermodynamic cycle for electricity production and full recycle of actinides. Hydrogen production is also considered for the GFR. The paper succinctly presents the R&D program currently under definition and partially launched within the Generation IV International Forum on this consistent set of advanced gas cooled nuclear systems.

TI Adapting the 'family wellbeing' empowerment program to the needs of
   remote indigenous school children
SO AUSTRALIAN AND NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
AB Objective: To adapt the Family Wellbeing empowerment program, which was initially designed to support adults to take greater control and responsibility for their decisions and lives, to the needs of Indigenous school children living in remote communities.
   Method. At the request of two schools in remote Indigenous communities in far north Queensland, a pilot personal development and empowerment program based on the adult Family Wellbeing principles was developed, conducted and evaluated in the schools. The main aims of the program were to build personal identity and to encourage students to recognise their future potential and be more aware of their place in the community and wider society.
   Results: Participation in the program resulted in significant social and emotional growth for the students. Outcomes described by participating students and teachers included increased analytical and reflective skills, greater ability to think for oneself and set goals, less teasing and bullying in the school environment, and an enhanced sense of identity, friendship and,social relatedness'.
   Conclusion: This pilot implementation of the Family Wellbeing Program adapted for schools demonstrated the program's potential to enhance Indigenous young people's personal growth and development. Challenges remain in increasing parental/ family involvement and ensuring the program's sustainability and transferability. The team has been working with relevant stakeholders to further develop and package the School-based Family Wellbeing program for Education Queensland's New Basics curriculum framework.

TI Health working with industry to promote fruit and vegetables: a case
   study of the Western Australian Fruit and Vegetable Campaign with
   reflection on effectiveness of inter-sectoral action
SO AUSTRALIAN AND NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
AB Objective: In 1990, the Department of Health in Western Australia (DOH) initiated a five-year campaign to increase awareness of the need to eat more fruit and vegetables and to encourage increased consumption. This paper describes aspects of the campaign and reviews the strengths and weaknesses of health and fruit and vegetable industry alliances to extend and sustain the campaign.
   Method. The fruit and vegetable industry was engaged through information sharing, consultation, working groups and joint promotions. The partnership was examined in terms of six inter-sectoral action dimensions (necessity; opportunity and capacity to work together; established relationships for goal achievement; degree of planning; potential for evaluation; and sustainability of action).
   Results and conclusions: There were both need and opportunity for each sector to work together. Health had commitment, expertise and resources to plan, implement and evaluate the campaign. Industry had established channels of communication within the supply chain. Sustained health sector presence provided incentive, endorsement and policy direction. Resources and infrastructure limited partnership sustainability. Greatest potential for success occurred when participants' contributions were closely aligned to their core business and there was a body responsible for co-ordinating action.

TI Statement on the proposal for the EAFRD Regulation, COM(2004)490 of the
   Scientific Advisory Board on Agricultural Policy, Sustainable Farm
   Management and Rural Development at the Federal Ministry of Consumer
SO BERICHTE UBER LANDWIRTSCHAFT
LA German
DT Article
AB The Regulation aims at enhancing the competitive capacity of farming and forestry, supporting the environment and the fanning sector as well as at improving the quality of life in rural areas and their economic diversification. A package of measures, that largely matches the one currently in effect, is used to achieve this target. Yet, the instruments under the EAFRD Regulation are more target-oriented and easier to apply in administrative terms. In the short to medium-term, the financial support of the competitive capacity can be justified by the great pressure for adjustment on the European farming sector, at present, and the provision of public services. In the long-term, the EU must concentrate on the creation and monitoring of fair competition rules and should only grant financial support for the provision of public goods. The compensatory allowance should only be granted in mountain areas so as to preserve open spaces there and a readiness to produce. The compensatory allowance is no longer justified in the other less-favoured areas to cushion nature-induced cost disadvantages in production. Due to their additionality, the measures under this Regulation must be coordinated with those under the first pillar of the common agricultural policy and other regional programmes at a small-scale level. The restriction of farm support to micro-farms in the case of individual measures can exert undesirable structural effects in Germany especially because the regime currently in force also includes medium-sized farms that would then drop out. It would make more sense to curb financial support per farm. The Advisory Board welcomes the unification of the financing and programming frameworks that this Regulation will achieve. The evaluation processes should be deepened by means of ambitious analyses so as to disclose long-term effects, in particular. The Advisory Board suggests a curtailment of the first pillar, as a matter of priority, if a reduction of the financing limit for the common agricultural policy should be required.

TI Livestock production in Germany - perspectives seen from the production

SO BERICHTE UBER LANDWIRTSCHAFT
LA German
DT Article
ID MILK-PRODUCTION; FERTILITY; PERFORMANCE; YIELD; CARCASS; HEALTH; DIETS;
   PIGS
AB Compared to international standards, the competitiveness of livestock production in Germany is limited due to a high number of small farms and a high diversity as well as a high variation in the conditions of production. This diversity and variation raise the question to whether a one-sided strategy that focuses primarily on the minimisation of production costs is accurate to generate the potential of the additional value in the context of production and marketing of animal products.
   This paper deals with the advantages and disadvantages of different local factors in relation to the competitiveness of livestock production. Furthermore, the three most relevant strategies for added value are discussed with regard to their potentials and limitations. These are minimising production costs by intensification, production of high product and process qualities and organic livestock production. Special attention is paid to the limitations of animal production on the farm level.
   Due to the diversity and the variation in individual conditions of competition and production, it can be concluded that the one-sided strategy of minimising production costs is not suited on its own to reach the goal. This strategy exceeds the marginal productivity when economical advantages are exhausted by undesirable side-effects such as an increase in animal health disorders, environmental damage or a reduction in the taste of animal products. Exceeding the undesirable side-effects can provoke a reduction in the consumer's purchase and can threaten to jeopardize the purchasing power of the local market.
   An increase in diversification of products is recommended by the means of defined product and process qualities. This enlarges the diversity of animal products for heterogeneous consumer groups and provides better options for the single farm to make it possible to adapt to the demands of a graded production of quality.
   In this context, the assessment and remuneration of additional values in relation to product and process qualities by means of the production method or by procedural measures are not validated and justified. In contrast, a result-oriented and evidence-based proof on the farm level is necessary to regain confidence and credibility of the consumers and to minimise distortion of competition. The sooner livestock production in Germany faces the diversity and the multiple challenges on level of farm and down-stream sectors, the better it will be able to set the course to provide an economical and sustainable base for as high as possible a number of remaining farms. With regard to the outlined problems, an ongoing process without modification can be expected to provide perspective only for a comparable low number of livestock farms.

AB The Eurasian woodcock (Scolopax rusticola) is a game species experiencing high hunting pressure, long-term modifications of its habitats, and with questions regarding its current conservation status. Winter is a season of highest concentration of birds and hunting pressure but woodcock precise habitat requirements are poorly known. It is crucial to assess threats and to develop sustainable management options for the conservation of woodcock populations. During three consecutive winters. we monitored 65 individual woodcocks fitted with radio-tags in Brittany, France. Habitat selection was analysed using GIS and compositional analysis, in relation to vegetation types, soil variables (humus types) and the abundance of their main prey (earthworms). Woodcocks used different habitats diurnally and nocturnally, generally preferring areas with high earthworm biomass. Diurnal habitat selection in forests was associated with humus type (preference for mulls, rich in earthworms) and dense shrub strata (better protection). Hedges with a high density of trees and shrub were also important habitat. At night, grazed meadows were the prefer-red habitat, containing five times higher biomass of earthworms compared to cultivated fields. Sustainable management of populations requires protection and management of habitats that incorporates food and cover. Forestry practices should preserve rich humus types and coppices by choosing tree species that ameliorate the soil and soil tilling. Changes in landscapes and intensive agricultural practices are current threats to woodcock populations: destruction of hedges, decrease of permanent grazed meadows, impoverishment of soils fauna biomasses from ploughing and chemical applications. However, woodcocks may benefit from the recent development of set-asides, grass field-borders and simplified farm practices (no-tillage and direct sowing). (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Invasive species pose a major, yet poorly addressed, threat to sustainable forestry. Here we set forth an interdisciplinary science strategy, of research, development, and applications to reduce this threat. To spur action by public and private entities that too often are slow, reluctant, or unable to act, we recommend (a) better integrating invasive species into sustainable forestry frameworks such as the Montreal Process and forest certification programs; (b) developing improved cost estimates to inform choices about international trade and pest suppression efforts; and (c) building distributed information systems that deliver information on risks, identification, and response strategies. To enhance the success of prevention and management actions, we recommend (a) advancing technologies for molecular identification, expert systems, and remote sensing, (b) evolving approaches for ecosystem and landscape management; and (c) better anticipating interactions between species invasions and other global change processes.

AB The composition, abundance, and distribution of seagrasses on Tongsha Island were studied from 21 to 29 April 2004. A total of seven seagrass species from six genera and two families were identified. Among them, four species were new to Taiwan, including Cymodocea rotundata Ehrenb. et Hempr. ex Aschers., Cymodocea serrulata (R. Br.) Aschers. and Magnus, Syringodium isoetifolium (Aschers.) Dandy, and Thalassodendron ciliatum (Forsk.) den Hartog. The species number of seagrasses was 14% of the total global number. The total coverage area of the seagrass beds was estimated to be 8.2 km(2) distributed around Tongsha Island and the lagoon. Mean percentage cover and shoot density were high, ranging from 20 to 95% and &LT; 1250 to &GT; 2500 shoots m(-2), respectively. The large area of the seagrass bed, the high shoot density and coverage of seagrasses, and the diverse species of Tongsha Island indicate that the seagrass resource on Tungsha Island is very abundant. These seagrass beds must be conserved to ensure the sustainable management of Tongsha Island.

ID DEATH; TRANSPLANTATION; DONORS
AB This case report outlines the clinical process whereby a patient with severe traumatic brain injury became a non-heartbeating organ donor after a withdrawal-of-care decision. This process raises a series of ethical questions regarding decision-making on grounds of futility, the role of the next of kin, informed consent, the accommodation of manoeuvres directed towards organ retrieval at maximal viability, and the timing and determination of death. Although many aspects of the process can be accommodated within fundamental ethical principles and a broad interpretation of the concept of the 'best interests', the variance with established law requires authoritative clarification if a need for transplantable organs is to be responded to without compromising the reputation of practitioners involved in this area of care. Therefore, this recruitment strategy warrants wide public and professional debate to achieve longer-term sustainability and ensure the protection of all parties.

AB The drive towards a more sustainable and integrated approach to Pest management has engendered a renewed interest in conservation biological control, the role of natural enemy communities and their interactions with prey. Monoclonal antibodies have provided significant advances in enhancing our knowledge of trophic interactions and can be employed to help quantify predation on target species. The tetragnathid spider Pachygnatha degeeri Sundevall was collected from fields of winter wheat in the UK and assayed by ELISA for aphid proteins. It was demonstrated that this spider did not simply consume greater quantities of aphids because it was bigger. In addition, P. degeeri contained significantly greater concentrations of aphid in their guts than other spiders, showing that aphids comprised a greater proportion of their diet. Although P. degeeri constituted only 6% of the spider population numerically, females and males respectively contained 16% and 37% of total aphid proteins within all spiders screened, significantly more than their density would predict. These spiders also preyed upon aphids at a disproportionately high rate in June, during the aphid establishment phase, theoretically the best time for limiting growth in the aphid population. Although less abundant than other generalist predators, the capability of these hunting spiders to consume large numbers of aphids highlights them as a more significant component of the predator complex than had previously been realized. Limitation of aphid numbers early in the year by generalist predators provides more time for the specialist aphid predators and parasitoids to move in.

AB The Garry Oak Ecosystem (GOE) is a fragmented and endangered ecosystem in Canada, and is currently the focus of conservation and restoration efforts in British Columbia. However, little is known about the basic biology of GOE forbs, or their relationships with pollinating insects. We monitored wildflowers and their insect visitors in 25 quadrats within a 25 x 25 metre plot, located in a fragment of the GOE near Duncan, British Columbia, for six weeks (the majority of the flowering period). Overall, 21 native and non-native forb species flowered in our quadrats during the survey, and we observed an additional six forb species flowering outside of our quadrats. Eight forbs were visited within quadrats by a total of 13 insect taxa, identified to morphospecies. Visits by eight additional morphospecies were observed outside of the quadrats. In general, visitation was low; however, most insect morphospecies were observed visiting more than one plant species, and most plant species were visited by more than one insect morphospecies, suggesting that pollination may be generalised in this community. A chi(2) analysis indicated that insect visitation was not proportional to the relative abundance of forbs, with higher than expected visitation to Common camas (Camassia quamash), and no observed visits to 11 species, most with very small (putatively unattractive) flowers. The most frequent insect visitor was the introduced Honeybee, Apis mellifera, followed by native mason bees (Osmia spp.) and mining bees (Andrena spp.). Our observations provide baseline data for future, detailed studies that should investigate the importance of plant-pollinator mutualisms for sustainability of populations and communities in this rare ecosystem.

AB Life history theories attempt to explain the evolution of organism traits as adaptations to environmental variation. A model involving three primary life history strategies (endpoints on a triangular surface) describes general patterns of variation more comprehensively than schemes that examine single traits or merely contrast fast versus slow life histories. It provides a general means to predict a priori the types of populations with high or low demographic resilience, production potential, and conformity to density-dependent regulation. Periodic (long-lived, high fecundity, high recruitment variation) and opportunistic (small, short-lived, high reproductive effort, high demographic resilience) strategies should conform poorly to models that assume density-dependent recruitment. Periodic-type species reveal greatest recruitment variation and compensatory reserve, but with poor conformity to stock-recruitment models. Equilibrium-type populations (low fecundity, large egg size, parental care) should conform better to assumptions of density-dependent recruitment, but have lower demographic resilience. The model's predictions are explored relative to sustainable harvest, endangered species conservation, supplemental stocking, and transferability of ecological indices. When detailed information is lacking, species ordination according to the triangular model provides qualitative guidance for management and development of more detailed predictive models.

AB Relationships between fish population responses to changes in their vital rates and commonly available life history traits would be a powerful screening tool to guide management about species vulnerability, to focus future data collection on species and life stages of concern, and to aid in designing effective habitat enhancements. As an extension of previous analyses by others, I analyzed the responses to changes in fecundity and yearling survival of age-structured matrix and individual-based population models of 17 populations comprising 10 species. Simulations of the matrix models showed that the magnitude of population responses, but not the relative order of species sensitivity, depended on the state (sustainable or undergoing excessive removals) of the population. Matrix and individual-based models predicted population responses that appeared to be unrelated to their species-level life history traits when responses were plotted on a three-end-point life history surface. Density-dependent adult growth was added to the lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) matrix model, and simulations demonstrated the potential importance to predicted responses of density-dependent processes outside the usual spawner-recruit relationship. Four reasons for the lack of relationship between population responses and life history traits related to inadequate population models, incorrect analysis, inappropriate life history model, and important site-specific factors are discussed.

AB The size and configuration of marine reserves best suited to reaching fisheries and conservation goals are poorly understood. It has been suggested that variable spacing between reserves is essential to the success of a system of marine reserves. We used numerical models to examine the effect of variable spacing on the efficacy of marine reserves for managing a fish species with sedentary adults and planktonic larvae. Variability in reserve spacing affected catch and recruitment relative to values for a uniform configuration of reserves only for populations near collapse even in the presence of a system of reserves. For species with low fishing rates or large marine reserves, variability in spacing had only a minor effect. At high fishing rates and small reserve sizes, variable reserve placement had a positive local effect on catch and recruitment when several reserves fell close to each other. These configurations led to uneven spatial distributions with greater catch and recruitment in areas with a higher concentration of reserves. Variable reserve spacing can offer additional protection to overfished populations along certain sections of the coastline, but concern for spatial homogeneity will argue for a uniform distribution of reserves covering an adequate proportion of the entire coastline.

   deployment
ID RHYNCHOSPORIUM-SECALIS; PATHOGENIC VARIATION
AB A 3-year experiment was established in 1998 to determine whether barley cultivar rotation could be used to reduce the impact of leaf diseases while maintaining crop productivity. Treatments consisted of various sequences of two cultivars with varying degrees of scald and net blotch resistance, 'Kasota', and 'AC Lacombe'; a previously scald-resistant cultivar 'CDC Earl'; a susceptible check, 'Harrington'; and a nonhost, triticale, cultivar 'Wapiti'. In 1998, significant differences in scald severity occurred among the barley cultivars tested. In 1999, significant rotation differences occurred for scald and net blotch severity as well as for PCR-based assay results for scald infection of grain. In general, disease severity was highest and yield was lowest when a barley cultivar was grown on its own residue, especially for cultivars other than 'Kasota'. Contrasts indicated that yield and kernel weight were lower, while scald and net blotch levels and PCR-based assay results were higher, for barley cultivar monoculture than for barley cultivar rotation. In 2000, when a barley cultivar was grown on its own residue, scald severity was usually higher compared with barley cultivar rotation. A similar trend was also observed for net blotch, except for the cultivars 'Kasota' and 'CDC Earl'. Poor stand establishment in some plots precluded the detection of yield differences among some treatments in 2000. Contrasts for 2000 indicated that higher levels of scald and net blotch, and decreased kernel and test weights, occurred for barley cultivar monoculture compared with barley cultivar rotation. In both 1999 and 2000, barley planted on triticale residue generally had higher yield, higher kernel weight and test weight, and lower disease levels compared with barley planted on barley residue. Barley cultivar rotation can be used as a short-term strategy to help reduce leaf disease levels and maintain crop productivity for Alberta barley producers, when rotational options are limited because of livestock feed requirements or market factors. However, long-term sustainable leaf disease management likely would require the introduction of rotations with alternative crops such as triticale, or the implementation of other methods of adding diversity, to cropping systems focused on the intensive production of livestock feed.

AB In order to reduce the volume of ceramic waste from the construction industry, it is possible, among other applications, to use it as aggregates in the production of non-structural concrete artefacts. The main characteristics of such aggregates as well as those of the fresh and hardened concrete made with them (after a standardized pre-saturation procedure) are presented here and compared with those of conventional materials (primary stone aggregates and the concretes made exclusively with them), within a larger experimental investigation to maximize the reuse and reutilization of construction and demolition waste. The results show that there is a potential for the use of these ceramic aggregates in elements in which the primary requirement is not compressive strength but tensile strength and abrasion resistance, such as for concrete pavement stabs.

AB The genome of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) is being sequenced by an international consortium of 10 countries (Korea, China, the United Kingdom, India, The Netherlands, France, Japan, Spain, Italy and the United States) as part of a larger initiative called the 'International Solanaceae Genome Project (SOL): Systems Approach to Diversity and Adaptation'. The goal of this grassroots initiative, launched in November 2003, is to establish a network of information, resources and scientists to ultimately tackle two of the most significant questions in plant biology and agriculture: (1) How can a common set of genes/proteins give rise to a wide range of morphologically and ecologically distinct organisms that occupy our planet? (2) How can a deeper understanding of the genetic basis of plant diversity be harnessed to better meet the needs of society in an environmentally friendly and sustainable manner? The Solanaceae and closely related species such as coffee, which are included in the scope of the SOL project, are ideally suited to address both of these questions. The first step of the SOL project is to use an ordered BAC approach to generate a high quality sequence for the euchromatic portions of the tomato as a reference for the Solanaceae. Due to the high level of macro and micro-synteny in the Solanaceae the BAC-by-BAC tomato sequence will form the framework for shotgun sequencing of other species. The starting point for sequencing the genome is BACs anchored to the genetic map by overgo hybridization and AFLP technology. The overgos are derived from approximately 1500 markers from the tomato high density F2-2000 genetic map (http://sgn.cornell.edu/). These seed BACs will be used as anchors from which to radiate the tiling path using BAC end sequence data. Annotation will be performed according to SOL project guidelines. All the information generated under the SOL umbrella will be made available in a comprehensive website. The information will be interlinked with the ultimate goal that the comparative biology of the Solanaceae - and beyond - achieves a context that will facilitate a systems biology approach.

AB The aim of this paper is contributing to the study of the exploitation of the European eel (Anguilla anguilla) in the basin of the French river 'Adour'. This exploitation constitutes the basis of the economy of local professional fishermen, who have recently noticed a diminution of the hunting of elvers. In order to design a sustainable exploitation strategy, we must know as much as possible about eel life cycle. For that purpose, we build a model to describe a phase of eels evolution, their migration upstream the river. Our model is based on the biological details of eels behaviour and constitutes a virtual laboratory, useful to test different hypotheses about eels migration. (c) 2004 Academie des sciences.

AB For 10 years I monitored the population density of threatened medicinal plant species in seven protected areas in the Indian Himalayas. I also documented the indigenous uses of threatened medicinal plants through interviews with 138 herbal healers ( 83 Tibetan healers and 55 Ayurvedic healers) residing in the buffer zone villages of these protected areas. To assess the population status of threatened medicinal plant species, I sampled the 10 major habitat types in the protected areas. In all, I found 60 threatened medicinal plant species during the study period, of which 54 species occurred in the sampling plots. Twenty-two percent of threatened medicinal plant species were critically endangered, 16% were endangered, and 27% were vulnerable. Thirty-two threatened medicinal plant species were endemic to the Himalayan region. The density of threatened medicinal plant species varied with protected areas. The Valley of Flowers protected area had the highest number of threatened medicinal plant species. The "moist" habitat type was richest in these species among all 10 habitat types sampled. Arnebia euchroma (Royle ex Benth.) Johnston and Ephedra gerardiana Wall. ex Stapf. were the most common threatened medicinal plant species. The indigenous groups of healers used these threatened species in curing about 45 different ailments. Based on my findings, I believe that to ensure the long-term sustainability of threatened medicinal plants, medicinal-plant conservation areas should be established.

AB This study characterizes the broad-scale ecology of the St. Elias region of Yukon, Alaska, and British Columbia and assesses the implications for ecosystem-based management of the region's protected areas, including Kluane, Wrangell-St. Elias, and Glacier Bay National Parks, and Tatshenshini-Alsek Provincial Park. An interdisciplinary, map-based process was used to synthesize information, and the fields of regional ecology and ecosystem geography provided the foundation for analysis. Results illustrate that the protected areas share several regional-scale ecosystem components with each other and with surrounding areas, including globally significant populations of large mammals and other wildlife species as well as vegetation communities that experience a full suite of natural disturbances with little human intervention. The valleys of the Tatshenshini, Alsek, and Copper Rivers serve as important links between coastal and interior areas as well as conduits for the movement of biota. However, connectivity is not distributed equally across the region, and the four core national parks have. linkages with adjacent areas that are as strong, and in many cases stronger, than among themselves. The management challenge is not a matter of linking separate protected areas to create networks. Instead, it lies in integrating existing protected areas with each other and with surrounding areas and resisting small changes that have incremental and cumulative impacts. Interagency cooperation is seen as a key component in facilitating this, and some success has been achieved on the scale of single issues and specific resources. The challenge ahead is to build on this success by strengthening existing institutional frameworks and working toward more comprehensive efforts. Similar lessons can be derived for other complex mountain landscapes and northern regions where large protected areas and multiple land management agencies exist.

AB Recent studies have estimated the historical abundance of large marine vertebrates to determine potential targets for conservation. We evaluated this approach using 1990s aerial survey estimates of dugong abundance and an estimate of the decline in,dugong numbers since the 1960s based on changes in the catch per unit effort of dugong bycatch in a government shark control program on the east coast of Queensland, Australia. This analysis indicated that the catch rate of dugongs caught in shark nets, at six locations between latitudes 16.5 degrees S and 28 degrees S, declined at an average of 8.7% per year between 1962 and 1999. This represents a decline to 3.1% of initial catch rates over the sampling period. If the changes in the populations sampled by the shark nets and aerial surveys were equivalent, this result suggests that the region supported 72 000 dugongs in the early 1960s compared with an estimated 4220 dugongs in the mid-1990s. The seagrass habitat in the region. is currently insufficient to support 72000 dugongs, suggesting that our hindcast estimate may be an unrealistic target for recovery. Nonetheless, the evidence of serious dugong decline from the shark-net data and other sources has triggered significant conservation initiatives. This case study indicates that comparisons between historical and contemporary estimates of the abundance of large marine vertebrates can be powerful qualitative triggers for conservation action, but that quantitative targets for recovery require systematic testing of the assumptions underlying hindcast estimates, scientific evaluation of the current carrying capacity of the ecosystem for the target species, and consultation with a broad range of stakeholders. For some species, it may be more productive to set anthropogenic mortality targets that are designed to enable the population to recover to its optimum sustainable population than to set recovery targets per se.

AB The role of ecological science in promoting sound environmental decisions has concerned ecologists worldwide and it has been stressed that the application of ecological knowledge requires new interactive and participatory forms of research, as well as sound partnerships between ecologists and land managers. However, concrete examples of ecological science as part of rural decision making have rarely been examined, especially in intertropical countries. We analyzed interactions between ecological scientists from the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) and a rural indigenous community involved in forest management in Central-Western Mexico. Using qualitative research methods (such as observing participants, conducting interviews; generally focusing on the meanings that social actors give to phenomena), we compared the perspectives of the academic and community sectors in relation to benefits, products, problems, and obstacles faced when conducting integrative forest management. The research showed the relevance of rural communities demanding scientific information for ecosystem management and of academic institutions accepting to respond to these demands. Participatory approaches and continuous communication between sectors were essential for establishing trust and commitment for everyone involved. The obstacles found were related to an academic institution's inability to support such an experience and to accept capacity building of rural managers as part of its scientific mission. We concluded that applied ecological science in developing countries, such as Mexico, should regard rural communities as key ecosystem managers and should respond-to their needs and demands in order to convert pure scientific findings into wise environmental decisions.

AB Using multicointegration methodology, we develop criteria for testing sustainability of fiscal budgeting processes across all states of nature. Criteria are derived from the optimal control literature where levels and rates of change of a system of variables are determinants of policy response. The appropriate policy response mechanisms are outlined and linked to the multicointegration methodology. We then test government spending and revenue systems of 15 industrialized countries for the presence of such mechanisms. We find that only Norway and the United Kingdom exhibit policy responses that are consistent with our criteria.

ID DEPLETION
AB The concept of sustainability implies that the flow of services derived from the use of natural capital must be constant over time and should be obtained at a constant price. For a depletable resource such as oil, the future generations are highly impacted due to the consumption behavior of the current generation. Since the ultimate oil stock within the Earth declines with cumulative consumption, excessive consumption of oil now reduces the availability of oil for future needs. Moreover, since oil reserves are normally extracted in the order of ascending cost and descending quality, excessive consumption of relatively high-quality, cheap oil reserves by the current generation raises the cost at which future generations can meet their needs of oil and hence imposes an external cost on the future generations. This study aims to quantify the external cost of consuming a barrel of oil within the context of sustainable development. An option-pricing model is developed to quantify this external cost assuming that the external cost of consuming a barrel of oil now equals the value of the option to get a barrel of oil in the future at the same current cost. Then, the total cost of consuming a barrel of oil now, that should be used in lifecycle costing to design more sustainable products, is the summation of the oil price and the external cost.

AB This article analyzes effects of insect-resistant Bt cotton on pesticide use and agricultural productivity in Argentina. Based on farm survey data, it is shown that the technology reduces application rates of toxic chemicals by 50 per cent, while significantly increasing yields. Using a damage control framework, the effectiveness of Bt versus chemical pesticides is estimated, and technological impacts are predicted for different farm types. Gross benefits could be highest for smallholder farmers, who are not currently using the technology. The durability of the advantages is analyzed by using biological models to simulate resistance development in pest populations. Rapid resistance buildup and associated pest outbreaks appear to be unlikely if minimum non-Bt refuge areas are maintained. Thus, promoting a more widespread diffusion of Bt cotton could amplify the efficiency, equity, and environmental gains. Conclusive statements about the technology's sustainability, however, require longer-term monitoring of possible secondary effects and farmers' behavior in maintaining refuges.

   Swedish energy policy
SO ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING C-GOVERNMENT AND POLICY
LA English
DT Article
ID SUSTAINABILITY
AB Environmental policy integration (EPI) has been advanced as a guiding policy principle in Europe to ensure that environmental concerns are considered across all areas of policymaking. EPI can be treated analytically as a process of policy learning. The author analyses EPI and other types of learning in Swedish energy policy from the late 1980s up to today. A systematic tracing of agendas, arguments, and policy change indicates that learning processes and partial EPI have occurred. Changing actor configurations and increasing resource dependencies have facilitated learning and EPI, driven in turn by the European deregulation processes, global policy agendas, and the development of the Nordic electricity market. However, learning and EPI has been slow, indirect, and partial-constrained by how policymaking is organised in central government. Further measures are needed to advance EPI in national sector policy, including the development of policy-level strategic assessments and stronger sector accountabilities.

LA English
DT Article
AB This paper discusses what has been learnt from housing and local development programme,,; in Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua supported and funded by the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) during the last 15 years. It identifies common financial mechanisms that have proven to be effective and affordable by the urban poor in their search for better housing. It also discusses the different policies and interventions by national and sub-national governments and the "non-market incentives" that were required to make low-income housing programmes feasible and affordable, and what these imply for the financial and institutional sustainability of such programmes. It ends with recommendations for other international donors and national institutions that are seeking to design new financial services for housing for low-income groups.

TI The role of civil society in urban environmental rehabilitation: a case
   study (Thanh Xuan district, Hanoi, Vietnam)
SO ENVIRONMENT AND URBANIZATION
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper presents the first results of research on a participatory approach to environmental rehabilitation in Thanh Xuan district in Hanoi, Vietnam, that is part of a larger research project that also included four other case studies. The researchers had two main objectives: first, to identify the civil society actors within a socialist, centralized regime where public participation is quite limited; and second, to assess the role of these actors in performing urban environmental management activities - planning and monitoring, urban environmental services delivery, and urban environmental conflict resolution. Findings from the Thanh Xuan case study suggest that members of the organizations that took part benefited from their participation in the areas of training, empowerment and capacity development. However, the benefits did not seem sustainable, as they were the outcome of international aid and support, and few mechanisms existed to ensure their continuation.

TI Transferring responsibility from an international NGO to local
   government: experience from the Yala Urban Health Programme, Nepal
SO ENVIRONMENT AND URBANIZATION
LA English
DT Article
AB This article describes the response of the Yala Urban Health Programme and its predecessors to urban health problems in Patan, Nepal, over 20 years. The initial response was to take responsibility for filling the gap in essential services; however, since 1998, the response has changed, to become an eight-year phased transfer of responsibility to local government, with the following goal:
   "To improve the health of all in Patan, particularly the poor and marginalized, by establishing an effective, accessible and sustainable primary health care system. This will be a public-private-NGO partnership coordinated by the city council."
   Six years into the process, there are encouraging signs that local government will indeed take up the challenge of coordinating essential health services for the city. We describe here the factors we believe have contributed to a successful handover, some of the problems encountered so far and the uncertainties that remain. Perhaps the most important factor for success is that leaders in the international NGO and the municipality have been willing to take risks. By modelling an attitude of service and valuing the service given by others, the balance of risk may have been tipped in favour of success.

DT Article
DE environmental impact assessment; collaborative management;

ID INDIGENOUS KNOWLEDGE; MANAGEMENT; SYSTEMS
AB Recent trends in environmental assessment theory and practice indicate a growing concern with collaboration and learning. Although there are few examples of the institutional, organizational, and socio-political forms and processes required to foster this collaboration and learning, the establishment of an environmental planning, management, and assessment regime in Canada's Northwest Territories offers useful insights. Consequently, this paper identifies and examines the institutional, organizational, and socio-political conditions that have encouraged more collaborative forms of environmental assessment practice in the Northwest Territories. Key issues highlighted include: (1) the development of decentralized regulatory organizations more responsive to changing circumstances; (2) strategies for more effective communication and participation of community interests; (3) efforts to build a collaborative vision of economic and social development through region-specific land use plans; (4) the integration of knowledge frameworks; and (5) a concern with the capacity required to encourage effective intervention in the assessment process.

ID STRATEGIC ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT; IMPACTS; EVENTS
AB Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) is a procedural tool and within the framework of SEA, several different types of analytical methods can be used in the assessment. However, the impact matrix used currently in Taiwan has some disadvantages. Hence, a Delphi-matrix approach to SEA is proposed here to improve the performance of Taiwan's SEA. This new approach is based on the impact matrix combination with indicators of sustainability, and then the Delphi method is employed to collect experts' opinions.
   In addition, the assessment of National Floriculture Park Plan and Taiwan Flora 2008 Program is taken as an example to examine this new method. Although international exhibition is one of the important tourism (economic) activities, SEA is seldom about tourism sector. Finally, the Delphi-matrix approach to SEA for tourism development plan is established containing eight assessment topics and 26 corresponding categories. In summary, three major types of impacts: resources' usages, pollution emissions, and local cultures change are found. Resources' usages, such as water, electricity, and natural gas demand, are calculated on a per capita basis. Various forms of pollution resulting from this plan, such as air, water, soil, waste, and noise, are also identified. (c) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The lower Roanoke River in North Carolina, USA, has been regulated by a series of dams since the 1950s. This river and its floodplain have been identified by The Nature Conservancy, the US Fish and Wildlife Service, and the State of North Carolina as critical resources for the conservation of bottomland hardwoods and other riparian and in-stream biota and communities. Upstream dams are causing extended floods in the growing season for bottomland hardwood forests, threatening their survival. A coalition of stakeholders including public agencies and private organizations is cooperating with the dam managers to establish an active adaptive management program to reduce the negative impacts of flow regulation, especially extended growing season inundation, on these conservation targets. We introduce the lower Roanoke River, describe the regulatory context for negotiating towards an active adaptive management program, present our conservation objective for bottomland hardwoods, and describe investigations in which we successfully employed a series of models to develop testable management hypotheses. We propose adaptive management strategies that we believe will enable the bottomland hardwoods to regenerate and support their associated biota and that are reasonable, flexible, and economically sustainable.

AB Integrated approaches to urban stormwater drainage management are being increasingly advocated as necessary for advancing more sustainable and holistic management of urban water environments. In this paper, the status of integrated approaches in the management of urban stormwater discharges to receiving waterways is summarized. The starting point of the paper is with the recent scientific contributions, revealing that integration is being pursued and implemented predominantly at two conceptual levels. These include 1) integrating the technical system with the receiving waterway environment, and 2) considering the interaction and influence of the human system with the technical system through processes such as stakeholder and public participation. Additionally, it is argued that the evolving shift towards the implementation of water-quality-based strategies advances the need for further development and application of integrated models and approaches. The cases of online physically based models for predictive control and integrated source control and public participation are presented as examples of such ongoing developments in pursuit of integrated urban stormwater management.

AB Desertification directly threatens more than 250 million people and one third of the earth's land surface. Although it is well known that desertification could be reversed in most cases if the intensity of land use were reduced, there have been no studies on how to achieve this reversed desertification on a large scale. We conducted a case study in Hunshandak Sandland of North China, exploring how creation of a nature reserve might aid restoration of a degraded ecosystem. Experimental data indicated that desertified regions, if designated as a nature reserve, could be restored with conservation of biodiversity. The buffer zones in moderately desertified lands could serve as a base for forage production and/or ecotourism industry. The construction of ecologically designed towns (ecotowns) in transition zones could accommodate migrants moved from core zones so as to develop stock production, related industry, and ecotourism, enabling both economic and environmental development. Up to now, 5778 local inhabitants in the core zones of Zhenglan Banner (county) in the Hunshandak Sandland have been moved out of the severely degraded areas with the financial assistance of the central government. Those people have been moved into three eco-towns of the Banner with an objective of greatly enhancing the economic and social status while restoring the degraded sandlands.

AB As cities grow they first impose substantial stress on their surrounding water environment, but then, as comprehensive wastewater infrastructure is installed. much of that stress is removed. It becomes possible to talk of rehabilitated watersheds. in which the river network, with its re-invigorated ecological health, passes through the urban landscape of (now) potentially intense polluting activities. Surface water quality becomes vulnerable to the transient pollution events arising from all manner of accidents. faults. failures, and contaminated-runoff events associated with the city's metabolism. including unreliability in the performance of its wastewater infra structure. The paper examines the role of High-Performance Integrated Control (H-PIC)-a combination of real-time control (RTC) and Integrated Urban Water Management (IUWM)-as an approach essential to managing water quality in such intensively developing watersheds. Rather than promoting H-PIC as the logical stage of operations that will follow planning. design, and construction in the life cycle of an infrastructure, discussion is set in the context of the sustainability of cities. in particular, in association with a measure of sustainability expressed in terms of the frequency spectrum of disturbances to which the aquatic environment is subject. In this more strategic setting, it is argued that control engineering (for achieving H-PIC) should be seen as having relevance beyond merely its conventional interpretation of closed-loop unit-process; automation, e.g., in opening up analyses of the stability and ecological resilience of an entire urban water infrastructure. It is acknowledged that "integration", as in IUWM and H-PIC, is likely to be realized in practice. because of the need for it expressed in the highest political circles of the sustainability debate. Given this, the paper examines the implications of the ongoing shift-from the technocracy of the past century to the democracy of stakeholder participation in the present century-for the more widespread use of information and communication technologies in managing water quality in urban water environments.

AB Rising expectations concerning levels of service, protection of the environment and enhanced sustainability are putting increasing demands oil the urban wastewater system. The conventional approach to design and operation of the system considering each component separately, cannot provide the gains in performance required. However. with recent gains in the understanding and modeling of the system it is now possible to represent the system as a whole and to optimize its performance. This paper describes the development and benefits of integrated modelling of the operation and control of urban wastewater systems and describes the development of a simulation package SYNOPSIS. SYNOPSIS encompasses sub-models of the sewer system treatment plant and river, based on commonly accepted modeling approaches. The sub-models are linked in a parallel way allowing interactions between these sub-systems to be fully considered. This feature, used in concert with a control module implemented in the software, proves to be of particular importance for the development and analysis of integrated real-time control strategies. The model is applied to a case stud), site where it is clearly shown that river quality call be significantly improved by implementing an integrated control strategy as compared with the conventional passive or local control scenario. It is also shown how the application of conventional criteria (e.g. overflow volumes, discharged pollutant loads) can result in misleading conclusions when assessing the performance of the urban wastewater system under various scenarios. The paper argues that it is no longer necessary to use such simplified criteria. but using the software and techniques outlined, it is now feasible to operate complete urban wastewater systems to maximize river water quality directly. Furthermore, simulation results indicate the clear potential of integrated control even for catchments where local control provides hardly any benefits. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Globalization is patently changing our understanding of environmental politics. It relates to environmental problems in two ways. First, environmental problems and their effects are global, and hence solutions beyond the remit of nation states are required. Second, globalization may benefit local-global relationship and contribute to the realization of a sustainable society. These points obviously influence green political theory since one of its tasks is to understand the transformation of political community in the context of the global scope of environmental problems. One route is through laying the foundations for an autochthonous idea of citizenship namely, ecological or environmental citizenship. The goal of this article is to explore the connections between cosmopolitan reflections on citizenship on the one hand, and green political theory's attempts to develop its own idea of citizenship, on the other. It is argued that although the idea of ecological citizenship may be regarded as a kind of cosmopolitan or global citizenship, its features and current degree of development move towards a new kind of citizenship.

AB The most common policy strategies for promoting sustainable development are regulatory and economic. However, there is increasing interest in an alternative or complementary idea, namely, 'environmental citizenship'. This article seeks to develop a particular interpretation of environmental citizenship. It is argued that a consistent political liberalism must conceive of its citizens as 'citizens of an environment'. An account of liberal environmental citizenship is proposed, and the rights and duties of the liberal environmental citizen are outlined and discussed.

AB Social citizenship, an idea and practice that is currently undergoing substantial reconsideration, is often regarded as requiring high economic growth and the spread of the market economy and formal work. But this may have consequences for sustainability. To consider whether or not sustainability and social citizenship are compatible, the notion of social citizenship is here divided into three elements of social commitment: industrial, waged and contractual. The analysis attempts to reveal the extent to which the nature of social citizenship has been transformed. and examines its relationship with sustainability and the idea of ecological citizenship.

AB Ecological citizenship is a justice-based account of how we should live, based upon private and public action to reduce the environmental impacts of our every day lives on others. This paper examines ecological citizenship at perhaps its most mundane, yet its most ubiquitous and fundamental level: the choices and actions which individuals and households make on a daily basis, in the supermarket and on the high street. 'Sustainable consumption' has become a core policy objective of the new millennium in national and international arenas, anti the paper critically evaluates the UK policy model of sustainable consumption as a tool for ecological citizenship. It first reviews the debate about sustainable consumption and describes two competing perspectives: one concerned with reform of the mainstream. and another more radical alternative. It then appraises the mainstream policy model of sustainable consumption in the light of ecological citizenship goals, and identifies a number of failures, Turning to the alternative perspective of sustainable consumption. a member of initiatives tire discussed which are able to overcome the limitations of the mainstream model in enabling individual consumers to be good ecological citizens. Finally, the policy implications of this analysis tire drawn out in order to nurture the practice of ecological citizenship.

AB This research study focused on the biotreatability of waste beer in an anaerobic environment. A comparison of two bioreactors, ASBR (anaerobic sequencing batch reactor) and UASB (upflow anaerobic sludge blanket) reactors, was performed. The experiments were carried out in the two reactors under identical conditions at room temperature and 351 C under organic loading rates (OLRs) from 2 to 20 kg chemical oxygen demand (COD) m(-3) day(-1). The results show that the performance in the ASBR was better than that in the UASB reactor without a recirculation system at the two temperatures under all organic loading levels. In the ASBR, soluble COD reductions of 95 to 57% and 93 to 70% were obtained as the OLR increased from 2 to 20 kg COD m(-3) day(-1) at room temperature and 350 C, respectively. In the UASB reactor without a recirculation system., the soluble COD reduction was 78 to 49% and 80 to 65% under the same increase in OLR as the ASBR at room temperature and 35 degrees C, respectively. Methane production was measured in the ASBR at both temperatures. Results for methane production were close to the expected yields of 0.39 m(3)/kg COD removed for an OLR of 2 to 6 kg COD m(-3) day(-1), and lower than the expected valuesfor an OLR of 8 to 20 kg COD In m(-3) day(-1). Therefore, anaerobic treatment of beer is sustainable by both reactors if the organic load is limited to 6 kg COD m(-3) day(-1). (c) 2004 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog,

AB We provide an overview and introduction to the emerging field of trade and renewable resources, and discuss the potential impact of trade liberalization on welfare and resource conservation. A key factor determining the effect of trade reform is the institutional context or property rights regime, and our survey is organized such that it loosely follows the development of new insights with respect to institutions in this literature. This implies a transition from the benevolent planner's model to the polar opposite benchmark of open access in the 1990s. Currently the pendulum is swinging back towards management and regulation, but institutions are treated as endogenous. We discuss and compare various key models in some detail and search for common ground between protagonists and antagonists of free trade.

AB Accurate estimates of forest productivity are required for sustainable forest management. Height of dominant and codominant trees at a reference age is often used as a measure of site productivity. Eight algebraic difference equations based on the models proposed by Sloboda, Bertalanffy-Richards, Korf, Hossfeld, and McDill-Amateis were tested on the transformed, longitudinal data structure that considers all possible growth intervals. Autocorrelation was modelled by expanding the error term as an autoregressive process according to this data structure. Generalized nonlinear least squares methods were used for model fitting. Several numerical and graphic analyses were used to compare the different candidate models. The relative error in dominant height prediction was used to select 60 years as the best reference age. An algebraic difference equation based on the model proposed by Korf provided the best compromise between biological and statistical aspects and produced the most adequate site index curves. This model is therefore recommended for height growth prediction and site classification of pedunculate oak stands in Galicia. The model is polymorphic and base-age invariant, having only one asymptote. Predictions of height for age intervals between t(1) and t(2) of more than 15 years should be considered with caution because of the associated critical error.

AB The West and Central Africa Collaborative Maize Research Network (WECAMAN) was established in 1987 to strengthen the capacity and capability of national programmes of West and Central Africa (WCA) to tackle regional constraints to maize production. The Network created several mechanisms for implementing, monitoring and evaluating maize research and development activities, including research project development and implementation, attendance and quality of paper presentation at technical conferences organized by the Network, scientific monitoring tours, consultation visits, mid-term reviews, and end-of-project reviews and impact assessment. WECAMAN's approach to the system of allocating research responsibilities and competitive grants resulted in increased research efficiency and the generation of sustainable technologies that have catalysed increased maize production in the region.

DE developing countries; immunotherapies; R&D; vaccines
AB The great advances in vaccine R&D over the last 20 years have not been paralleled by the regular introduction of new vaccines into the market thus far. This situation acquires more dramatic proportions in developing countries, where preventable infectious diseases still impose a major public health problem. Furthermore, most of the now developments are being conceived to target the market of industrialized countries and it is foreseeable that their introduction in low-to-middle income countries will be difficult if at any time possible. Strengthening their own capacities for R&D and production is likely to be the most reasonable avenue to ensure that new vaccines will become a sustainable reality for developing countries. Concerted efforts that draw together local capacities (industry and academy) with the experience of large global manufacturers, could have a major impact and provide a great example of an effective partnership to achieve this.

ID ADJACENT FISHERY; MARINE PARK
AB The perceptions of Kenyan resource users and managers towards gear and area management were examined through face-to-face interviews to identify areas of agreement and disagreement and compare with compliance. Opinions were sought about gears that sustained fish catch, gears discouraged by the government and traditional leaders, and the benefits of area management were sought. There was good agreement among most groups and traditional leaders about the gears discouraged by government, with beach seines and spear guns the most commonly listed. This indicates good agreement between government and traditions, promoted by recent government legislation, but compliance was poor since nearly two-thirds of fishers used these recently prohibited gears. This was due, in part, to lesser agreement concerning gears that promote a sustainable fishery, with spear guns and beach seines scaled low, but moderately supported in this respect by those fishers that use these gears. These gears persist because of the lack of shared evidence about the yields and sustainability of the various gears and social and economic aspects, such as increased competitiveness and decreased costs of the gears. There is evidence that beach seines lower yields but this gear persists because it is more competitive and has lower costs to the user than the other gears. Spear guns also persist because young and poor fishermen, who cannot afford costs associated with other gears, use them. Government employees scaled the benefits of area, and particularly closed area, management, higher than fishers, which is an issue of conflict but, nonetheless, has good compliance because of the long history of closed area management. For both types of management, shared perceptions alone were insufficient to achieve high compliance, and active enabling and enforcement by managers is needed.

ID SUSTAINABILITY
AB Bycatch production in the recently developed monkfish (Lophius gastrophysus) fishery off southern Brazil was assessed from 14 observer trips conducted by a chartered gillnet fleet during 2001. Catch composition and discard ratios were estimated in 523 selected sets conducted between latitudes 22 degrees 44'S and 34 degrees 21'S and longitudes 33 degrees 37'W and 52 degrees 23V and between the 132 and 607 m isobaths. The monkfish constituted on average 40.7% of all organisms entangled in each observed set. Among non-targeted species geryonid crabs (mostly the royal crab, Chaceon ramosae) and spider crabs (Majidae) were the main components representing 22.6% and 8.5% of total entangled organisms, respectively. The remaining 23% included mostly teleosts and elasmobranchs, such as beard fish (Polimixia lowei), silver john dory (Zenopsis conchiffer), gulf hake (Urophycis cirrata), argentine hake (Merluccius hubbsi), angel shark (Squatina argentina) and various skates (Rajidae). Geryonid crabs and angel sharks were the most retained and processed bycatch components (88.8, 50.0% of numerical catches, respectively). Discard ratios were higher than 75% in all other species entangled by gillnets, including abundant or valuable species, such as the wreckfish (Polyprion americanus). Catch rates of large-size bycatch components, such as dolphins, birds, sharks, rays and the wreckfish were poorly correlated with fishing effort and seem to have been mostly affected by the overlap between these species concentrations or higher diversity areas and the southernmost monkfish fishing grounds. Geryonid and majid crabs were correlated with monkfish catches and fishing effort, being most frequently caught north of 29 degrees S. This pattern was related not only to a target/not-target species distribution area overlap, but also to an elevated vulnerability of these crustaceans to gillnet operations. Proposed measures for bycatch reduction in the monkfish fishery in future, include area closures within monkfish southern fishing grounds and effort reduction measures. Whereas the former would minimize mortality on wreckfish, angel shark and also royal crab populations, effort reduction would benefit particularly the royal crab, which constitutes a conflict aspect of deep-water trap and gillnet fishery development off southern Brazil.

TI Effects of fishing on growth traits: a simulation analysis

AB Fisheries often target individuals based on size. Size-selective fishing can create selection differentials on life-history traits and, when those traits have a genetic basis, may cause evolution. The evolution of life-history traits affects potential yield and sustainability of fishing, and it is therefore an issue for fishery management. Yet fishery managers usually disregard the possibility of evolution, because little guidance is available to predict evolutionary consequences of management strategies. We attempt to provide some generic guidance. We develop an individual-based model of a population with overlapping generations and continuous reproduction. We simulate model populations under size-selective fishing to generate and quantify selection differentials on growth. The analysis comprises a variety of common life-history and fishery characteristics: variability in growth, correlation between von Bertalanffy growth parameters (K and L-infinity), maturity rate, natural mortality rate (M), M/K ratio, duration of spawning season, fishing mortality rate (F), maximum size limit, slope of selectivity curve, age at 50% selectivity, and duration of fishing season. We found that each characteristic affected the magnitude of selection differentials. The most vulnerable stocks were those with a short spawning or fishing season. Under almost all life-history and fishery characteristics examined, selection differentials created by realistic fishing mortality rates are considerable.

AB In the process of searching for sustainable trajectories in the food system, this paper reviews and discusses the importance of tightening feedback loops between ecosystems, actors in the food production chain and consumers. Intensification, specialization, distancing, concentration and homogenization are trends identified as major constraints for tightened feedback loops. These trends can mask or make it possible to disregard feedback signals from unhealthy ecosystems and weaken communication in the food chain. We explore possibilities for improved feedback management on local to global scales and present examples where feedback loops have been tightened. Enhanced communication between the actors in the food system and consciousness of ecological feedback, through e.g., increased reliance on local resources, are possibilities for improvement. However, where distances between resource and resource user are too large, feedback has to be directed through institutions on an overarching level, e.g., policy measures or environmental and social labelling of products.

AB 1. Harvest-related poisoning events are common in tropical streams, yet research on stream recovery has largely been limited to temperate streams and generally does not include any measures of ecosystem function, such as leaf breakdown.
   2. We assessed recovery of a second-order, high-gradient stream draining the Luquillo Experimental Forest, Puerto Rico, 3 months after a chlorine-bleach poisoning event. The illegal poisoning of freshwater shrimps for harvest caused massive mortality of shrimps and dramatic changes in those ecosystem properties influenced by shrimps. We determined recovery potential using an established recovery index and assessed actual recovery by examining whether the poisoned reach returned to conditions resembling an undisturbed upstream reference reach.
   3. Recovery potential was excellent (score = 729 of a possible 729) and can be attributed to nearby sources of organisms for colonisation, the mobility of dominant organisms, unimpaired habitat, rapid flushing and processing of chlorine, and location within a national forest.
   4. Actual recovery was substantial. Comparison of the reference reach with the formerly poisoned reach indicated: (1) complete recovery of xiphocaridid and palaemonid shrimp population abundances, shrimp size distributions, leaf breakdown rates, and abundances of oligochaetes and mayflies on leaves, and (2) only small differences in atyid shrimp abundance and community and ecosystem properties influenced by atyid shrimps (standing stocks of epilithic fine inorganic and organic matter, chlorophyll a, and abundances of chironomids and copepods on leaves).
   5. There was no detectable pattern between any measured variables and distance downstream from the poisoning. However, shrimp size- distributions indicated that the observed recovery may represent a source- sink dynamic, in which the poisoned reach acts as a sink which depletes adult shrimp populations from surrounding undisturbed habitats. Thus, the rapid recovery observed in this study is consistent with results from other field studies of pulse chlorine disturbances, harvest-related fish poisonings, and recovery of freshwater biotic interactions, but it is unlikely to be sustainable if multiple poisonings deplete adult populations to the extent that juvenile recruitment does not offset adult shrimp mortality.

AB A typical altitudinal sequence of four soil profiles from one of the uppermost areas of the Mantiqueira Highlands (Minas Gerais State, southeastern Brazil) was studied regarding physical, chemical, mineralogical and micromorphological attributes. The soils were classified as a Terric Haplosaprist, a Humic Xanthic Hapludox, a Typic Haplorthod and a Humic Psammentic Dystrudept. All soils are gibbsitic, highly acidic and distrophic, with high aluminium saturation. The high organic carbon content and coarse texture favour the occurrence of podzolization. Intense hydrolysis and mineral dissolution occur in the studied pedoenvironments, with the presence of adsorbed Al polymers and organic matter bound Al forms. Podzolization can only be confirmed with the combined analysis of soil humic fractions, Al forms and micromorphological attributes. The conspicuous presence of gibbsite is attributed to past conditions of deep weathering and saprolite formation. Closed nutrient cycling is essential for environmental sustainability due to the very low nutrient reserve of soils and deep pre-weathered saprolites. The highland subtropical environment is an important site of natural carbon immobilization in the tropics in which histic/humic horizons are the most important loci of carbon inputs.

AB Little is known about the sustainability of irrigated oasis agriculture in northern Oman. The objective of this study therefore was to examine which factors allowed agricultural productivity to be apparently maintained during the two millema of a mountain oasis' existence. Soil moisture and physico-chemical properties were measured in a typical flood-irrigated field sown to alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.). Particle size, organic (C-org) and inorganic carbon content, pH and electrical conductivity (EC) of the soil profile were analyzed at 0.15, 0.45 and 1.00 in. Saturated hydraulic conductivity and the soil's apparent bulk density and water potential were determined from undisturbed samples at 0,05, 0.25 and 0.60 in. During irrigation cycles of 6-9 days, volumetric water contents ranged from 30% to 13%. A tracer experiment with potassium bromide revealed that 52-56% of the irrigation water was stored in the upper 0.4 in of the soil. The rest of the water moved further down the profile, thus providing the necessary drainage to avoid the build-up of toxic salt concentrations. Due to differences in pore size, plant-available water in the topsoil amounted to 18.7% compared to 13% and 13.5% at 0.25- and 0.60-m depth, respectively. The aggregate structure in the upper 1.0 in of the profile is likely preserved by concentrations of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) from 379 to 434 mg kg(-1) and C-org from 157 to 368 mg kg(-1) soil. The data indicate that the sustainability of this irrigated landuse system is due to high water quality with low sodium but high CaCO3 concentration, the elaborate terrace structure and water management which allows adequate drainage.

AB Places experience forest transitions when declines in forest cover cease and recoveries in forest cover begin. Forest transitions have occurred in two, sometimes overlapping circumstances. In some places economic development has created enough non-farm jobs to pull farmers off of the land, thereby inducing the spontaneous regeneration of forests in old fields. In other places a scarcity of forest products has prompted governments and landowners to plant trees in some fields. The transitions do little to conserve biodiversity, but they do sequester carbon and conserve soil, so governments should place a high priority on promoting them. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB To accomplish the objectives and the outcomes of the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD), African leaders have agreed, among other things, to subject their countries to peer review through the use of a unique and innovative African Peer Review Mechanism (APRM). This paper analytically describes and assesses the APRM. It contends that peer review represents a sea of change in the thinking of African leaders as they seek to reverse the trend of lack of accountability, political authoritarianism, state failure, and corruption to embrace and consolidate democracy as well as effect sound and transparent economic management. It is further argued that peer review would provide a number of benefits to those countries that subject themselves to it and that, in turn, would have positive multiplier effects on Africa's development performance.

ID MARKETS
AB Italian pharmaceutical policy has recently moved towards a "two lanes" approach, with regulation differing according to a drug's patent status. This study analyses the Italian regulatory framework, focusing on policies related to "off-patent" drugs. Three main regulatory innovations have been examined: (i) generics, introduced in Italy for the first time in 1996; (ii) the reference pricing (RP) scheme, under which consumers pay part of the cost of high-priced products; (iii) pharmacists' right of substitution, supported by a regressive margins system.
   The recent reforms are already producing some worthwhile results, at least in terms of competitive pressure on the (few) substances that run out of patent protection. However, further intervention could be required to achieve long-term sustainability. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

   SYLT
AB In the southern North Sea, coastal people commenced with habitat conversions 1,000 years ago. Partly interrupted in late medieval times by large-scale inundations of marshland, progressive embankments transformed the landward half of the amphibic transition zone between a limno-terrestric and a brackish-marine ecosystem into arable land and freshwater lakes. Sea walls rigidly separated the land from the sea. Dynamic transitional habitats have vanished. Areal loss has diminished the capacity of the Wadden Sea to dissipate wave and tidal energy. A coastal ecosystem once rich in marsh plants, seagrass and diatoms on mud flats became transformed into one with less autochthonous phototroph production, dominated by sandy tidal flats, and dependent primarily on allochthonous plankton supply. The large estuaries have been dredged to serve as shipping canals, and have lost most of their former retention and filter capacity. Riverine loads are now flushed right into the North Sea. Symptoms of a syndromatic coastal habitat degradation are diagnosed, leading to a decline in natural habitat diversity. The conventional on-line coastal protection may not achieve a sustainable coastal habitat configuration. At sedimentary coasts immobilised by dikes and petrified shores, a more flexible response to sea level rise is recommended.

AB Humans have interacted with the Wadden Sea since its origin 7,500 years ago. However, exploitation, habitat alteration and pollution have strongly increased since the Middle Ages, affecting abundance and distribution of many marine mammals, birds, fish, invertebrates and plants. Large whales and some large birds disappeared more than 500 years ago. Most small whales, seals, birds, large fish and oysters were severely reduced by the late 19th and early 20th centuries, leading to the collapse of several traditional fisheries. In the 20th century, conservation efforts have enabled some breeding birds and seals to recover. But other species declined further due to continuing exploitation, habitat destruction, pollution and eutrophication. Moreover, complex three-dimensional habitats such as oyster banks, Sabellaria reefs and subtidal eelgrass beds have been lost completely. In contrast, several opportunistic species such as gulls, polychaetes, green algae and exotic invaders increased during the 20th century. Taken together, multiple human impacts have caused dramatic losses of large predators and habitat-building species in the Wadden Sea over the last 500 years. Although still of high natural value and global importance, the Wadden Sea is a fundamentally changed ecosystem. On the other hand, reduced hunting pressure, increased habitat protection and reduced river pollution have enabled the recent recovery of several species and an increase in environmental quality. These successes, together with a historical vision of what was once possible, should guide current and future conservation, restoration and management efforts towards a more sustainable interaction between man and the sea.

AB The Sun Grant Initiative is a new Act of Congress (Sec. 9011 of Title IX of the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act) that reflects a new vision for the future in agriculture. The Sun Grant Initiative is driven by a national consortium of land grant universities, in coordination with the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Department of Energy. The mission of the Sun Grant Initiative is to 1) enhance national energy security through development, distribution, and implementation of biobased energy technologies; 2) promote diversification and environmental sustainability of America's agriculture through land-grant based research, extension, and education programs in renewable energy and biobased products; and 3) promote opportunities for biobased economic diversification in rural communities. Bioenergy produced on American farms represents an opportunity to both reduce dependence on imported oil and provide a significant source of income to American farmers.

AB This study analyzes land use changes due to human development in the Mkomazi Valley, Tanzania, and its impacts on nature using the SD-Modeling (System Dynamic modeling) technique. Ultimately this method relates environment and economy of society with regard to a seasonal rainfall-based agriculture practice and their harmonization with irrigation agriculture for development sustainability. VENSIM PLE (VENTANA SIMULATION ENVIRONMENT, PERSONAL LEARNING EDITION 2002) software, which simplified the assessment, was used to build a SD-model that accommodated changes in Population, Deforestation, Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and Basin Storage. Model results indicate groundwater behavior, deforestation, public opinion and decreased health of the farmers all relate to changes in land use (i.e., introduction of a rice development project) with its associated environment degradation, deforestation, and poverty due to deforestation. Moreover, these changes might be the cause of animal flight from the Mkomazi game reserve and an increase in human disease and deaths. Finally, it is concluded that uncontrolled human activities and behavior are the main causes of environmental degradation and therefore a brief summary is presented on challenges and opportunities for decision-makers on the sustainable development of the Mkomazi Valley.

ID BELIZE
AB Ecotourism has been heralded as a potential economic and environmental savior in much of Latin America, though explosive foreign investment in ecotourism ventures raises questions about the validity of ecotourism as a tool of sustainable local development. This paper uses three case studies from coastal Belize and the Bay Islands of Honduras to illustrate the challenges that local communities face when attempting to derive ecotourism benefits. Whether these communities are poised to take advantage of foreign capital is largely dependent on their ability to direct the investment and establish control over their common property resources. This appears to require a marked cultural shift toward planning and politicization.

AB Homegardens are integral part of rural households in Bangladesh. The present study examines some physical, biological, and socioeconomic characteristics of 32 homegardens randomly selected from four villages representing different agro-ecological conditions, variable population densities, and market opportunities. The study results suggest that large numbers of plant and animal species occupy homegardens, and their composition and intensity of cultivation vary directly with the household physiologic density and access to urban markets, and inversely with environmental constraints to agriculture. Homegardens form the activity space for household women and children, who perform most homegarden farming tasks. Uses of home generated inputs at no or low cost make homegardens economically more efficient and sustainable compared to non-homegarden rice farming. In the context of the intensive subsistence agriculture patterns that dominate Bangladesh, homegardens contribute significantly to smallholder household income.

AB Recent abundance estimates were combined with historical catches and an age- and sex-structured population dynamic model to perform Bayesian assessments of the walrus (Odobenus rosmarus) populations in West Greenland, the North Water in northern Baffin Bay, and East Greenland. The model assumed density-regulated dynamics and pre-harvest populations in population-dynamical equilibrium. It projected the populations under the influence of the catches to estimate the historical trajectories and the current population status. It was found that the West Greenland and North Water populations have been heavily exploited during the last century with the current abundance being at best only a few per cent of the historical abundance. Apparently these populations are still being exploited above sustainable level. The East Greenland population was heavily exploited after 1889 and during the first half of the 20th century and was depleted to approximately 50% of pristine population size in 1933. After protective measures were introduced in the 1950s this population has increased to a current level close to the abundance in 1889, and the present exploitation appears to be sustainable.

AB Carrying out an effective control of fishing activities is essential to guarantee a sustainable exploitation of sea resources. Nevertheless, as the regulated areas are extended, they are difficult and time consuming to monitor by means of traditional reconnaissance methods such as planes and patrol vessels. On the contrary, satellite-based synthetic aperture radar (SAR) provides a powerful surveillance capability allowing the observation of broad expanses, independently from weather effects and from the day and night cycle. Unfortunately, the automatic interpretation of SAR images is often complicated, even though undetected targets are sometimes visible by eye. Attending to these particular circumstances, a novel approach for ship detection is proposed based on the analysis of SAR images by means of the discrete wavelet transform. The exposed method takes advantage of the difference of statistical behavior among the ships and the surrounding sea, interpreting the information through the wavelet coefficients in order to provide a more reliable detection. The analysis of the detection performance over both simulated and real images confirms the robustness of the proposed algorithm.

AB This paper discusses the relationship between market orientation and organizational learning and, in particular, the former's contribution to the generation of double-loop learning. Although prior contributions on this topic have been controversial, the authors, departing from the principles of RBV, consider market orientation a resource capable of generating higher order organizational learning and, in this way, capable of additionally reinforcing firms' sustainable competitive advantage. The empirical study provides evidence on the existing relationship between a firm's learning and market orientation degree and the organization's economic and non-economic results. Findings indicate that learning orientation stimulates the market-oriented behavior and that it also positively affects the establishment of long-term relationships with strategic clients. Contrary to prior research a significant and positive effect on business performance is only contrasted in the case of market orientation. (c) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Sustainable partnerships for integrated care: the role of decision

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT

DT Article
DE partnerships; integrated care; decision making; environment
AB This paper is intended to further the understanding of the role of the characteristics of decision making and its environment in the development of sustainable partnerships in health care, and to illustrate how this subject can be studied from a combined theoretical and methodological perspective. With the aid of a conceptual model covering sensitizing concepts from contingency theory (that refer to environmental characteristics - particularly institutions - the process course of decision making and its outcomes) and the case study methodology (explanation-building, triangulation, document study and interviews), two Dutch cases were analysed. The findings indicate which environmental characteristics are responsible for the differences in the process course and outcomes between the cases. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ID ENERGY; ECONOMY; FUTURE
AB The potential of hydrogen energy technologies for being recognized as critical technologies (CTs) in the context of sustainable development is briefly discussed in view of the assessment approach and definitions accepted pertaining to CTs by the institutions dedicated to science and technology policy development.
   The concepts of sustainable development, the relationship between the level of national income and the extent of energy utilisation, CTs in general and national CTs (NCTs) are considered for different types of countries at different stages of economic development.
   Views of industry and business sectors on CTs and the roles of governments and universities are emphasized. The influence of public acceptance of hydrogen as a fuel is included.
   It is concluded that in addition to its exceptionally constructive environmental impact at the local, regional and global levels: hydrogen is expected to bring about a substantial change in the present state of affairs by creating a large number of new and diverse technologies, vast employment opportunities in all sectors and by delivering highly efficient and decentralized energy utilisation, free of geopolitical dependence in most cases. In this regard, though hydrogen is considered as a possibility presently, in the near future hydrogen energy technologies will inevitably be recognised as CTs for countries that are consciously adjusting for sustainable development.

AB The aim of this article is to examine the nature of intellectual capital and its role in the value creation processes. In this article, we regard the construct intellectual capital as a holistic management philosophy. We will develop a typology for this holistic management philosophy, in addition to conceptual models to describe and explain contexts pertaining to the various typologies. In conclusion, we will develop an analytical model where intellectual capital is ingrained in a larger operational context in relation to value creation processes. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

SO INTERNATIONAL REGIONAL SCIENCE REVIEW

DE new urbanism; community; place; sociological aspects
ID PLACE
AB Despite of the growing influence of the new urbanism, social science has contributed relatively little to our understanding of the movement's significance. Research hits often focused oil testing hypotheses derived directly from new urbanist claims, rather than posing questions grounded in sociological theory and empirical study of actual transformations of planning, design, and development practice. This article proposes in understanding of the sociology implicit ill the new urbanism as it has organized the reform of professional practice in terms of two distinct ideals: community, with its rhetoric of solidarity based on common feeling, and urbanism, with echoes of an Arendtian conception of the public realm. Although new urbanists have not recognized important social and political implications of their project, their efforts to transform the way we build neighborhoods and cities suggest important lessons for a research agenda and a sociology of place more usefully connected to place-making practice.

ID SUSTAINABILITY
AB The new scenario of water policy favoured by the European Union Directive establishing a framework for Community action in the field of water policy, and by the National Irrigation Plan in Spain, requires sustainable and integrated management of water resources. A total of 119 farmers were surveyed in order to implement a management model in the Lemos Valley District, where irrigation plays a main role. The survey provides a sample of representative farms, from which real-time updated information can be obtained. This information can be used as the basis for decision-making during the process of implementation and development of the management model. In the study area, farms are small and show a high fragmentation level. Moreover, the farmers who in charge of them are old. The state of distribution network forces farmers to abandon irrigation because they lack motivation to irrigate. Therefore, irrigation rehabilitation must be accompanied by socio-economic profile and by technical measures that allow rehabilitation to be undertaken. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

   District, Ningxia, China
SO IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE
LA English
DT Article
DE irrigation; drainage; salinity; sustainable development
AB In the Huinong Canal Irrigation District, Ningxia, China, annually almost half of the amount of irrigation water, which is supplied from the Yellow River, is drained back to the river through an open drainage system. Waterlogging and salinization occur in parts of the irrigated area and part of the water drains to the surrounding desert. While 85-90 % of inflow to the area is irrigation water there are good possibilities for water saving.
   To analyse water movement at field level and resulting drainage needs, from autumn 1998 until spring 2001 observations were made in two experimental areas: Pingluo and Huinong. The data were used for the calibration and validation of three computer models: SWAP, MODFLOW and DUFLOW. Different scenarios of water and salt behaviour in the unsaturated and saturated zone were simulated, as well as the flow through one of the main drains. The effects of various irrigation amounts and groundwater tables on crop growth, percolation and drainage needs were analysed.
   The present average irrigation water application during the growing season is 630 mm. On average 15 % of the supplied water (665 million m(3) yr(-1)) remains in the area. This is mainly irrigation water that was not used by the crops and did not reach the drainage system. It was found that an irrigation level of 75 % of the present practice with a groundwater table of 1.0 m below the surface during the growing season gave the best results. Under such a practice the soil salinity will fluctuate around 3-3.5 dS m(-1) resulting in a good growth of wheat and a yield reduction for maize of about 20 %. When adequate amounts of irrigation water are supplied in combination with local drainage improvements, the areas with middle and low-yielding crops can be reduced, as well as the area of wasteland.

AB Background: In the United States, HIV-infected children and adolescents are aging and using antiretroviral (ARV) therapy for extended periods of time.
   Objective: To assess trends in ARV use and long-term survival in an observational cohort of HIV-infected children and adolescents in the United States.
   Methods: The Pediatric Spectrum of HIV Disease Study (PSD) is a prospective chart review of more than 2000 HIV-infected children and adolescents. Patients were included in the analysis from enrollment until last follow-up.
   Results: Triple-ARV therapy use (for 6 months or more) increased from 27% to 66% during 1997 to 2001 (p < 0.0001, chi(2) for trend). The proportion of patients receiving 3 or more sequential triple-therapy regimens also increased from 4% to 17% during 1997 to 2001 (p < 0.0001, chi(2) for trend), however, and the durability of triple-therapy regimens decreased from 13 to 7 months from the first to third regimen. Survival rates for the 1997 to 2001 birth cohorts were significantly better than for the 1989 to 1993 and 1994 to 1996 cohorts (P < 0.0001).
   Conclusions: Survival rates in the PSD cohort have increased in association with triple-ARV therapy use. With continued changes in ARV regimens, effective modifications in ARV therapy and the sustainability of gains in survival need to be determined.

AB This paper re-examines whether the huge external deficits in the United States for the last few decades are sustainable by using time series methods. Two distinct analytical differences from earlier works are considered. First, the private sector and government are separated to construct the current account identities used in this paper. Second, both the necessary and sufficient conditions for the sustainability of external deficits are explicitly considered. Taking these modifications into consideration, the empirical results of this study do not necessarily reject the hypothesis that external deficits in the US are sustainable. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB We examined the effect of the annealing conditions on cubic-HfN (c-HfN) segregation in N-incorporated hafnium aluminate (HfAlON). Low-temperature activation (850 degrees C, 30 min) leads to the inhibition of c-HfN segregation in HfAlON, which occurs at 1000 degrees C for 30 s. This results in a reduced leakage current of the film in the 850 degrees C annealing. k values of HfAlON (k similar to 22) higher than those of hafnium aluminate are confirmed, through the polarization enhancement by Hf-N bonds without a long-range order of c-HfN. We also checked c-HfN segregation in N-incorporated HfO2 (HfON) and N-incorporated hafnium silicate (HfSiON), by changing the annealing conditions. HfON causes the segregation of Hf2NO2 and c-HfN at the 1065 degrees C spike, whereas HfSiON maintains a homogeneous structure. We also found that, in the case of an excessive annealing of 1050 degrees C for 30 min. HfSiON decomposes to HfO2/c-HfN. We think that the phase separation is thermodynamically favorable in N-incorporated Hf-based dielectrics at this temperature, however, HfSiON is fully sustainable under practical activation conditions for conventional complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor logic devices.

AB Aim: This paper discusses a process for research utilization that overcomes well-known barriers in order to influence clinical decision-making and practice change. Read, Think, Do! is a problem-solving approach to research utilization and practice development which has the potential to overcome barriers to research utilization.
   Background: Any process for research utilization at the practice level needs to overcome numerous barriers in order to influence clinical decision-making and practice change. Access to research-based knowledge is an obvious first step in the evidence-based approach to care delivery, but is clearly inadequate alone in influencing the improvement of practice.
   Discussions: Read, Think, Do! acknowledges the complexity of problem-solving processes from the outset by looking for (1) the evidence, (2) assessing the value to practice, and (3) addressing the social and cultural milieu of the practice setting to ascertain the best strategies for initiating and sustaining practice change. This approach draws distal forms of empirical knowledge that have the capacity to improve patient outcomes into the proximal knowledge base of the clinical nurse. This is achieved by collaboration, planning and evaluation involving all levels of staff and a specialist facilitator, the Clinical Nurse Consultant in evidence-based practice.
   Conclusion: Read, Think, Do! is a method of research utilization and practice development that has the potential to overcome barriers to research utilization and avoid the 'misplaced concreteness' that can occur when trying to fit empiricism into practice. By addressing the breadth and diversity of issues surrounding research utilization in a systematic manner it presents a sustainable method for practice change informed by evidence.

TI Breeding for societally important traits in pigs

AB Pig breeding programs traditionally focus on the genetic improvement of production and reproduction traits that have a clear economic value. Because citizens and consumers increasingly attach value to traits that have little or no direct relationship to production costs or to the price of a product, pig breeding organizations want to pay more attention to societally important traits, such as the welfare and health of pigs, the ecological effects of pork production, and the healthiness and sensory quality of pork. Most societally important traits have an economic and a noneconomic value and are sufficiently heritable for effective genetic selection, although many genetic and phenotypic (co)variances still have to be estimated. However, it often is not clear to a pig breeding organization how it may deal with the noneconomic value of breeding-goal traits. In this study, a retrospective selection-index method is proposed to obtain the proper weights for societally important traits in the breeding goal. First, the genetic-progress space for each breeding-goal trait is explored by increasing the weights, in a stepwise manner, to each societally important trait in the breeding goal, starting from zero. Subsequently, a pig breeding organization can adopt the resulting genetic-progress scenario that it considers most sustainable or most acceptable. The weights underlying the adopted scenario are considered to be the proper breeding-goal weights. The noneconomic value of each societally important breeding-goal trait is found by deducting its economic value from its obtained weight and is thereby expressed in monetary units. In addition to obtaining weights for societally important breeding-goal traits, the proposed method offers the possibility to estimate the societal costs of selecting for economic traits only, as well as the societal benefits and the economic costs of selecting for traits with a noneconomic value. The method is therefore a useful tool for the development of sustainable breeding goals. An example has been worked out for a sow-line breeding program.

TI Stating mechanisms and refining criteria for ecologically successful
   river restoration: a comment on Palmer et al. (2005)
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
LA English
DT Article

ID REHABILITATION; ECOLOGY; STREAMS
AB 1. To encourage more project assessment and reporting of restoration outcomes, Palmer et al. (2005) propose five criteria for assessing the ecological success of river restoration. They also suggest that these criteria should help to clarify which activities should qualify for ecological restoration funding and facilitate consistency about what constitutes an ecologically successful restoration project.
   2. We critique the five criteria and agree they all merit inclusion in an assessment of successful river restoration. However, the practical application of measuring self-sustainability (resilience) following restoration is potentially problematic and an explicit timeframe is needed to evaluate the results of the restoration.
   3. A sixth criterion is proposed that encourages specific hypotheses and/or a conceptual model of the ecological mechanisms by which the proposed activities will achieve their target. This would enhance our understanding of the mechanisms at play for successful river restoration, and provide a more powerful deductive framework likely to lead to appropriate practices that can be applied across rivers. To explore the potential practical applicability of these six criteria, we applied them to a recently published example of river restoration to ascertain its ecological success.
   4. Synthesis and applications. We agree with the criteria proposed by Palmer et al. (2005), although the problems of measuring resilience and defining a timeline for recovery should be addressed. We suggest strengthening the deductive framework of restoration projects by formulating some sort of conceptual model. This step could involve scientists, and be a useful way of involving science more explicitly in restoration activities. Agreed-upon criteria for successful restoration will greatly facilitate evaluation of river ecosystem recovery at the critical broader scales where our knowledge is still limited.

AB 1. There is considerable debate about whether tropical forests can be managed for timber production and to conserve biodiversity. Few 'sustainable forestry' systems have been evaluated adequately in this respect. Microchiropteran bats may be model taxa for this purpose. They are an important component of mammalian diversity, play key roles in forest dynamics and are indicators of disturbance in neotropical forests.
   2. We investigated the effect of Trinidad's periodic block system (PBS) on bat species diversity and community organization. PBS is a polycyclic system of selective logging with a 30-year harvesting rotation. We captured bats in primary forest and PBS-managed forest logged 33, 31, 21, 20 and 10 years previously.
   3. Selective logging did not affect species diversity but did affect community structure. Frugivorous bats were significantly more abundant in logged forest whereas gleaning animalivores were more abundant in primary forest, suggesting that frugivores benefited and gleaning animalivores were adversely affected by logging.
   4. The bat community showed evidence of recovery. The number of years since forest disturbance was positively correlated with the abundance and number of species of gleaning animalivores and negatively correlated with the proportional abundance of the most common species. Gleaning animalivores increased in abundance with forest regeneration, whereas the community became less dominated by a single generalist frugivore.
   5. Synthesis and applications. PBS selective logging appears to be compatible with the conservation of bat diversity. This provides evidence that neotropical forests can be managed for timber production in an ecologically sustainable way and that significant biodiversity conservation efforts can occur outside national parks and nature reserves in areas set aside for sustainable development. PBS could serve as a basic blueprint for sustainable forestry in the Guianan Shield where there are forests similar in species composition to those of Trinidad. Key attributes that could be adopted by many tropical countries to manage their forests in an ecologically sustainable way are a low intensity harvest, a long rotation and multiple controls on harvesting.

AB Based on a hydrogeological survey and geochemical and isotopic technology, a case study of the Shiyang River Basin is presented to illustrate ground-water resources and geochemistry and their changes caused by the impact of human activity in the arid area of Northwest China. The aquifer is mainly recharged by surface water originating in mountain regions, and there is extensive transfer between rainfall, surface water and ground-water. The deep ground-water is old, approximately 40 ka, and was recharged in a colder and wetter climate environment. The shallower water is mainly palaeowater mixed with limited modern recharge. The sources of salinity are from weathering of rock in mountain areas and from higher evaporation leading to higher salinity along the line of ground-water flow. Human activity, in particular large-scale water resources development associated with dramatic population growth in the last 50 years, has led to tremendous changes in the ground-water regime. Recharge has been reduced by 50% and ground-water abstraction exceeds recharge by 0.41 x 10(9) m(3) yr(-1). Consequently, the ground-water level has fallen widely by between 3 and 5 m, with a maximum fall of 35 m in several towns. These hydrological changes have resulted in a serious degradation of the ecosystem. It is suggested that modernized irrigation technology and new regulation to cover water resources management and allocation within the river basin are urgently needed to achieve sustainable development.

AB Objective: This study describes the course of shoulder and neck complaints in a working population over time.
   Study Design and Setting: Questionnaires were administered on neck and shoulder complaints over 3 consecutive years.
   Results: We observed 12-month incidence rates for neck and shoulder complaints of 16% to 18%, 12-month prevalence rates roughly twice as high, and 12-month recurrence rates approximately twice the prevalence rates. Each year, medical care was sought by 21% to 38% of the subjects with neck or shoulder pain, and 13% to 21% were absent from work. Although at the population level the occurrence of neck and shoulder complaints remained constant, the course of complaints within individuals demonstrated a strong episodic nature of neck and shoulder pain. Results from this study suggest that neck and shoulder complaints for most subjects run a recurrent course characterized by a strong variation in occurrence and a self-limiting course.
   Conclusion: These findings suggest that clinical trials should have a sufficiently long follow-up period to demonstrate sustainability of the therapeutic results. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Towards multidisciplinary assessment of older people: exploring the
   change process
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NURSING
LA English
DT Article
DE evidence-based practice; multidisciplinary assessment of older people;
   multifaceted approaches to change
AB Aims and objectives. This paper discusses the process of change that took place in an intervention study of standardized multidisciplinary assessment guidelines implemented in a female ward for older people in a District General Hospital in South London. This study was one of nine implementation projects in the South Thames Evidence-Based Practice Project.
   Background. The relationship between the worlds of research and healthcare practice is uneasy and contested and, as such, is a breeding ground for challenging questions about how evidence can be used to foment change in clinical practice. Recent literature on change highlights the importance of understanding complexity, which informed our approach and analysis.
   Methods. A multifaceted approach to change that comprised evidence-based guidelines, leadership (project leader) and change management was evaluated before and after the implementation by telephone interviews with patients, a postal survey of community staff and interviews with ward staff. A diagnostic analysis of current assessment practice informed the change process. The project leader collected data on adherence.
   Results. This paper draws on descriptive and qualitative data and addresses the links between contextual issues and the processes and pathways of change, informed by theoretical ideas from the change literature. Key themes emerged: working through others and across boundaries, managing uncertainty and unanticipated challenges. Adherence of ward staff to using the multidisciplinary assessment guidelines was high, with evidence of some dissemination to community staff at follow-up. Three years after the project finished the multidisciplinary assessment is still part of routine clinical practice.
   Conclusions. The analysis contributes to understanding about the nursing leadership of change within an interprofessional arena of practice. It highlights the importance of understanding the context in relation to the impact and sustainability of change and thus the utility of conducting a diagnostic analysis in the early stages of implementation. This has implications for developing approaches to change in nursing and interprofessional practice in other settings.
   Relevance to clinical practice. Using research to change practice needs clinical leaders who are supported by the organization and have the skills to implement research evidence, manage uncertainty and build trust with a range of other professionals.

AB The Neotropical stingless bee Melipona quadrifasciata Lepeletier was evaluated for pollinating tomatoes (variety Rodas; long-life hybrid) in greenhouses under plastic and with a hydroponic system and "organic concepts" in Minas Gerais State, Brazil. Flowers not pollinated did not set any fruit. Pollination by bees plus manual pollination did Dot differ from either bee or manual pollination. Maximum fruit diameter, fruit height, and roundness (quotient between maximum fruit diameter and fruit height) were not significantly different between treatments, but fruit visited by M. quadrifasciata had 10.8% less seeds (dry mass) than manual pollination. This apparently low efficiency of M. quadrifasciata pollination was attributed to the overlap of only 30 min between highest bee foraging activity and highest flower stigma receptivity. Thus, it was concluded that M. quadrifasciata is a feasible pollinator of greenhouse tomatoes because of 1) the observed increase in fruit quality with lower mechanical injury than traditional manual pollination, 2) no significant decrease in fruit size, and 3) high price of such product in the market. Some considerations for sustainable use of M. quadrifasciata as greenhouse pollinator are presented. Although techniques for keeping captive colonies of M. quadrifasciata are currently available, the sole current method for acquiring new colonies is removing them from the forest, and if demand was created for large numbers of colonies for commercial use, techniques for captive rearing must be developed to prevent serious declines in wild populations.

AB The paper presents a nonexhaustive survey of the literature designed to explain emergence, size and political sustainability of pay-as-you-go pension systems. It proposes a simple framework of analysis (a small, open, two overlapping generation economy model), around which some variants are displayed. Dictatorship of the median voter is assumed. The text is organized to answer the following questions: (i) Do political equilibria with PAYG pension schemes exist? (ii) Why do they emerge? (iii) What are the conditions for the participation constraint of the pension game to be verified?, and finally, (iv) What is the size of the pension system chosen by the median voter and how is this size influenced by an exogenous (e.g. demographic) shock?

AB A massive effort towards sustainability is necessary to prevent global warming and energy sources impoverishment: both biomass and waste to energy conversion may represent key actions to reach this goal. At the present, state of the art available technologies for biomass and waste to energy conversion are similar and include low to mid efficiency grate incineration or fluidized bed combustion with steam power cycles or mid to high efficiency gas turbine based cycles through integrated gasification technology. Nevertheless, these plants are all available from mid-to-high scale range that can be highly intrusive on protected areas and socially unacceptable. This paper proposes an innovative, low cost, high efficiency plant in which the residue is gasified in the absence of oxygen (pyrolysis), in a rotary kiln, by means of a highly regenerative gas turbine based cycle. Pyrolysis is preferred to gasification, because the syngas obtained has a higher low heating value and produces char or tar as a by-product with an interesting energy content to be re-utilized inside the cycle. Different plant configurations are proposed and discussed through principal thermodynamic variables parametric analysis. Results show that very interesting efficiencies are obtainable in the 30-40% range for every plant scale. This fact shows how IPRP technology can provide an interesting alternative to traditional technologies, especially for the small size (below 5MW). Moreover the IPRP technology provides a unique solution for microscale (below 500 kW) power plants, opening a new and competitive possibility for distributed biomass or waste to energy conversion systems where low environmental and social impact turns into higher interest and positive dissemination effect.

AB Using Cape York Peninsula, Queensland, Australia as a case study, this paper combines field sampling of woody vegetation with cost benefit analysis to compare the social optimality of fire-assisted pastoralism with sustainable forestry. Carbon sequestration is estimated to be significantly higher in the absence of fire. Integration of carbon sequestration benefits for mitigating future costs of climate change into cost benefit analysis demonstrates that sustainable forestry is a more socially optimal land use than fire-assisted pastoralism. Missing markets for carbon, however, imply that fire-assisted pastoralism will continue to be pursued in the absence of policy intervention. Creation of markets for carbon represents a policy solution that has the potential to drive land use away from fire-assisted pastoralism towards sustainable forestry and environmental conservation.

AB Capacity building is widely recognised as a central feature of Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM). Yet, although increased community capacity can potentially empower local communities with the ability to tackle the impacts of socio-economic change, an evaluation of ICZM performance reveals a limited interest in advancing community development initiatives. This weakness is particularly apparent in Scotland. Whilst coastal communities in Scotland have been found to suffer from a range of significant socio-economic problems, Scottish approaches to ICZM have failed to improve local development trajectories. In response, this paper considers the degree to which community based partnerships can assist in the delivery of sustainable development benefits. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID AFRICA
AB Pastoralism is the most dominant land use form in the and rangelands of Sub-Saharan Africa, but this rangeland-based lifestyle is under threat. As a consequence a study was conducted in the Middle Awash Valley of Ethiopia with the main objectives of assessing and comparing the broad perceptions of two pastoral groups (the Oromo ethnic group living in Kereyu-Fantale and the Afar ethnic group living in Awash Fantale) on the usage of the existing rangeland resources, and their views on constraints and possible solutions. Data were collected from 90 Oromo and 55 Afar households. Despite the difference in ethnicity both of these groups share common problems. They derive their main income from the sale of animals and animal products, but with the difference that milk products rank first in the case of the Afar and last in the case of the Oromo. Both pastoral groups depend heavily on native grasses for animal feed and to a lesser extent on woody plants as a source of browse. The majority of respondents were of the opinion that the condition of the rangelands is poor, mainly due to overgrazing, droughts and increases in the human population. Availability of water is also regarded as a problem, mainly by the Oromo. Migration is the first measure taken to solve shortages of livestock feed, but many of the pastoralists replied that migration is an undesirable practise which is mostly done out of necessity. Because of the limited resources most respondents of both groups still prefer communal land tenure where resources are shared. It is concluded that the problems facing the pastoralists in the Middle Awash Valley have been created over many years and the solutions will also require time. With the current approach of the communal grazing systems, sustainable utilisation of the rangeland ecosystem is not possible. Solutions to the poor condition of the existing rangelands will require a definite commitment and full participation not only of the pastoralists, but also of government and non-governmental organisations that are directly or indirectly involved in rangeland resources utilisation, management, conservation and other related activities.

TI Delivering sustainability therapy in Sustainable Development projects
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE Sustainable Development; projects; Malta
AB This paper explores the apparent contradiction between the 'linearity' of most Sustainable Development projects, with time-bound and defined outputs achieved at a fixed cost, and an implied 'circularity' of the theory whereby there is no 'end'. Projects usually have clear parameters within which they are implemented, and the inclusion of elements such as the need for accountability, measurable impact and,value for money' have grown in importance. It could be argued that we live in a 'projectified' and therefore linear world. The paper explores the potential contradiction between 'linearity' and 'circularity', and suggests that one way around this is to frame the project within a form of the Kolb Learning Cycle heuristic. This will facilitate a rationalisation from those implementing the sustainable development project as to why decisions are being made and for whom. If these questions are opened up to the project stakeholders, including beneficiaries, then the Kolb cycle could encourage learning and understanding by all involved. It could also provide Sustainability Therapy to those trapped in processes, which they find orthogonal to their own perceptions. It is suggested that such learning, therapy and reflective practice should be a valid output of the sustainable development project, although typically the focus is only upon the final outputs and how they feed into policy. Ironically funders would be well advised to take a broader perspective in order to achieve true 'value for money' within such projects, even if learning is not an easily measurable or tangible outcome. These points are explored within the context of the wider literature and experience with a sustainable development project undertaken in Malta. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI On measuring wealth: a case study on the state of Queensland

ID FRAMEWORK; AUSTRALIA; INDEX
AB In order for policy makers to plan effectively for sustainable development, there is a need for measures of welfare that consider changes in the natural capital stock. Current measures based on conventional national accounting are flawed because they are based solely on flow measures and do not account for environmental effects. In this paper, we use an expanded measure of wealth to estimate the value of natural capital for Queensland. The state's stock of natural capital is valued at A$355.6 billion, of which non-timber forest resources account for 45.3%, ecosystem services 20.0%, and mineral resources 17.6%. This figure is a conservative estimate of the true value since some significant components such as the ecological and life-support functions of the environment are excluded. The estimates highlight the relative importance of different forms of natural capital and can be used to draw the attention of policymakers to the need to give adequate weight to the value of such services in decision-making processes.

AB The CO2 release of the well-tracheated jumping spider, Marpissa muscosa, and the poorly tracheated, Pardosa lugubris, was tested while animals were running on a treadmill at three different speeds and under a selective elimination of lungs or tracheae. Thus, the influence of a well-developed tracheal system on the metabolism during physical exercise was examined. The CO2 release in intact animals increased with the running speed in both species. The costs of transport (COT) running at the maximal sustainable speed were nearly twice as big in M. muscosa as in P. lugubris. Elimination of one lung by sealing resulted in reduced COT and running times, and increasing anaerobic proportions in metabolism. Effects were greater in P. lugubris than in M. muscosa, indicating that tracheae compensate partly for the lacking lung capacity. Sealing of the tracheae in M. muscosa reduced the COT and the running times only at the highest speed. Results indicate that tracheae in M. muscosa support the aerobic metabolism only at the most intense physical exercise. At low and medium activity, tracheae may play their main role in the local supply of organs that are not involved in running activity.

AB A global forest convention has been advocated for about 15 years, but progress is slow and positions of advocates and opponents appear entrenched. We review several case studies and offer new empirical evidence relating to causes of and remedies for deforestation. We find no evidence to suggest that a forest convention will be effective in halting deforestation. Our data indicate that development assistance may he the most effective approach to save forests in developing countries. It appears that "money speaks louder than words." We conclude that a global forest convention will be ineffective unless accompanied by substantial and well-directed development assistance.

TI Taking stock of the international arrangement on forests
SO JOURNAL OF FORESTRY
LA English
DT Article
AB The nonlegally binding international arrangement on forests (IAF) was established by countries in 2000 to promote management, conservation, and sustainable development of all types of forests and to strengthen long-term political commitment to this end. In 2005, its convening body, the United Nations Forum on Forests (UNFF), reviews the effectiveness of the IAF and deliberates on next steps. The review is likely to find that some of the most effective parts of the arrangement have occurred outside the negotiating chambers of the UNFF. increasing the effectiveness and lasting impact of the arrangement requires that countries integrate forests into the broader international agenda for sustainable development, emphasize the contributions of forests to poverty alleviation and economic development, and, most importantly, translate policy into concrete actions.

ID POLITICS
AB This paper explores the physical and imaginative construction of the Zimbabwean 'lowveld' landscape. A powerful legacy of the colonial encounter with Zimbabwe was the notion that the lowveld is a wilderness. This logic underpinned attempts to preserve or rehabilitate parts of the lowveld landscape as pristine and glorious pieces of national heritage and, more recently, attempts to exploit sustainably 'wilderness quality' and wildlife. The landscape has been physically modified accordingly - often to the detriment of many of its inhabitants. This has played out in oxymoronic attempts to manufacture wilderness in a national park, conservancies and game ranches. But this vision has recently come under its most severe attack to date as these new wildernesses have been re-peopled, and the politics of land and the needs of black smallholders, pushed to the top of the national agenda. The land occupations since 2000 by both state-sponsored war veterans and peasant farmers have revealed starkly contrasting ways of seeing and understanding this landscape which have radically different implications for conservation and development policy.

AB Semi-interpenetrating polymer networks of polypyrrole with poly(esteramide urethane) (CPEAU) synthesized from a sustainable resource, (coconut oil) is being reported for the first time. The semi-IPNs were prepared via chemical polymerization by immersing FeCl3 impregnated CPEAU films in a aqueous pyrrole solution for different time periods. CPEAU-Py semi-IPN films were found to be flexible, stiff, and having satisfactory conductivity when they were prepared by soaking in FeCl3 up to 4 h. Soaking for higher periods led to the deformation of films. Soaking for less than 2 h in FeCl3 resulted into poor polymerization of polypyrrole producing films of poor conductivity. Water uptake resulted in swelling of the films of pure CPEAU and was found to be maximum up to 10 wt%. Water uptake in the FeCl3 impregnated CPEAU films decreased with the increase in the impregnation time and fell up to 5 wt% of FeCl3 impregnated films. Conductivity of the semi-IPN films was found to be in the semi-conducting range 2.9 x 10(-4) S cm(-1) - 6.8 x 10(-6) S cm(-1) which happened to be higher than the conductivity values of the reported composites of poly(urethane)/polypyrrole. The semi-IPN formation was further investigated by FT-IR, thermal, and SEM analysis.

TI A generic analytical model for micro-diaphragm pumps with active valves
SO JOURNAL OF MICROMECHANICS AND MICROENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
ID DESIGN
AB We present a fully analytical model for micro-diaphragm pumps with active valves, based on the peristaltic working principle. Our model is suited for very fast as well as for very slow actuation mechanisms. Therefore it can be applied to a variety of actuation principles, e.g. piezoelectric, pneumatic, thermo-pneumatic or pre-stressed shape memory actuation. We show that the dynamics of this kind of micropump can be fully described by a lumped element approach taking only the mechanical behaviour of the diaphragms and the viscous losses at the valves into account. The full flow versus frequency and backpressure characteristic is derived. Our model is capable of predicting the maximum achievable flow rate and the maximum sustainable backpressure of micro-diaphragm pumps with active valves. Different modes of operation, which are distinguished by the speed of the actuation mechanism, the pressure history inside the pump and the applied driving scheme, are identified. We show that micro-diaphragm pumps with active valves generally suffer from a linear dependence of the flow rate on the applied backpressure. This fact, which is already known from micropumps with passive valves, is remarkable, because it is in contradiction to the characteristics of macroscopic peristaltic pumps. A set of design rules for the dimensioning of the valves in dependence on the actuation force and the desired hydrodynamic characteristics (maximum flow rate and maximum sustainable backpressure) are derived. Our theoretical results are proven by experimental results of our piezoelectrically actuated micropump. A maximum flow rate of 1.4 ml min(-1) and a maximum sustainable backpressure of 40 kPa were achieved.

AB In 2003, India had over 5.1 million infected individuals living with HIV/AIDS. The percentage of all HIV cases attributed to perinatal transmission has been increasing steadily from 0.33% of total cases in 1999 to 2.80% in 2004. Recent statistics indicate that over 130,000 infants have been infected through this route. Despite recent advances in reducing in utero and interpartum transmission with the use of antiretrovirals, there is a critical need to make infant feeding safer. Current UNAIDS/WHO/UNICEF recommendations stress avoidance of all breast-feeding if replacement feeding fulfills the key requirements of being affordable, feasible, acceptable, sustainable, and safe. In this paper, we examine how the UNAIDS/WHO/UNICEF recommendations have been actualized within the context of an urban government hospital in India. The documented patterns of infant feeding by HIV-positive mothers in Pune, India, from 2000 to 2004, highlight the complexities of making an informed and healthy choice under suboptimal conditions. The data indicate that interpersonal variations in the key requirements greatly influence the optimal practice to minimize mortality risks. Moreover, local information on health outcomes is crucial to tailoring policy recommendations to save lives. We propose the development of a decision-making algorithm that includes factors affecting mother-to-infant transmission, including site-specific data on health risks to the mother and the child. Such an algorithm would allow identification of the healthiest feeding choice and would minimize the pitfalls of promoting homogeneous practices lacking site-specific evidence-based evaluation.

AB With the emphasis on sustainable agriculture, attention has been increasingly turning to recycling of crop residues as a component of fertility management strategies for tropical soils. We assessed the effects of soybean residue (SR) and wheat residue (WR) applied either alone or in combination with fertilizer P (FP) on dynamics of labile P, distribution of P fractions, and P sorption in a semiarid tropical Alfisol by conducting a 16 w long incubation experiment. The amount of P added through crop residues, FP or their combinations was kept constant at 10 mg P (kg soil)(-1). Addition of SR or WR resulted in net increase of labile inorganic (P) and organic P (P.) and microbial P throughout the incubation period, except that the WR decreased labile P-i during first 2 w due to P, immobilization. The P immobilization associated with WR addition was, however, offset when fertilizer P was combined with WR. Generally, the increases in labile-P fractions were larger with the SR and SR+FP than with the WR and WR+FP. The sequential fractionation of soil P at the end of 16 w indicated that a major part of added fertilizer P transformed into moderately labile and stable P fractions as evident from the increased NaOH-Pi and HCl-P in the FP treatment. In contrast, the addition of SR and WR alone or in combination with FP favored a build-up in NaHCO3-P-i and -P-o and NaOH-P-o fractions while causing a decrease in NaOH-P-i and HCl-P fractions. The addition of these crop residues also effectively decreased the P-sorption capacity and hence reduced the standard P requirement of the soil (i.e., the amount of P required to maintain optimum solution P concentration of 0.2 mg P l(-1)) by 24%-43%. Results of the study, thus, imply that soybean and wheat crop residues have the potential to improve P fertility of Alfisols by decreasing P-sorption capacity and by redistributing soil P in favor of labile-P fractions and promoting accretion of organic P.

AB Increased environmental awareness and interest in long-term sustainability of material resources has motivated considerable advancements in composite materials made from natural fibers and resins, or biocomposites. In spite of these developments the lower stiffness and strength of biocomposites has limited their applications to non-load-bearing components. This paper presents an overview of a study aimed at showing that the shortcomings of biocomposites can be overcome through hybrid material designs and efficient structural con. gurations to make them suitable for load bearing structural components. Hybrid blends of natural and synthetic fibers can significantly improve the characteristics of biocomposites with minimal cost and environmental impact, and hierarchical cellular designs can maximize material efficiency in structural components. Periodic and hierarchical cellular plate designs made from natural fibers and unsaturated polyester resin were evaluated experimentally and analytically. Stiffness, strength, and dimensional stability of all-biocomposite and hybrid natural-synthetic material systems were evaluated through material tests while structural performance of cellular plate designs was assessed through flexural tests on laboratory- scale samples. The experimental results were correlated with analytical models for short-fiber composites and cellular structures. The results showed that biocomposites have adequate short-term performance and that they can efficiently compete with housing panels made from conventional structural materials.

ID PROVISION
AB This paper explores the provision of homes for less wealthy households in rural England. By allowing 'exceptions' to UK planning law to provide low-income housing for local residents, the national government seeks to secure dwellings for the less wealthy and so sustain socially mixed rural villages. This paper explores how the production of homes through the exception policy is not conducive to the construction of many new houses. The particular emphasis in the paper is on how responsible agents are discouraged from being more active in erecting new village homes for low-income households. Empirically, the paper draws on documents, interviews and a social survey in the counties of Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Norfolk to investigate the process of delivering rural exception homes. It is concluded that, despite Government assertions that a socially mixed countryside is desirable, the decision-making criteria that dominate the worldviews of agents in social housing provision work against this outcome.

   human-livestock relations in Northeast Scotland

   AGRICULTURE; ANIMALS; BREEDS
AB The Curry Report (Policy Commission on the Future of Farming and Food, Farming and Food: A Sustainable Future (Curry Report), Cabinet Office, London, 2002) recently recommended that farmers 'reconnect' with their consumers, their markets and the food chain. In terms of livestock production this process of reconnection may not be so straightforward, firstly, because of the productive paradoxes upon which livestock production is built, and secondly, because the nature of people's relationships with livestock is complex, ambiguous and dynamic. This paper uses ethnographic data to illustrate sociologically the paradoxical nature of commercial and hobby livestock production in the context of Northeast Scotland. Producers of livestock have contradictory productive roles: as empathetic carers and economic producers of 'sentient commodities'. The attitudes, feelings and behaviours of those working with livestock cannot be isolated from the position of both humans and animals in the division of labour (breeding, storing and finishing) and the socio-economic context in which commercial and hobby livestock production occurs. For example, those working with breeding animals tend to express varying degrees of emotional attachment whilst those preparing livestock for slaughter express varying degrees of emotional detachment. Any animal, however, that deviates from the routine process of production can stand out from the herd, become individually recognised, have more meaning to the worker, and thus become more than 'just an animal'. I will also draw on the work of Merton (Sociological Ambivalence and Other Essays, The Free Press, New York, 1976), Digard (Relationships between humans and domesticated animals, Interdisciplinary Science Reviews 19(3) (1994) 231) and Kopytoff (The cultural biography of things: commoditisation as process, In: A. Appadurai (Ed.), The Social Life of Things: Commodities in Cultural Perspective, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1986, pp. 64-91) to provide an emerging framework to understand the variable characteristics of people's relationships with their animals, and to account for and capture their contradictory and unstable elements.

TI A resource-utilization model of organizational efficiency in
   professional sports teams
SO JOURNAL OF SPORT MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID SUSTAINABLE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; MANAGERIAL EFFICIENCY; VIEW; BASEBALL
AB The resource-based view explains sustainable competitive advantage as the consequence of an organization's endowment of unique and imperfectly replicable resources. Superior organizational performance, however, depends not only on the organization's resource endowment but also on the efficiency with which the resource endowment is used. In this article a resource-utilization model of a professional sports team is developed in which teams optimize the stock of athletic resources (i.e., playing talent), subject to ownership preferences, over sporting and financial performance. The resource-utilization model is used to analyze the factors influencing the team's current endowment of athletic resources and evaluate the efficiency with which teams utilize both their athletic and allegiance (i.e., fan base) resources to achieve sporting and financial targets. Empirical evidence is presented on the sporting and financial performance of English professional soccer teams in the FA Premier League over the period 1998-2002. It was found that the financial performance of teams is significantly affected by their ownership status.

SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION

   pool resources; cooperative solutions; Honduras
AB Access to clean and sufficient amounts of water is a critical problem in many countries. A watershed approach is vital in understanding pollution pathways affecting water resources and in developing participatory solutions. Such integration of information with participatory approaches can lead to more sustainable solutions than traditional "crisis-to-crisis" management approaches. This study aims at applying a watershed based joint action approach to manage water resources. Since most watersheds have urban and rural sources of pollution and a wide disparity in access to and use of water, alternative solutions need to take an integrated approach through cooperative actions. An institutional model was applied to seven subwatersheds in Honduras to evaluate various sources and effects of water contamination and water shortages. Two specific pathways of water resources degradation were studied (contamination from coffee pulp manufacturing and urban nonpoint sources) to develop alternative solutions that mitigate downstream impacts of access to clean water. A locally driven joint mechanism to reuse coffee pulp in farming systems is proposed. Such an institutional solution can maximize benefits to both farms and the coffee pulp industry. A combination of education and investment in sanitary facilities in urbanizing areas is proposed to minimize urban sources of water contamination.

AB In response to recent severe drought conditions throughout the state, Arizona recently developed its first drought plan. The Governor's Drought Task Force focused on limiting the economic and social impacts of future droughts through enhanced adaptation and mitigation efforts. The plan was designed to maximize the use of new, scientific breakthroughs in climate monitoring and prediction and in vulnerability assessment. The long term objective of the monitoring system is to allow for evaluation of conditions in multiple sectors and at multiple scales. Stakeholder engagement and decision support are key objectives in reducing Arizona's vulnerability in light of the potential for severe, sustained drought. The drivers of drought conditions in Arizona include the El Nino-Southem Oscillation, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation.

TI Charcoal potential of Miombo woodlands at Kitulangalo, Tanzania
SO JOURNAL OF TROPICAL FOREST SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
DE renewable energy; growth; management
AB A study was carried out to determine the charcoal potential of the miombo woodlands of Kitulangalo area, near Morogoro, Tanzania. Systematic sampling design used in an inventory in 1996 was repeated in 1999 in order to determine the general current stand parameters and forest change. A total of 46 sample plots were laid out in the forest reserve. In adjacent public lands stratified random sampling was applied where a total of 30 plots were laid out. The layout was meant to study how species richness and wood stocking vary in public lands and forest reserve. Preferred tree species for charcoal making had standing wood volume of 24.5 m(3)ha(-1) and 56.5 m(3)ha(-1) in public lands and reserved forest respectively with corresponding basal area of 3.7 m(2)ha(-1) and 7.2 m(2)ha(-1). Stem numbers were 909 stems ha(-1) in public lands and 354 stems ha(-1) in the reserved forest. These values indicated more regeneration in public lands following disturbance than in the forest reserve. The weight of charcoal that can be extracted from the woodland at the roadside was 56 kg, equivalent to only one bag of charcoal per hectare. Similarly 54 bags may be extracted at 5 km distance while 125 bags may be extracted from beyond 10 km from the highway. With the established stand growth rate of 2.3 m(3)ha(-1)year(-1) for the regrowth of miombo woodland at Kitulangalo, it will take about 8 to 15 years for the degraded woodlands to recover for charcoal production. Therefore, for sustainable charcoal production in this area, felling cycles of 8 to 15 years are recommended, provided the minimum tree size of > 10 cm dbh (diameter at breast height) for charcoal making is observed.

TI Non-timber forest products in the western Ghats of India: Floristic
   attributes, extraction and regeneration
SO JOURNAL OF TROPICAL FOREST SCIENCE

DE biodiversity; indigenous knowledge; regeneration; species loss
ID VEGETATION
AB An attempt was made to examine the occurrence, regeneration and extraction patterns of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) at three locations in the Western Ghats of Peninsular India. NTFP-yielding plants in the Western Ghats constituted about 40% of the flora. However, only less than 50% of the 229 NTFP species were commercially exploited. The rest were used by local people. Species richness was variable between sites but reflected disturbance regimes and/or the magnitude of NTFP extraction. During NTFP collection, often branches are lopped for harvesting fruits, fires are lit at the base of trees to stimulate resin flow and the bark is collected in a destructive manner. High extraction rates of some NTFPs resulted in poor density, sparse distribution of species and depletion of biodiversity. Yet herbaceous NTFP species, capable of regenerating through vegetative means, registered adequate regeneration, even when 95% of the plants were harvested. An understanding of the vital attributes of the NTFP species is, therefore, critical for sustainable NTFP management.

DT Article

ID SOIL-EROSION; WATER
AB Two related land use change dynamics characterise the Guadalentin basin (southeast Spain) as one of the most severe cases of desertification in Europe: (1) expansion of highly productive irrigated agriculture in the valley, and (2) intense contemporary changes in the surrounding impoverished dry lands. On the basis of documented information, we trace the effects of past policies on these dynamics, illustrating such role with the results of 25 in-depth interviews on the issue with relevant stakeholders in the area. In line with relevant related research in other parts of the Mediterranean, our conclusion is that implemented policies have overemphasised the economic dimensions of development at the expense of environmental sustainability, specifically targeted policy instruments having failed to address the issue of desertification. Given this experience, it is estimated that only strict environmental policy enforcement together with people education could bring the situation under control. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The concepts of integrated and sustainable management have been discussed in detail in resource management literature, but there has been less attention to practical ways to implement and evaluate the success of these concepts at the local level. Use of a normative model, based on key principles, evaluative questions and benchmark criteria, provides a practical and adaptable too] for the implementation and evaluation of integrated and sustainable management. This paper illustrates a method by which land use planning and water management activities may be evaluated through the development of a normative model, and discusses lessons learned from an application of the model to three study municipalities in the Province of Ontario, Canada.

TI Towards sustainable flood and coastal management: identifying drivers

DE managed realignment; flood and coastal defence; climate change;
   stakeholder consultation
ID CO-EVOLUTIONARY APPROACH; CHANGE IMPACT ASSESSMENT; DEFENSE; UK
AB Managed realignment-the deliberate process of realigning river, estuary or coastal defences-is increasingly seen as a key element to sustainable long term flood and coastal management in the UK and other parts of the world, given current trends of sea level rise, and increasing costs of flood and coastal defence. This paper presents results of an extensive consultation of key stakeholders in England and Wales on what they consider to be the main drivers, of and obstacles to, managed realignment. It reveals why managed realignment has not taken place on a larger scale so far, and suggests new directions for a long-term strategic approach to river and coastal flood management.

TI Improving the rural data infrastructure of Scotland: an overview
SO LAND USE POLICY
LA English
DT Article
DE rural development; rural policy; data infrastructure; Scotland
AB Between 1945 and 1992 rural development policy in the UK was characterised by its sectoral approach, with agriculture dominating. Since then, reforms to the Common Agricultural Policy, and the UK government's commitment to sustainable development, have signalled a policy shift towards integrated rural development. Implementation is partly constrained by an institutional framework that evolved to set, deliver and evaluate sectoral policy. A particular legacy of this framework concerns the way data are gathered. This issue has been explored in a case study on the rural data infrastructure of Scotland. The findings highlight: the currently low level of user awareness of data sources; the lack of central government engagement in and individual awareness of related UK data infrastructure initiatives; and the current focus on top-down data provision being a constraint on community-led development. The commentary explores the interplay between policy and technology drivers and we argue that, whilst data sharing has been assumed to be a technical problem, there is evidence to suggest that it is more a social one concerning power relationships both within and between institutions. This is discussed in relation to other infrastructure projects in Europe and North America. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The objectives of Scottish rural development policy are moving towards economic, social and environmental sustainability, promoted through local community empowerment. The new challenges raised and future data needs were considered using three scenarios. Workshop discussions was held with participants from all levels of rural development. The possible re-orientation of data availability and provision were investigated. The need for accessible and appropriate forms of data to lift current constraints on rural community empowerment and participation in local development, and to support rural communities' decision-making and strategic planning were highlighted. Issues of ownership, confidentiality, access, quality, consistency and funding were raised, alongside communities' training and education needs in information handling and interpretation. The implications for participatory rural development via community data infrastructure provision are discussed. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We study the sustainability of long-run growth in a two-sector economy where a renewable natural resource is exploited under private property rights. We obtain short-and long-run growth trajectories in closed form, examine transitional dynamics, and characterize convergence properties. We find conditions for sustainable long-run growth, which depend on the harvesting rate, and show that the speed of convergence decreases during transition. We identify a stronger version of Hartwick's rule and analyze parameter dependences for endogenous variables. Economic growth relies less on abundance or scarcity of natural resources than on the way they are managed.

AB This unique project invited community members to test sustainable techniques for restoring a weed-infested field to a native grassland community. In a cultivated Bromus inermis grassland at The Arboretum at Flagstaff, Flagstaff, Arizona, we randomly assigned 144 plots to weed removal and recovery treatments. The experimental design had 12 replicate plots assigned to organic herbicide, weed barrier fabric, manual removal, or control for the weed removal factor; it had seeding, plugging, or no action for the recovery factor. College, middle and high school students, and community members collected and propagated native seed, implemented restoration treatments, collected plant community data, and learned methods for implementing restoration in their own backyards. We quantified percent cover of smooth brome, other exotics, and native species cover and richness. Although no treatment completely removed B. inermis, manual removal was the most effective treatment for significantly reducing B. inermis, while significantly increasing native species richness and cover. Weed barrier fabric followed as the second most effective method, and organic herbicide was ineffective. After three months, neither seeding nor plugging significantly affected native cover. A longer response time and irrigation may improve recovery treatment success.
   Widespread community support made this project possible. Post-activity evaluations indicated that students gained an appreciation and working knowledge of restoration. The goal to engage citizens in a project that will become a locally adapted seed resource for future restoration projects has shown promise in its first year, but will require more input before a weed-free native seed resource is realized.

AB Human activities have differentially altered biogeochemical cycling at local, regional and global scales. We propose that a stoichiometric approach, examining the fluxes of multiple elements and the ratio between them, may be a useful tool for better understanding human effects on ecosystem processes and services. The different scale of impacts of the elements carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus and the different nature of their biogeochemical cycles, imply a large variation of their stoichiometric ratios in space and time and thus divergent impacts on biota.
   In this paper, we examine the effects of anthropogenic perturbations on nutrient ratios in ecosystems in two examples and one case study. Altered stoichiometry in agricultural systems (example 1) can affect not only crop yield and quality but also the interactions between plants and their pollinators, pests and pathogens. Human activities have also altered stoichiometry in coastal ecosystems (example 2). Increased N loading has especially lead to increased N: P and reduced Si: N ratios, with detrimental effects on ecosystem services derived from coastal pelagic food webs, such as fish yield and water quality. The terrestrial-aquatic linkage in stoichiometric alterations is illustrated with a case study, the Mississippi River watershed, where anthropogenic activities have caused stoichiometric changes that have propagated through the watershed into the northern Gulf of Mexico.
   Coupled with altered stoichiometric nutrient inputs are the inherent differences in variation and sensitivity of different ecosystems to anthropogenic disturbance. Furthermore, the connections among the components of a watershed may result in downstream cascades of disrupted functioning. Applying a multiple element perspective to understanding and addressing societal needs is a new direction for both ecological stoichiometry and sustainability.

AB Background/aims: The fight against blinding trachoma is being addressed with an integrated strategy of surgery, antibiotics, hygiene promotion, and environmental improvement-the SAFE strategy, but its cost-effectiveness is largely unknown. This paper estimates the cost effectiveness of surgery and antibiotics in trachoma-endemic areas in seven world regions. Methods: A population model was applied to follow the lifelong impact on individuals receiving trachoma control. Intervention costs and effectiveness estimates were based on a combination of primary data collection and literature review. Results: Providing trichiasis surgery to 80% of those who need it would avert over 11 million DALYs per year globally, with cost effectiveness ranging from I$13 to I$78 per DALY averted across regions. Mass antibiotic treatment of all children using azythromycin at prevailing market prices would avert more than 4 million DALYs per year globally with cost-effectiveness ranging between I$9,000 and I$65,000 per DALY averted. The intervention is only cost-effective if azythromycin is donated or becomes available at reduced prices. Mass treatment of all children with tetracycline and targeted treatment with azythromycin are not cost-effective. Conclusions: As individual components of the SAFE strategy, trichiasis surgery for trachoma is a cost-effective way of restoring sight in all epidemiological sub-regions considered, as is the use of azythromycin, if donated or at reduced prices. Large study uncertainties do not change study conclusions. The results should be interpreted in the context of the overall SAFE strategy to address issues of sustainability.

AB All readings take place in the here-and-now, even of texts written back there and then. Nowhere in management and organization theory has this been truer of anyone than Max Weber. Unread in English during his lifetime, it was nearly 30 years after his death before his ideas had much impact. When they did, they were read in a context and tradition years away from those in which they were conceived. And, ever since, they have been subject to systematic reinterpretation on the one hand and neglect on the other. The paper addresses how one might use Weber today, in terms of his sensitivity to current issues, such as sustainability, as well as the still largely unacknowledged foundation that Weber constructed for contemporary cultural studies. The paper will bring these two themes together, using analysis of contemporary equivalents to the popular culture that formed the basis for some of Weber's own investigations.

AB The Guianas contain one of the largest single remaining tracts of undisturbed tropical rainforest in the world, but this forest and its fauna are facing increased threats. In the north of French Guiana both anthropogenic pressures and conflicts between settlements related to the use of natural resources are growing. Based on surveys in 17 forest sites we show that hunting pressure was the main factor determining current primate species richness, masking the effects of logging or forest type. Three of the larger species, the red howler monkey Alotialta smicitilits, black spider monkey Ateles pain. and tufted capuchin Cebus apella, were less abundant in hunted areas. In the areas around four settlements the harvested biomass of primates was low compared to other game species, but the harvests were close to or beyond the maximal sustainable thresholds for the red howler monkey and tufted capuchin. In French Guiana primates are either fully protected by law (the spider monkey and white-faced saki Pithecia pithecia), or their hunting is restricted to subsistence use (howler monkey, tufted capuchin and wedge-capped capuchin Cebus olivaceus). Most hunted meat is, however, destined for sale. Current conservation policy in French Guiana is limited to legal protection for some species and areas, and laws are poorly enforced. Although large areas of forest and its wildlife are protected simply by their remoteness, there is an increasingly urgent need for the legal protection of all primate species, and the establishment of large protected areas and efficient forest management schemes to minimize the impacts of logging and hunting.

AB In the Cook Islands the population of Pteropus tonganus tonganus is thought to be declining, but a lack of knowledge of its status, feeding and roosting requirements has precluded effective conservation plans. We surveyed P. t. tonganus on the Cook Islands through observations, counts and interviews with local residents. We estimated the population to be c. 1,730 on Rarotonga and 78 on Mangaia. A lack of suitable habitat on Mangaia was the most important factor affecting abundance. Overhunting appears to have reduced the populations on both islands. All roost sites were found in undisturbed forest on steep slopes and ridges in the inner and most inaccessible parts of the islands, with roost preference determined by the relative safety from humans rather than food availability. The residents of the Cook Islands seem generally unaware of the serious threat the bats face, with little thought for sustainable hunting. For successful conservation it will be important to alter people's negative perception of these mammals, promoting the value of the bats both ecologically and as a potential source of income from tourists. Habitat protection and enhancement, particularly on Mangaia, will be essential.

AB An endogenous growth model, which links pollution to ineffective input-use, is developed to examine the potential for achieving balanced growth while preserving the environment through investment in conservation capital. We derive conditions under which individual preferences for environmental quality and private incentives for investment in conservation capital can lead to non-decreasing environmental quality with balanced growth even in the absence of environmental regulations. Additionally, conditions under which investment in conservation capital can enable an environmentally regulated economy to achieve a higher rate of sustainable balanced growth than otherwise are analysed.

SO PACIFIC SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB The acronym PABITRA stands for Pacific-Asia Biodiversity Transect, a network of island sites and conservation professionals collaborating throughout the Pacific-Asia region. An ideal PABITRA site is a broad landscape transect from sea to summit. Such a landscape is Kahana Valley on Windward O'ahu. Kahana Valley served during prior centuries as an ahupua'a, a Polynesian unit of land management that integrated the three biological resource zones, the upland forests, the agriculturally used land below, and the coastal zone, into a sustainable human support system. Results of terrestrial biodiversity surveys, as begun with a vegetation /environment study and a paleoecological investigation, are presented in relation to historical land use and sea level changes. In spite of the many former human-induced modifications of the Kahana Valley landscape, the natural structure and function of its ecosystems arc well preserved. The distribution patterns of vegetation can be interpreted in terms of Hawaiian ecological zones in combination with the valley's precipitation, topography, stream system, and archaeological features. Currently, efforts are under way to restore the Kahana State Park (recently renamed Ahupua'a 'O Kahana State Park) as a functional ahupua'a. In addition, focused collaborative research can yield helpful information for further restoration and integrated management of the Kahana ahupua'a as a historic Hawaiian Heritage Site.

AB While non-point pollution from agriculture has become an increasingly serious problem in China, some progress has been made in studying the causal biophysical processes. However, few studies have assessed the economic consequences of non-point pollution in China or the policy options that could be employed to combat it. In this work a sustainable strategy to control non-point pollution from crop production, which involved taxing excessive inputs of irrigation water and fertilizer, was proposed. The approach taken to assess these measures combined biophysical and economic models, having a trade-off between economic returns and an improved environment. A proven and practical spatially referenced water and nutrient management model was used to determine the quantities of excessive irrigation water and fertilizer for specific soil and land use. Also, a set of indicators were proposed for evaluating the effects of agricultural economic output and agricultural practices on the environment.

AB Long-term fertility experiments have become an important tool for investigating the sustainability of cropping systems. Therefore, a long-term (18-year) fertilization experiment was conducted in Changwu County, Shaanxi Province, China, to ascertain the effect of the long-term application of chemical fertilizers and manure on wheat yield and soil fertility in the Loess Plateau, so as to provide a scientific basis for sustainable land management. The experiment consisted of nine fertilizer treatments with three replicates arranged in a completely randomized design: 1) CK (no fertilizer); 2) N (N 120 kg ha(-1)); 3) P (P 26.2 kg ha(-1)); 4) NP (N 120, P 26.2 kg ha(-1)); 5) M (manure 75 t ha(-1)); 6) NM (N 120 kg ha(-1), manure 75 t ha(-1)); 7) PM (P 26.2 kg ha(-1), manure 75 t ha(-1)); 8) NPM (N 120, P 26.2 kg ha(-1), manure 75 t ha(-1)); and 9) fallow (no fertilizer, no crop). N fertilizer was applied in the form of urea and P was applied as calcium super phosphate. The results showed that precipitation had a large effect on the response of wheat yield to fertilization. Manure (M), NP, PM, NM, and NPM treatments significantly increased (P < 0.05) average yield. In the NP, PM, NM and NPM treatments, the percentage increases in yield due to fertilization were highest in normal years, and lowest in the drought years. Long-term P application enhanced soil available P markedly, and manure applications contributed more to soil fertility than chemical fertilizers alone. Chemical fertilizers applied together with manure distinctly improved soil fertility. The results also showed that the soil nutrient concentration changed mainly in the 0-60 cm layers and fertilization and planting only slightly affected soil nutrients below the 100 cm layers.

AB Agricultural sustainability relates directly to maintaining or enhancing soil quality. Soil quality studies in Canada during the 1980's showed that loss of soil organic matter (SOM) and soil aggregate stability was standard features of non-sustainable land management in agroecosystems. In this study total soil organic carbon (SOC), particulate organic matter (POM), POM-C as a percentage of total SOC, and aggregate stability were determined for three cultivated fields and three adjacent grassland fields to assess the impact of conventional agricultural management on soil quality. POM was investigated using solid-state C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to determine any qualitative differences that may be attributed to cultivation. Results show a highly significant loss in total SOC, POM and aggregate stability in the cultivated fields as compared to the grassland fields and a significant loss of POM-C as a percentage of total SOC. Integrated results of the NMR spectra of the POM show a loss in carbohydrate-C and an increase in aromatic-C in the cultivated fields, which translates to a loss of biological lability in the organic matter. Conventional cultivation decreased the quantity and quality of SOM and caused a loss in aggregate stability resulting in an overall decline in soil quality.

AB Arbuscular mycorrhizae are the plant symbiosis the most widely spread on the planet. These fungi, grouped in the phylum Glomeromycota, are distributed over all terrestrial ecosystems and found associated with the majority of land plants. To the well-known positive impacts of arbuscular mycorrhizae on plant yields should be added several other benefits such as a better survival rate of colonized plants, the maintenance of plant biodiversity, the improvement of soil microflora, and the reduction in harmful effects of both biotic and abiotic environmental stresses. Given such a panoply of benefits to plants and their environment, one could believe that mycorrhizae represent a panacea for solving problems related to plant production and plant protection. In fact, the "plant - mycorrhizae - pathogen - environment" complex constitutes a standard condition to be maintained or to be recovered in order to ensure the sustainability of the environment. The potential of mycorrhizae as a biocontrol agent globally covers five known mechanisms of interaction. Three of them concern the direct effect of symbiosis on plants. They are: 1) plant growth stimulation through an increased nutritive contribution and, consequently, better plant health; 2) the morphological transformation of the root system; and 3) the induction or suppression of defense mechanisms, and this mainly at the enzymatic level. Another mechanism concerns the pathogen: 4) through a direct competition with mycorrhizal fungi linked with nutrient availability and infection sites. Finally, mycorrhizae indirectly influence the soil structure and quality through: 5) the modification of the soil microflora and an increase in organic matter.

AB Circadian rhythms are self-sustaining oscillations whose period length under constant conditions is about 24 h. Circadian rhythms are widespread and involve functions as diverse as human sleep-wake cycles and cyanobacterial nitrogen fixation. In spite of a long research history, knowledge about clock-controlled genes is limited in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Using a cDNA macroarray containing 10 368 nuclear-encoded genes, we examined global circadian regulation of transcription in Chlamydomonas. We identified 269 candidates for circadianly expressed gene. Northern blot analysis confirmed reproducible and sustainable rhythmicity for 12 genes. Most genes exhibited peak expression at the transition point between day and night. One hundred and eighteen genes were assigned predicted annotations. The functions of the cycling genes were diverse and included photosynthesis, respiration, cellular structure, and various metabolic pathways. Surprisingly, 18 genes encoding chloroplast ribosomal proteins showed a coordinated circadian pattern of expression and peaked just at the beginning of subjective day. The co-regulation of genes bearing a similar function was also observed in genes involved in cellular structure. They peaked at the end of the subjective night, which is when the regeneration of cell walls and flagella in daughter cells occurs. Expression of the chlamyopsin gene, which encodes an opsin-type photoreceptor, also exhibited circadian rhythm.

AB A new stage of environmental policy making in local government has emerged as managerial reforms to improve the performance of local government in England seek to secure sustainability alongside more traditional measures such as economy, efficiency and effectiveness. In this article we present the first empirical test of the relationship between environmental sustainability and managerial reform, using the example of Best Value. Data are drawn from a large survey of 706 officers in 102 English local authorities. Statistical results suggest that sustainability, inspired by managerial reform, is assisted by favourable environmental attitudes and the presence of strong corporate values but is frustrated by poor integration and departmental cultures towards sustainability. An agenda of further research is offered in conclusion.

AB An ecological system often requires moderate, and sometimes even generous interactions among constituents for achieving a sustainable coexistence. Here we propose a configuration individual-based model for demonstrating the evolution of generosity in an evolutionary demand game. In the game, two players, proposers and responders, simultaneously make their demands. If the sum of demands is no more than the total amount of the available resource at each game, each player obtains its own demand. However, both players get nothing if the sum exceeds the total amount. We incorporated generosity by discounting players' demands. In every generation, random pairs were formed, and each pair played the demand game. For the next generation, individuals left a number of offspring proportional to their total payoff. Demand and generosity levels of an individual were inherited by its offspring with slight modification by a small random mutation. When only proposers were allowed to discount their demands, distribution of generosity levels had its mode at zero, and hence generosity did not evolve. However, when both proposers and receivers were allowed to discount their demands, the mean generosity level rose from zero. The resultant populations were not homogeneous, but were made of heterogeneous individuals with high and low generosity levels. Mean demand and generosity levels fluctuated greatly because of the neutral selection for the demand and generosity combinations that equally maximized the payoff of the demand game. Spatially limited interaction increased generosity levels even if only proposers discounted their demands.

ID PREVENTION; EDUCATION; MODEL; CARE
AB Schools are increasingly recognized as a critical venue for the provision of comprehensive behavioral and mental health services for students. Unfortunately, difficulties associated with operating programs in schools often prevent evidence-based practices from being implemented and sustained as intended. In this study, the experiences of school and community providers who were funded through the Safe Schools/Healthy Students Initiative to implement mental health services in a large, urban school district were investigated using a qualitative focus group methodology. Providers identified the major challenges they encountered with implementing, operating, and sustaining their programs as well as the strategies that they used to overcome those challenges. Strategies to enhance support of school-based mental health programs are discussed. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Background. The United Nation's Children Fund (UNICEF) has indicated that urban poverty is primarily found in squatter settlements. At present, 13.5% of all. South African households live in informal settlements. The main hypothesis for this empirical study was that micromechanisms would not negatively influence food, nutrition and health of residents in an informal settlement in the Vaal Triangle, South Africa. This hypothesis was tested empirically against the UNICEF framework of the immediate, underlying and basic causes of malnutrition. The purpose of this study was to establish a situation analysis of children and women before designing any intervention.
   Objectives. The objectives covered in this paper include Phases I and 11 of the project, namely planning of the project and determining the demographic and health profile of the sample as part of a situation analysis.
   Study design. This is a community participatory project. After a strategic participatory planning workshop with stakeholders, a plan of operation document, guiding all. field undertakings, was drawn up (Phase I), followed by a cross-sectional baseline survey (Phase II), situation analysis (Phase III), and implementation of community-based intervention studies (Phase IV). Impact measurement will follow in Phase V.
   Methods. After the planning meeting and obtaining consent, a pretested, structured demographic and health questionnaire was used to obtain data from 357 randomly selected households in an informal settlement. Data were statistically analysed for means and standard deviations.
   Results. The findings of the workshop evaluation indicated that 100% of the participants (n = 34) agreed that a need existed for this project, 74% (n = 24) understood the relevance, and 64% (n = 22) realized the importance for sustainable community development. In the baseline survey, 89% of the respondents lived in zinc shacks with two rooms or less (32.2%), three or four rooms (41.5%) or four rooms or more (26.3%). The household size was six people or more (33%), five people (18.5%), four people (21.3%) and three people or less (27.2%). The unemployment rate was 94.2% for respondents and 80.1% for their partners. The majority of households (42.6%) had a monthly income of < R500 (US$71). The major health problems observed were chronic coughing (42%) and headaches (50.4%). Death of a child under 5 years of age was reported by 27.7% of respondents, of which 34.8% were stillborn, over the previous 5 years.
   Conclusions. These findings confirmed that poverty and household food insecurity were major problems. As such, these results form the basis for planning and implementing sustainable community-based intervention projects to promote public health nutrition in the Vaal Triangle, South Africa. It is, however, important to ensure community participation during all phases of the project to ensure sustainabitity. (c) 2004 The Royal Institute of Public Health. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

DE eco-industrial development; industrial ecology; regions; local economy
AB Increasingly, concepts such as sustainable development and ecological modernization have entered into local and regional economic policies and strategies. However, integrating environmental and economic aims has proved difficult, despite arguments that sustainability enables solutions. Eco-industrial development is a recent policy initiative that attempts to integrate economic, social and environmental aims in I concrete form. Derived from concepts of industrial ecology, eco-industrial developments seek to increase business competitiveness, reduce waste and pollution, create jobs, and improve working conditions. While these initiatives are said to offer a new basis for local and regional development, there has been little critical evaluation of eco-industrial development.

AB There is currently a wave of interest in how social, political and economic institutions embedded within a region can encourage an improved economic performance, with their actions and interactions thought to be a key facet of competitiveness. These analytical developments have coincided with the appreciation by regional agencies that the hosting of high-profile events can bring significant economic benefits through levering additional regional demand and exposure. However, only when the evaluation of major events is undertaken within a paradigm that emphasizes the importance of complex interactions can an estimate of genuine economic contribution be made. The contribution of two major, or 'hallmark', events towards the development of sustainable regional partnerships and relationships is assessed, and the results were found to be mixed.

AB The fundamental changes in the political and economic domains in Russia in the late 1990s affected the Russian scientific community profoundly. This paper focuses on the effects on the Russian higher education system. Today about 75% of the students study in the provinces. The new multi-channel funding system in Russia had a strong impact on R&D in the universities. Provincial universities are becoming a key source of new knowledge and skills. This paper discusses the factors influencing research activity in the different geographical regions and looks at intraand international collaboration and at access to information and communication technology as important factors for sustainability in the Russian regions.

DE household recycling behaviour; attitudes; small waste electrical and
   electronic equipment
ID COLLECTION; WASTE; ENGLAND; UK
AB Waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) is recognised as the fastest growing waste stream in the European Union (EU), with estimates of up to 20 kg per person per annum. A wide variety of WEEE is discarded by consumers, often in different ways depending on size with small items (e.g. toasters) being easier to dispose of than larger ones (e.g. washing machines). Currently, small WEEE is not treated as a priority waste stream in the UK as in order to meet targets under the WEEE Directive 2 (CEC, 2003c) it makes more sense to focus on larger items for which collection, reuse and recycling systems already exist, but small items need to be tackled for a number of reasons, including the long term strategic development of infrastructure. In light of this, the paper will assess consumer attitudes towards the disposal of small WEEE, and identify key problems raised by the implementation of the WEEE Directive in relation to these small product groups. The findings from a large scale postal questionnaire, and semi-structured interviews conducted in Cardiff, Wales will be used, and key literature and research carried out to date on the disposal of WEEE, and household attitudes to waste and recycling will be assessed. It will also look at how the implementation of the WEEE Directive 'fits in' with the current transition in the UK towards more sustainable waste management practices at the household level, and then explore the most effective ways of engaging householders in the recycling of small WEEE. Key recommendations will then be outlined concerning the future strategic development and practical implementation of the WEEE Directive in relation to consumer involvement and small product types.

LA English
DT Article
DE landfill research; EC waste policy; legislative changes; scientific
   papers; popular papers; Finland
AB Legislative changes have greatly altered waste management in Finland. The adoption of the EC waste policies in particular has created a pressure to dispose less waste on landfills and increase the sustainable use and recycling of natural resources. Implementation of new policies has created a need to improve the existing landfilling practices and recycling on landfills, and to increase the knowledge about landfills in general. This is likely to have affected the course of landfill-related research in Finland. In this study, we investigate the development of Finnish landfill research by studying the trends in the number and the focus of publications on landfill research. The impacts of legislative changes and EC policies on research activities were examined. Additionally, we reviewed the publication of research results within and outside of the scientific community and studied the development of public interest in landfills. We show that legislative changes have affected both the activity and themes of the Finnish landfill research. Waste management professionals in particular are now paying more attention to landfill questions in Finland. The study also shows that publication of Finnish research papers in international scientific media has increased during the recent years. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID APPROXIMATION; STABILITY
AB Recent papers have analyzed how economies with adaptive agents may converge to and escape from self-confirming equilibria. These papers have imputed to agents a particular prior about drifting coefficients. In the context of a model of monetary policy, this paper analyzes dynamics that govern both convergence and escape under a more general class of priors for the government. We characterize how the shape of the prior influences possible cycles, convergence, and escapes. There are priors for which the E-stability condition is not enough to assure local convergence to a self-confirming equilibrium. Our analysis also isolates the source of differences in the sustainability of Ramsey inflation encountered in the analyses of Sims [Revista de Analisis Economico 3 (1988) 3] and Chung [PhD Thesis, University of Minnesota, 1990], on the one hand, and Cho, Williams, and Sargent [Rev.

ID HEMORRHAGIC-FEVER; OUTBREAK
AB Dengue, a viral disease transmitted by mosquitoes, is endemic and frequently epidemic in many tropical countries. Because low-incidence periods vary in length, it is difficult to know in advance when an epidemic will occur. Response efforts, despite being logical, have been counter-productive at times. Furthermore, experience has demonstrated that dengue epidemics last a long time, making it important that government control efforts be sustainable while they last. This article describes priority activities requiring attention in order to minimize the impact of dengue epidemics. Such activities, which in many cases can be adapted to combat other types of epidemics as well, are as follows: (1) establishment Of an inter-sectoral action committee, (2) formalization of an emergency action plan, (3) epidemiologic surveillance, (4) diagnostic laboratory testing, (5) mosquito control, (6) protection of sources of employment and special populations, (7) patient care, (8) education of medical personnel, (9) research, and (10) transparency before the mass media. The best way to reduce the ravaging effects of dengue epidemics is to anticipate their emergence so that infection can be prevented and steps can be taken to protect the ill. Relying on improvisation to solve all the problems that arise in moments of crisis is inefficient and reckless.

   desert area; Chad
AB In order to assure rational and sustainable management of domestic livestock, haematological and serum biochemical characterisation of some local breeds of small ruminants was undertaken in Chad. Haernatocrit values greatly varied in goats : 27,5% for kirdimis, 37% for animals from Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti (BET) area, and 59,4% for sahelian goats. In the ovine species, the highest haematocrit value (47,2%) was observed in kirdimi breed (in peulh : 42,3% and in arabe sheep: 32,9%). Red blood cell counts were stable in sheep, whereas this parameter presented marked fluctuations in goats : from 4.09 in kirdimi goats to 6.88 x 10(12)/L in sahelian goats. The highest haemoglobin concentrations were recorded in sahelian goats (120.0 +/- 13.5 g/L) and in kirdimi sheep (137.0 +/- 16.1 g/L) but no particular haemoglobin type was detected by electrophoresis. Furthermore, low numbers of white blood cells asociated with moderate neutropenia and lymphopenia were noticed in goats from BET and in peulh sheep at a lesser extent. Some biochemical particularities were evidenced in sheep : strong protein concentrations in serum of arabe sheep (130.16 +/- 38.86 g/L), high glucose concentrations (1.28 +/- 0.28 g/L) and moderately enhanced lipid concentrations (2.38 +/- 0.55 g/L) in serum of kirdimis and high iron concentrations (2.60 +/- 1.10 mg/L) in peulh sheep. The sahelian goats presented markedly increased urea concentrations (0.89 +/- 0.10 g/L) in comparison to other caprine breeds. Finally, a particular biochemical profile high serum concentrations of proteins, glucose, lipids and triglycerides with very low urea concentrations (0.13 +/- 0.08 g/L) was established in goats from BET area and would result from intense mobilisation of protein and lipid stores during periods of shortage.

AB In Japan, the development and application of living modified organisms (LMOs) are regulated under the Law Concerning the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Biological Diversity. Procedures are classified as Type 1 for the use of LMOs where no preventive measures against their dispersal into the environment are required, and Type 2 for the use of LMOs with preventive measures. During the period of development, risk assessment is the responsibility of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Science, Sports and Technology. The procedures for field use of LMOs, including recombinant vaccines for veterinary use and genetically modified animals, are described in detail. Control systems for xenotransplantation of the cells, tissues and organs of transgenic pigs are yet to be established.

AB Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) vaccination is based on the administration of the gene encoding the vaccine antigen, rather than the antigen itself. Subsequent expression of the antigen by cells in the vaccinated hosts triggers the host immune system. Among the many experimental DNA vaccines tested in various animal species as well as in humans, the vaccines against rhabdovirus diseases in fish have given some of the most promising results. A single intramuscular (IM) injection of microgram amounts of DNA induces rapid and long-lasting protection in farmed salmonids against economically important viruses such as infectious haematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV) and viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV). DNA vaccines against other types of fish pathogens, however, have so far had limited success. The most efficient delivery route at present is IM injection, and suitable delivery strategies for mass vaccination of small fish have yet to be developed. In terms of safety, no adverse effects in the vaccinated fish have been observed to date. As DNA vaccination is a relatively new technology, various theoretical and long-term safety issues related to the environment and the consumer remain to be fully addressed, although inherently the risks should not be any greater than with the commercial fish vaccines that are currently used. Present classification systems lack clarity in distinguishing DNA-vaccinated animals from genetically modified organisms (GMOs), which could raise issues in terms of licensing and public acceptance of the technology. The potential benefits of DNA vaccines for farmed fish include improved animal welfare, reduced environmental impacts of aquaculture activities, increased food quality and quantity, and more sustainable production. Testing under commercial production conditions has recently been initiated in Canada and Denmark.

AB We analyzed the mortality impacts and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions produced by household energy use in Africa. Under a business-as-usual (BAU) scenario, household indoor air pollution will cause an estimated 9.8 million premature deaths by the year 2030. Gradual and rapid transitions to charcoal would delay 1.0 million and 2.8 million deaths, respectively; similar transitions to petroleum fuels would delay 1.3 million and 3.7 million deaths. Cumulative BAU GHG emissions will be 6.7 billion tons of carbon by 2050, which is 5.6% of Africa's total emissions. Large shifts to the use of fossil fuels would reduce GHG emissions by 1 to 10%. Charcoal-intensive future scenarios using current practices increase emissions by 140 to 190%; the increase can be reduced to 5 to 36% using currently available technologies for sustainable production or potentially reduced even more with investment in technological innovation.

ID ENGINEERING ETHICS; SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY
AB Environmentally Conscious Supply Chain Management (ECSCM) refers to the control exerted over all immediate and eventual environmental effects of products and processes associated with converting raw materials into final products. While much work has been done in this area, the focus has traditionally been on either: product recovery (recycling, remanufacturing, or re-use) or the product design function only (e.g., design for environment). Environmental considerations in manufacturing are often viewed as separate from traditional, value-added considerations. However, the case can be made that Professional engineers have an ethical responsibility to consider the immediate and eventual environmental impacts Of products and processes that they design and/or manage. This paper describes ECSCM as a component of engineering ethics, and highlights the major issues associated with ethical decision-making in supply chain management.

AB In an attempt to combine marine conservation and economic development, the Chilean government introduced a policy that gives formal property rights over defined areas of seabed to artisanal fishers. This study used discourse analysis to understand the impacts and consequences of this policy. Story lines based on sustainability, livelihood maintenance, and historical right claims are mechanisms by which three different groups of fishers adopted postures toward the policy and each other. These act as a means of legitimizing claims when adapting to conditions generated by the policy and also vindicate poaching between syndicates, thereby jeopardizing the whole system. Results show the fishing groups studied adopt the policy for different reasons than those espoused by government during its development. Discourse analysis assists the understanding of actors' policy responses and provides an insightful tool to investigate incentives and dominance of particular sets of ideas in a comanagement framework.

AB Research conducted in rural Alberta from 200-2001 captured women's accounts of their lives after restructuring in the health and agriculture sectors during the 1990s. Thirty-four public health nurses, home care nurses, and farm women from three Alberta health regions were interviewed individually and in focus groups which covered five Alberta health regions. The women reported that restructuring had affected their decisions, their organization of paid and unpaid work, and the quality of their lives. Rural women perceived themselves as caregivers and organizers in their homes and communities. As well, they saw themselves as key figures in the fight to save the farms and the communities in which they lived. While accepting the expectations of rural women, they also expressed frustration and anger over the endless and largely unrecognized, work that resulted. The conflicts between paid and unpaid work, and between the fight to preserve the well-being of the community and their own well-being, became particularly clear among the farm women who also worked as nurses. Their sense of themselves as farm women, nurses, and as good community members, led to decisions that in many cases affected their physical and mental health; but they knew that if they did not contribute, they risked losing the way of life they valued. While patriarchal power inherent in social structures has been well documented, we argue theoretical explanations that incorporate the power of agency to place women in situations where they have little choice in the reproduction of their own oppression have not been sufficiently recognized in the literature.

ID CARBON; SOILS
AB Chernozem soils have been recognized as one of the most important soils for food production and for the sink of organic matter on a global scale. Soil degradation or accelerated organic matter decomposition has been reported recently in northern Kazakhstan due to specific agricultural management such as summer fallow to increase the soil moisture for the cropping season. The objectives of the present study were 1) to evaluate the carbon-related properties of soil and plant in relation to the topography and amount of available water in upland fields, 2) to analyze their spatial variability using geostatistics and 3) to propose a rational system of management for the promotion of sustainable agriculture in this region. Field investigations were carried out in large-scale upland fields in Shortandy, northern Kazakhstan, where a crop rotation system had been developed on Typic Haplustolls or Southern Chernozem soils. The study field (14 km X 5 km) was divided into 70 plots (I kin X I km each) and, at the center of each plot, organic carbon (C) content (0-90 cm) and potentially mineralizable C content (0-15 cm) in soil, total, ear and shoot C contents in plant, and crop yield were investigated in addition to the elevation and soil water content at the beginning of the growing season. The total amount of C stored in soil (0-90 cm) was 170.9 t ha(-1) with the highest C content of 39.9 t ha(-1) being recorded in the surface soil (0-15 cm). Potentially mineralizable C in soil (0-15 cm) amounted to 2.72 t ha(-1), equivalent to 6.8% of the total C in the surface soil, suggesting that a considerable part of C in soil could be released as CO2 under favourable conditions for organic matter decomposition. Plant aboveground biomass C amounted to 1.8 t ha(-1), of which 1.2 t ha(-1) was returned to the field as plant residues and 0.6 t ha(-1) was removed as crop (ear). Coefficients of variation in the amount of soil mineralizable C and plant properties exceeded 40%, suggesting a considerable variation in the field. Correlation analysis indicated that the elevation showed a positive relationship with the water content, soil organic C content (P < 0.01), content of potentially mineralizable C and plant yield (p < 0.05). The spatial patterns of the measured properties in the isarithmic maps showed that the content of soil organic C was the highest in the top plateau; water content, plant C content and yield were the highest in the north-facing slope area; whereas the values of all of these parameters were relatively low in the south-facing slope area. These results strongly suggest that the organic matter dynamics in the field was considerably affected by the topography and that the most favourable area for the storage of organic matter was different from that, for food production. In conclusion, site-specific agricultural management based on the spatial patterns of organic matter dynamics would be a suitable option for harmonizing sustainable agricultural production with environmental conservation by reducing organic matter decomposition.

AB Within the scope of limited nonrenewable energy resources and the limited capacity of the ecosystem for greenhouse gases and nuclear waste, sustainability is one important target in the future. Different energy scenarios showed the huge potential for photovoltaics (PV) to solve this energy problem. Nevertheless, in the last decade, PV had an average growth rate of over 20% per year. In 2002, the solar industry delivered more than 500 MWp/year of photovoltaic generators. More than 85% of the current production involves crystalline silicon technologies. These technologies still have a high cost reduction potential, but this will be limited by the silicon feedstock. On the other hand the so-called second generation thin film solar cells based on a-Si, Cu(In,Ga)(Se,S)(2) (CIGS) or CdTe have material thicknesses of a few microns as a result of their direct band gap. Also, the possibility of circuit integration offers an additional cost reduction potential. Especially in Germany, there are a few companies who focus on thin film solar cells. Today, there are two manufacturers with production lines: the Phototronics (PST) division of RWE-Schott Solar with a-Si thin film technology and the former Antec Solar GmbH (now Antec Solar Energy GmbH) featuring the CdTe technology. A pilot line based on CIGS technology is run by Wurth Solar GmbH. There is also a variety of research activity at other companies, namely, at Shell Solar, Sulfurcell Solartechnik GmbH, Solarion GmbH and the CIS-Solartechnik GmbH. We will give an overview on research activity on various thin film technologies, as well as different manufacturing and production processes in the companies mentioned above. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB This paper reflects on varied local responses to the Kuta bombings and situates them within recent political events in Indonesia. It notes that there is an increasingly voiced need for the fuller incorporation of local realities into future development paradigms in Bali.
   Following 12 October there was a politically powerful and urgent call for Bali to get back to 'business as usual'. This opinion was presented rationally, coherently and with authority. It is, it implies, the voice of Bali. However, for many in Bali the events Of 12 October presented a critical time for reflection and seeds were evident of fledgling calls for change.
   It is suggested that for development to be sustainable in Bali there is a need to recontextualize policies and agendas in line with recent socio-political events. Crucially, there is a growing need for a change of emphasis away from a broad focus on conflicts between tourists and hosts and towards conflicts within and between localized communities.

AB Ireland's economy has undergone enormous change over the past decade, with rapid development accompanied by increasing pressures upon the natural environment. One element of this process has been the development of an 'enterprise culture' within Ireland. In this paper, we argue that Ireland is uniquely advantaged to build upon this enterprise culture, and to develop a 'sustainable enterprise culture' that is more consistent with the principles of sustainable development. Indeed, we see this as a unique opportunity to further the development of Ireland in an economically, ecologically and socially sustainable manner.

AB Assessing socio-economic and biophysical constraints on the deforestation process gains importance in the context of increasing pressure on tropical forests. In this study, we quantify forest change 'hotspots', defined as the areas where land cover changes are likely to occur in the near future, by utilizing land use/cover data, in conjunction with socio-economic and biophysical indicators, from one of the tropical forests of south India. We assessed deforestation risk as a function of density of shifting cultivation, density of agricultural area to total area, land availability for agricultural purposes, demand of endosomatic energy and the applied power to forest ecosystem. Results suggested that, due to relatively high demand for resources and high percentage of agricultural labourers, one of the provinces had high risk of forest loss. The indicators selected were useful in addressing deforestation in the study area and have potential to establish sustainable forest management models elsewhere.

AB This article explores the impact of the new sustainability agenda on the occupational and professional needs of those who have taken educational and training programmes in the environmental field either at undergraduate or postgraduate level or through relevant professional institutions' continuing professional development programmes. It also describes a one-day workshop for the professionals on sustainable development, based on systems thinking and practice. The workshop provides a model for developing greater understanding and effective action in professional practice, by using dialogue and interprofessional learning to explore approaches to sustainability in a variety of business and professional contexts. It introduces the principles underpinning the concept of sustainability and provides tools to support the integration of sustainable development into professional practice and organisational change.

ID SYSTEM
AB Critical and systemic thinking and practice can be used as a vehicle for governance to address knowledge and its implications for those who are excluded from the protection of nationality, citizenship, human rights and animal rights (by virtue of their age, their place of birth, their gender, level of education, income, ability or species). The way to achieve sustainable governance is to enable decision makers to become more mindful or more conscious of the implications of their decisions. Once it is realized that idealism and pragmatism are one, because of the 'boomerang affect' (Beck, 1992) of social and environmental injustice, greater progress towards sustainable futures can be achieved. This paper based on a manuscript argues for participatory governance that appreciates diversity to the extent that it supports sustainable social and environmental futures. It confronts terrorism, hegemony and cruelty as challenges for systemic, sustainable governance and international relations.

AB Using content analysis, this research examines the impact of the first 25 years of environmental sociology research on current introductory sociology textbooks. The investigators searched the texts for 40 key concepts in environmental sociology and for the inclusion of works by 20 award-winning environmental sociologists. On average, the texts cited 7 of the 40 key concepts. Eliminating multiple citations to a page, the total number of pages cited averaged just under three percent per book. On average, the texts cite four works by influential environmental sociologists. The texts, however, omitted some of the most central, unique concepts in the field, The texts typically treated environmental issues as social problems rather than as the by-products of institutionalized behaviors or practices. There tends to be a positive relationship between the sales of a text and the discussion of the environment.

DE Okavango Delta; enclave tourism; dependency paradigm; sustainable
   development; poverty; international and domestic tourism
AB This paper draws on the dependency paradigm to explain the development of enclave tourism and its socio-economic impacts in the Okavango Delta, Botswana. Using both primary and secondary data source, the study indicates that international tourists, foreign safari companies and investors dominate the tourism industry in the Okavango Delta. The foreign domination and ownership of tourism facilities has led to the repatriation of tourism revenue, domination of management positions by expatriates, lower salaries for citizen workers, and a general failure by tourism to significantly contribute to rural poverty alleviation in the Okavango region. Tourism as a result has a minimal economic impact on rural development mainly because it has weak linkages with the domestic economy, particularly agriculture. Because of its nature, tourism in the Okavango Delta cannot be described as being sustainable from a socio-economic perspective. In order to address problems of enclave tourism development and promote more inclusive and beneficial tourism development in the Okavango, there is need to adopt policies and strategies that will ensure that substantial amounts of tourism revenue are retained in the Okavango and Botswana. These strategies should also ensure that tourism development in the Okavango Delta has strong linkages with the rest of the economy in Botswana. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The Balearic Islands are one of the world's leading markets for sun and sand tourism. As an example of mass tourism with high environmental costs, they have been condemned by some authors as entering a final phase of decline. In this paper, the Balearic tourist market is analysed, posing three hypotheses: (1) During recent years certain characteristics of sun and sand tourism have changed, but the tourists' behaviour and needs are far removed from "new tourism" stereotypes. (2) As a sun and sand holiday destination, the Balearic Islands have undergone a considerable restructuring process directed at offering improved quality, and it is, in fact, a competitive destination. (3) The model's persistence, in the long term, must be based on the adaptation of the sun and sand tourism model within the framework of sustainable development. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper constructs a relational framework using principles of relationship marketing and the networks approach to examine the nature of exchange structure in the three case study areas-Casteton, Bakewell and Tideswell in the Peak District National Park (PDNP)-which are conceptualised as the learning regions. It examines different attitudes of actors towards partnership building and their perception of cross-sector networks. It is argued that sustainable tourism product is 'territorially embedded' in ongoing social networks and relationships. The paper illustrates how interactions amongst actors provide a context for learning. It highlights how complex web of relations provide relational capital for different actors to enable greater learning and co-operation in the future. Thus it is guided by an overall aim of investigating the implications of consciously accommodating shared concerns about local environment and collectively selling the destination.

AB The community-directed interventions (CDI) strategy achieved a desired coverage of the ultimate treatment goal (UTG) of at least 90% with ivermectin distribution for onchocerciasis control, and filled the gap between the health care services and the communities. However, it was not clear how its primary actors - the community-directed health workers (CDHW) and community-directed health supervisors (CDHS) - would perform if they were given more responsibilities for other health and development activities within their communities. A total of 429 of 636 (67.5%) of the CDHWs who were involved in other health and development activities performed better than those who were involved only in ivermectin distribution, with a drop-out rate of 2.3%. A total of 467 of 864 (54.1%) of CDHSs who were involved in other health and development activities also maintained the desired level of performance. They facilitated updating of household registers (P < 0.05), trained and supervised CDHWs, and educated community members about onchocerciasis control (P < 0.001). Their drop-out rate was 2.6%. The study showed that the majority of those who dropped out had not been selected by their community members. Therefore, CDI strategy promoted integration of health and development activities with a high potential for sustainability.

AB Following the Kyoto protocol with respect to reducing emissions of greenhouse gases emissions, and EU energy policy and sustainability in waste management, there has been an increased interest in the reduction of emissions from waste disposal operations. From the point of view of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, waste incineration and waste co-combustion are very acceptable methods for waste disposal. In order to achieve very low N2O emissions from waste incineration, particularly for waste with higher nitrogen content (e.g. sewage sludge), two factors are important: temperature of incineration over 900 degrees C and avoiding the selective non-catalytic reduction (SNCR) de-NOX method based on urea or ammonia treatments. The more modern selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems for de-NOX give rise to negligible Sources of N2O.

AB The effects on hydrological processes of the application of the landscape level measures included in the sustainable forestry initiative (SFI) program were analyzed through simulation. A landscape scenario where limitation of harvesting units' size, imposition of a green-up interval, and establishment of streamside management zones (SMZ) were simulated was compared with a reference scenario where no SFI rules were followed. An intensively managed forested landscape located in East Texas, USA, was used as the study area. The HARVEST landscape model was used to simulate landscape pattern and a modified version of the APEX model was used to simulate hydrological processes. Water and sediment yields were generally small within the observation period and most of the runoff and erosion observed occurred during intense storm events. Water and sediment yield at the subarea level and water yield at the watershed level were similar in both scenarios. However, sediment yield at the watershed level was higher in the non-SFI scenario. The differences were due to the reduction in channel erosion resulting from the presence of SMZs. The effect of buffer zones in terms of sediment deposition was not different between scenarios, which can be attributed to the level slopes of the study area. Landscape measures of the SFI program, namely buffer zones, seem important in reducing channel degradation, particularly during major storm events, in intensively managed forest landscapes in East Texas.

TI The development of water quality methods within ecological Reserve
   assessments, and links to environmental flows
SO WATER SA
LA English
DT Article
DE environmental water quality; environmental flow requirements; ecological
   Reserve; water resource management
AB In the South African National Water Act (NWA, No 36 of 1998), the ecological Reserve is defined as the quality and quantity of water required to ensure appropriate protection of water resources, so as to secure ecologically sustainable development and use. Aquatic ecosystems are recognised as the core location of water resources, and although considerable progress has been made in developing methods for quantifying environmental flow requirements, this paper describes and discusses the first agreed method for quantifying environmental water quality requirements in an ecological Reserve assessment. Integration of flow and water quality is emphasised, and is based on the philosophy that environmental flows should be motivated to provide ecologically important flow-related habitat, or geomorphological function, but should not be motivated to solve water quality problems by dilution. Water quality is multivariate, and not all variables can be considered in an ecological Reserve assessment, but core water quality variables include: system variables (salts, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, temperature), nutrients (phosphate, nitrite, nitrate) and toxic substances (those listed in the South African Water Quality Guidelines for Aquatic Ecosystems, including toxic metal ions, toxic organic substances, and/or substances from a chemical inventory of an effluent or discharge). In addition, biological indicator data (e.g. SASS data), chlorophyll-a (e.g. phytoplankton and periphyton data) and toxicity test data may be used. For each variable, a concentration range or response is linked to a class within a water resource, classification system, where classes range from minimally to severely modified. There are five main stages in the environmental water,quality method:
   Initiate study and determine scope of assessment.
   Delineate water quality sub-units.
   Select sites and collect data and information.
   Determine, benchmarks, including generic boundary values (literature-based concentrations related to classes); the unimpacted, natural or reference condition; the present ecological state; and the contribution of water quality to the overall ecosystem importance and sensitivity.
   Provide quantified and qualitative water quality objectives for each ecosystem health class, and each variable in each resource unit. These steps are integrated with environmental flow assessment procedures. After environmental flows have been recommended to achieve a selected level of protection (class), flow-concentration relationships are modelled, and the likely water quality consequences of modified flows are provided to resource managers, who then decide on whether to allocate water for dilution and/or to address the pollution problem directly using source controls.

AB Spatial and temporal distribution patterns of big-eye tuna (Thunnus obesus) in the Indian Ocean. Zoological Studies 44(2): 260-270. The spatial and temporal distribution patterns of bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus) in the Indian Ocean were studied based on catch data of Taiwanese longline fishery during the period 1985 similar to 1999. We used a geographic information system (GIS) to compile a fishery database to statistically explore the catch per unit effort (CPUE), mean weight distribution, and the relationship between distribution and environmental factors. Results indicated that bigeye tuna were mainly distributed in tropical waters between 10 degrees N and 15 degrees S, although some scattered instances of high catches appeared outside this range. Sea surface temperature (SST) was the optimal environmental factor for predictions of monthly CPUE, but not for the mean weight index which showed a broader pattern. The monthly mean weight index was not correlated with monthly CPUE except in Dec. and Jan. CPUE hotspots generally occurred between 10 degrees N and 15 degrees S, but hotspots for mean weight index were concentrated in the west of this geographical range. Temporal trends of the CPUE and mean weight indices showed regional differences. Most of the monthly mean CPUE values in the 5 ecoregions showed no significant temporal trends, while the mean weight index showed an increasing pattern. The distributional patterns shown by the CPUE and weight indices of bigeye tuna in the Indian Ocean were similar to those in the Pacific Ocean. Given the current population status and the increasing fishing intensity to meet public demand, conservation measures must be considered to ensure a sustainable fishery.

AB The photooxidation of iron(II) in aqueous ethanol is less in presence of TiO2, ZrO2, V2O5, CeO2, ZnO, Fe2O3, CdO, PbO, SnO2, CdS, ZnS and Al2O3 than in their absence. The photogeneration of iron(III) was studied at different [Fe2+], amounts of semiconductors suspended, airflow rates, light intensities, solvent compositions and wavelengths of illumination. The catalysts show sustainable photocatalytic activity. The metal oxides and sulfides reduce iron(III), formed by the homogeneous photooxidation of iron(II). TiO2, CeO2, ZnO, Fe2O3, CdO, PbO, SnO2 and Al2O3 effectively suppress the photooxidation of iron(II); ZrO2, ZnS and US also suppress but not completely. At high catalyst-loading V2O5 catalyses the photooxidation of iron(II). The mechanisms of the photocatalytic processes are discussed. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

AB For a long time, trypanosomosis spread by the tsetse fly Glossina, constrained human settlement in the Lambwe Valley, a south-western Kenya rangeland. After lengthy efforts to control tsetse over many years, the valley is currently experiencing an increase in human population growth rate, and rapid changes in land-use and cover are taking place. Using time-series aerial photograph interpretation, social survey methods, and a review of human population trends over five decades, a three-fold expansion in cultivation in the settled areas over a 50-year period, with a consequent decrease in woody vegetation cover was identified. In the Ruma National Park, occupying a third of the valley floor, shrublands and thickets have expanded while open grasslands have decreased. The sudden increase of land under cultivation adjacent to prime agricultural land designated for wildlife conservation, exacerbated by bush encroachment and dwindling resources for tsetse control could provide a situation suitable for land-use conflicts. Sustainability of this unique rangeland is dependent on how judiciously the resources are shared among all stakeholders in the valley. This study suggests continued tsetse surveillance and agricultural intensification in the settled areas to minimise chances of conflicts in land-use. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The increasing anthropogenic pressure on natural environments results in impacts that affect tropical forest areas and their biodiversity [1, 2]. Adverse impacts on terrestrial and oceanic environments often compound in the intertidal area, where mangrove forest ecosystems thrive. In tropical coastal areas of many developing countries where people depend on wood and other mangrove forest products and services, forest degradation leads to socioeconomic problems. At the same time, increasing freshwater needs in these areas are expected to cause additional problems [3-5]. On the basis of remote sensing and ground truthing complemented by colonial archival material from the Dutch East India Company (1602-1800), we report that changes to the historic system of inland freshwater management have increased dramatically in recent times. Hydrological changes, such as interbasin transfers, have resulted in a qualitative ecological and socioeconomic degradation in three coastal lagoons in southern Sri Lanka. Variations in river hydrology have caused changes in the areas suitable as mangrove habitat and, thus, have resulted in an altered distribution. However, increases in mangrove area can mask the degradation of the site in terms of floristic composition, significance of the species, and biodiversity (this effect is termed "cryptic ecological degradation"). It is important that such changes be carefully monitored to ensure biological and socioeconomic sustainability.

TI Methane combustion over PdO crystallite manipulated by support template

DT Article

ID CATALYTIC COMBUSTION; OXIDATION
AB A comparative investigation on the thermochemical and catalytic properties of palladium oxide crystallite supported on monoclinic or tetragonal-doped zirconia, demonstrated that by sharing the interfacial atoms with monoclinic zirconia, PdO crystallite aggregates at the aid of this epitaxy on the support template to acquire better dispersion. Moreover, tracking the heating-cooling cycles in air atmosphere, DTG analysis illustrated that the crystallized PdO gradually transforms into the epitaxial PdO species on the monochnic zirconia and the improved mobility of oxygen in lattices promotes the oxidative regeneration of PdO at high temperature thereby. Combining the above two superiorities on aggregation forms of NO, the template of monoclinic zirconia inhibits the high temperature deactivation of catalysts for methane combustion, meanwhile, increases the stability of combustion reaction and the sustainability of catalysts. However, the doping of tetragonal zirconia into monoclinic support muffles those advantages prominently.

AB There is a lack of information on the environmental effects of urban change and the dynamics of greenspace. Such information is essential for a better understanding of the sustainability of urban development processes, both planned and unplanned. We therefore investigated the changes in land use and land cover of 11 residential areas in Merseyside, UK, using aerial photographs taken in 1975 and 2000. We then modeled how these changes would alter three important environmental parameters: surface temperature, runoff of rainfall, and greenspace diversity. These changes were then related to the socio-economic status of the areas, as measured by an index of multiple deprivation. The comparisons revealed a loss of greenspace in all 11 case study sites Overall, the more affluent, low density areas lost more greenspace, especially of tree cover. A major cause was infill development whereby gardens were built over. However, greenspace was also lost in already densely built-up, deprived areas due to the reuse of derelict land. As a consequence, the models used in this study predicted negative environmental impacts for all areas. The results emphasize the need to critically review concepts such as urban densification and give more weight to the preservation and management of urban greenspaces. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB Cadmium oxide (CdO) photocatalyses the oxidation of aniline to azobenzene and shows sustainable catalytic activity. The reaction in ethanol was studied with natural sunlight and UV irradiation (365 nm) as a function of [aniline], catalyst loading, airflow rate, solvent composition, etc. The effects on the rate of solar oxidation are similar to those with UV light The problem of fluctuation of sunlight intensity is overcome by carrying out a set of experiments simultaneously to compare the results. The yield of the product is higher with illumination at 254 rather than at 365 nm. Electron donors enhance photocatalysis and singlet oxygen quencher fails to inhibit catalysis. Photocatalysis occurs in protic as well as aprotic solvents. The mechanism of photocatalysis is discussed and the product formation analysed using a kinetic model.

AB Dynamism and complexity are terms that have been related to soils. New approaches and points of view have been researched during past decades considering soil's multiple functions and integrating physical, chemical, and biological soil attributes. Also new mathematical models have been explored such as fractal sets and multifractal measures. Characterization of soil particle-size distribution is a key move towards modeling of soils and their behavior with respect to water movement and retention or soil erosion. Modeling soil physical properties related with soil production or degradation and finding indexes of characterization have been set as priorities in many programs related to ecology, sustainable agriculture, etc. Combination of multifractal techniques and laser diffractometry of soil particles have a potential to develop such characterization via analysis of rarely explored regions of the interval of sizes. Multifractal analysis can be applied using Renyi dimensions to detect scaling properties in soil particle distributions. However, specifics of the laser diffraction data require the construction of a new measure with which multifractal techniques may be applied. We developed such a measure and applied the Renyi dimension analysis to 20 soil particle-size distributions obtained by laser diffractometry. These distributions showed, in general, suitable scaling properties, generating Renyi dimensions spectra similar to those obtained for theoretical multifractal properties and showing great variety in their multifractal behavior. Results suggest the applicability of Renyi dimensions spectra to soil characterization for modeling empirical data and generating synthetic data by means of algorithms capable of generating such kind of measures.

AB An ammonia alkaline electrolytic cell for the production of hydrogen is presented. Challenges involved in using ammonia electro-oxidation for sustainable, low-cost, high-purity hydrogen production are identified and solutions are proposed. Electrodeposition was selected as a technique of preparing low-loading ammonia electrocatalysts. The efficiency of the electrolytic cell was improved by using bimetallic electrodeposited catalysts (at both electrodes) containing Pt and a low concentration of secondary metals (Ru, Ir). Pt-Ir deposits showed the highest activity toward ammonia oxidation. An experimental procedure is shown which minimizes the reversible deactivation of the electrode. Significant cur-rent densities were obtained (above 100 mA cm(-2)) during electrolysis testing at relatively low metal loading, low cell voltages, and high cell efficiencies. These results point to ammonia electrolysis as a promising candidate for an alternative process for low-cost, low-temperature, high-purity hydrogen production. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB Canada's ability to sustainably manage approximately 10% of the global forest cover is a critical environmental and economic issue. The capacity to meet such demands and to deliver on national and international commitments regarding forest management is enabled through collaboration between federal, provincial, and territorial agencies. A principal collaborator is the National Forest Inventory (NFI); a systematic photo-plot based monitoring system designed specifically for reporting purposes and as an important input for scientific models. Satellite imagery is illustrated here as a support data set to ensure the quality of the NFI, for auditing the photo-plot contents, and to detect spatial biases. The Canadian Forest Service, in collaboration with the Canadian Space Agency and other federal and provincial agencies, is producing a national land cover database of the forested area of Canada (Earth Observation for Sustainable Development of Forests (EOSD)) using Landsat-7 ETM+ data for circa 2000 conditions. The integration between the plot-based NFI with classified EOSD data is presented for central British Columbia, an area comprising 6 Landsat scenes and 324 2 km x 2 km photo-plots. Traditional accuracy assessment measures based on the analysis of coincidence matrices are reported as levels of agreement for hierarchically aggregated land cover categories (overall agreements of 91%, 79%, 64% and 26% for 3, 4, 6 and 20 classes respectively) to demonstrate coincidence between the different data products. Local agreement between NFI and EOSD is demonstrated as a means of photo-plot auditing while spatial biases are detected through investigations of geographic pattern in the coincidence values. The illustrated approaches may be expanded or applied to different mapped attributes (e.g., biomass) that are of utility to those attempting to characterize large areas in a consistent and rigorous fashion.

SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH

DE optimal pricing; perishable goods; purchase restriction
ID DISCOUNTS
AB The aim of this paper is to investigate the validity of the optimality results derived from [Eur. J. Oper. Res. 134 (2001) 631] by relaxing the following two assumptions: (a) the firm offers restricted units first and then unrestricted units later at higher price levels, and (b) only one type of product is available during the whole selling process. In the absence of (a), we establish a general optimality theorem, which shows that any optimal policy in [Eur. J. Oper. Res. 134 (2001) 631] remains to be optimal in the class of general policies that allow the restriction to be attached at any price level. For the simultaneous availability issue associated with (b), we demonstrate that there always exists an optimal policy that is sustainable even when all active prices are made available at the same time. These two results assure the relevance of the theoretical model in [Eur. J. Oper. Res. 134 (2001) 631] to current yield management practices and further improve our understanding on the role and the impact of a well-designed purchase restriction on pricing decisions.

AB In the present work we describe a comprehensive analysis of sulfide oxidation in a fluidized bed reactor (FBR) from an environmentally sustainable, zero-discharge mariculture system. The FBR received oxygen-depleted effluent from a digestion basin (DB) that is responsible for gasification of organic matter and nitrogen. The FBR is a crucial component in this recirculating system because it safeguards the fish from the toxic sulfide produced in the DB. Microscale sulfide oxidation potential and bacterial community composition within FBR biofilms were correlated to biofilter performance by integrating bulk chemical, microsensor (O-2, pH, and H2S), and molecular microbial community analyses. The FBR consistently oxidized sulfide during two years of continuous operation, with an estimated average sulfide removal rate of 1.3 g of sulfide-S L-FBR(-1) d(-1). Maximum sulfide oxidation rates within the FBR biofilms were 0.36 and 0.21 mg of sulfide-S cm(-3) h(-1) in the oxic and anoxic layers, respectively, indicating that both oxygen and nitrate serve as electron acceptors for sulfide oxidation. The estimated anoxic sulfide removal rate, as extrapolated from bench scale, autotrophic, nitrate-amended experiments, was 0.7 g of sulfide-S L-FBR(-1) d(-1), which is approximately 50% of the total estimated sulfide removal in the FBR. Community composition analyses using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of bacterial 16S rRNA gene fragments from FBR samples taken at six-month intervals revealed several sequences that were closely affiliated with sulfide-oxidizing bacteria. These included the denitrifying, sulfide-oxidizing bacteria Thiomicrospira denitrificans, members of the filamentous Thiothrix genus, and sulfide-oxidizing symbionts from the Gammaproteobacteria. In addition, marine Alphaproteobacteria and Bacteroidetes species were present in all of the DGGE profiles examined. DGGE analyses showed significant shifts in the bacterial community composition between profiles over two years of sampling, indicating the presence of a diverse and dynamic microbial community within the functionally stable FBR. The FBR's combined capacity for both oxic and anoxic sulfide oxidation, as indicated by bulk chemical, microsensor, and molecular microbial analyses, gives it significant functional elasticity, which is crucial for proper performance in the dynamic environment of this mariculture system.

AB By using an anion-exchanging method, about 90% of the O- anions in the C12A7-O- microporous crystal ([Ca24Al28O64](4+)center dot 4O(-)) have been substituted primarily by the H- anions, leading to the successful formation of a new H- emission material, C12A7-H- ([Ca24Al28O64](4+)center dot 4H(-)). A sustainable and stable emission of H-, in a current density of mu A/cm(2) level, has been obtained by supplying H-2 and electrons on the backside of the C12A7-H- sample. The emission features of C12A7-H-, including temperature and field effects, have been investigated. It is expected that the present material could be practically used as an H- anion generator.

AB The main objective of the present study is to investigate the performance characteristics of a solar-assisted ground-source heat pump system (SAGSHPS) for greenhouse heating with a 50 m vertical 1(1)/(4) in nominal diameter U-bend ground heat exchanger. This system was designed and installed in the Solar Energy Institute, Ege University, Izmir (568 degree days cooling, base: 22degreesC, 1226 degree days heating, base: 18degreesC), Turkey. Based upon the measurements made in the heating mode, the heat extraction rate from the soil is found to be, on average, 54.08 Wm(-1) of bore depth, while the required borehole length in meter per kW of heating capacity is obtained as 12.57. The entering water temperature to the unit ranges from 8.2 to 16.2degreesC, with an average value of 9.1degreesC. The greenhouse air is at a maximum day temperature of 25degreesC and night temperature of 14degreesC with a relative humidity of 40%. The heating coefficient of performance of the heat PUMP (COPHP) is about 2.13 at the end of a cloudy day, while it is about 2.84 at the end of sunny day and fluctuates between these values in other times. The COP values for the whole system are also obtained to be 5-15% lower than COPHP. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

ID CANOPY
AB Sustainable forest management requires accurate and up-to-date information, which can nowadays be obtained using digital earth observation technology. This paper introduces a modified change vector analysis (mCVA) approach and conceptually contrasts it against traditional CVA. The results of a comparative study between this change detection algorithm and three other widely used change detection algorithms: standardized differencing, ratioing and selective principal component analysis are summarized. Landsat Thematic Mappper (TM) imagery and detailed change maps of a forested area in Northern Minnesota were used. Change indicators (vegetation indices) were grouped into three conceptually independent categories corresponding to soil, vegetation and moisture characteristics. Change periods of two, four and six years were considered. All change detection outputs were multidimensional and of a continuous nature, and could therefore be subjected to a supervised maximum likelihood algorithm using identical data training sets. Change extraction accuracies were determined by computing overall accuracy and Kappa coefficients of agreement against independent reference datasets. The mCVA outperformed the three other change detection methods in all cases, and we have shown that there is a clear advantage in running mCVA with three change indicator inputs where each input comes from a different change indicator category. Further validations with more detailed reference data are needed to improve this method and test its performance for other types of change events.

AB This paper presents the methodology applied and results obtained from testing the Decision Support System 'mDSS' developed by the MULINO Project (Multi-sectoral, integrated and operational decision support system for the sustainable use of water resources at the catchment scale), for assessing alternative measures for the reduction of nitrogen pressure from agriculture on water resources at European level. The European policy background is set by the EU Nitrates Directive (91/676/EEC) and the Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC). The nature of the research is exploratory. It is aimed in particular at testing the usefulness of available official statistics for ex ante evaluations of alternative policy measures at the European scale, and the feasibility of such operations within the newly released mDSS software.
   Alternative measures for reducing N-pressure and spatial targets were designed and simulated in a GIS environment based on raster maps of 1 km resolution. The geographic extent of the present work is defined as the agricultural land of EU15. Data deriving from official statistics were used to calculate a simplified nitrogen balance, in which the sources of nitrogen are separated into organic (livestock manure) and mineral fertilisers, to distinguish the potential contribution of livestock and crop productions to water pollution at the river basin scale. Spatial indicators and evaluation indices were defined within a conceptual framework. For the study the DPSIR approach (Driving force, Pressure, State, Impact, Response), proposed by the European Environmental Agency, was adopted. The approach was subsequently elaborated by means of the multi-criteria functionality provided by mDSS.
   The results of this application test at the regional scale highlight the potential of the tool for evaluating the effects of policy measures targeted at different spatial implementation strategies through the application of simple screening models and using available data covering the EU15. The paper also contributes to identifying current strengths and weaknesses of available information, of the adopted methodology and the DSS tool. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Indirect partial oxidation (IPOX) of propane was studied over bimetallic 0.2 wt.% Pt-15 wt.% Ni/delta-Al2O3 catalyst in the 623-743 K temperature range. The unreduced and reduced forms of the catalyst were characterized by ESEM-EDAX and X-ray diffraction (XRD). In the IPOX tests, the effects of steam to carbon ratio (S/C), carbon to oxygen ratio (C/O-2) and residence time (W/F (g(cut) h/mol HC)) on the hydrogen production activity, selectivity and product distribution were studied in detail. The effect of temperature program applied (increasing from 623 to 743 K, ITP; decreasing from 743 to 623 K, DTP) during reaction was also tested. The results showed that the Pt-Ni bimetallic system has superior performance characteristics compared to the monometallic catalysts reported in literature. The reason is thought to be the utilization of the catalyst particles as micro heat exchangers during IPOX; the heat generated by Pt sites during exothermic total oxidation (TOX) being readily transfer-red through the catalyst particles acting as micro heat exchangers to the Ni sites, which promote endothermic steam reforming (SR). The optimal conditions were found as S/C = 3, C/O-2 = 2.70 and W/F = 0.51 g(cat) h/mol HC for IPOX of propane on the basis of high hydrogen productivity and selectivity between 623 and 748 K for the experimental conditions tested. The thermo-neutral points obtained showed the sustainability of reaction in terms of energy. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Planning management activities for a long-term sustainable forestry requires predictive tools designed for this kind of management. Many tools available today are either designed for planning periods that are too short to consider long-term sustainability, omit important parts of the forest ecosystem or are not capable of considering environmental changes. A long-term potential growth-limiting factor is the supply of available base cations as was demonstrated in an earlier study for a research area in southern Sweden. This paper presents the ForSAFE model, a computer implemented model system where four robust and well evaluated stand-alone models are combined to a dynamic model that considers vegetation and soil as well as the links between them. The system dynamics approach with causal loop diagrams (CLD) and feedback loop analysis (FLA) is presented as a useful tool for conceptualizing and constructing ecosystem models.

AB The impacts that stand treatments have on carbon, nitrogen and water cycles is a key question relating the sustainability of forests to individual forest management decisions. While the response of the above ground carbon cycle may be relatively easy to measure and is well understood, e.g. volume growth response due to thinning, the impact of stand treatment and different harvesting scenarios on the water, and nutritional status of the remaining trees and site as well as on the below ground carbon and nitrogen cycle is much more difficult to assess due to the difficulty of obtaining reliable data. An alternative that eliminates the need for detailed site-specific data is to use existing models that were explicitly designed for studying biogeochemical processes. In this paper we test and evaluate the applicability of a species-specific mechanistic biogeochemical model to assess the impact of different harvesting scenarios after thinning. Data are available from 36 Norway spruce stands covering three regions each with three harvesting scenarios after thinning and four replications. The different harvesting scenarios applied are: (1) whole tree harvest, (2) whole tree harvest after one vegetation period, i.e. without needles, and (3) commercial stem wood harvest. The modeling results suggest that the variant 3 exhibited the highest growth efficiency, a measure of net carbon uptake or growth, versus all other harvesting methods. This is confirmed by the available field observations. Nitrogen, an indicator of nutrient supply, behaved similarly. The important exception was nitrogen plant uptake, which was lower immediately after thinning on the sites where the lowest amount of biomass was removed. Significant relationships exist between observed versus modeled stand volume and volume growth suggesting that mechanistic modeling is a suitable diagnostic tool for analyzing the impacts of different management practices and thus, such models can be efficiently used to enhance silvicultural decision-making.

AB Harvest scheduling models are decision support systems used to project sustainable harvest volumes while maintaining social and ecological objectives. We present a robustness test for these projections that measure the possible level of deviation between projection and implementation while still meeting projected target levels. Results using both simulation and optimization models indicate that when using a maximum sustainable volume objective, the projections have very little robustness. Reducing the target volume increases robustness, but with a large cost to the sustainable timber harvest level. Matching the level of uncertainty in the planning environment with corresponding level of robustness in projections is an important factor in creating sustainable forest management plans.

AB Over the previous decade, sustainable forest management (SFM) has become a highly relevant topic both in forest and environmental policy. Criteria and indicators (C&I) are primarily used in implementing the principles of SFM at national, regional, and at forest management unit levels. In turning SFM from a conceptual framework into applicable guidelines at the operational scale, several limitations have to be acknowledged: (i) partial lack of knowledge, (ii) deficits about dependencies and feedbacks among system components represented by C&I, and (iii) knowledge gaps regarding impacts and related uncertainties. Several methodologies have been proposed to implement C&I-based SFM. Multi-criteria analysis is often used to analyze and evaluate multiple C&I approaches. This study compares two different multi-criteria analysis approaches: the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) with a hierarchical structure and the analytic network process (ANP) with a network structure. Comparisons are made for evaluating sustainable management strategies at forest management-unit level by using a C&I approach based on the Pan-European guidelines for SFM. AHP and ANP are used to compare four different strategic management options with a set of six criteria and 43 indicators. Differences in evaluation results between AHP and ANP are discussed, as well as strengths and weaknesses of both approaches for SFM. Needs and demands are derived for successful future applications in forestry decision-making. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID PUBLIC-PARTICIPATION
AB While there is an increasing demand for active public involvement in forestry decision-making, there are as yet few successful models for achieving this in the new sustainable forest management (SFM) context. This paper describes the special needs of forest managers conducting participatory SFM planning in a sometimes-polarized public context, and outlines criteria for designing decision-support processes to meet these needs. These criteria were used to develop a new approach to public participation in British Columbia, by means of a pilot study using multi-criteria analysis of forest management scenarios while integrating public priorities. Researchers, working with stakeholder groups in the Arrow Forest District, obtained public weightings of criteria and indicators for SFM. Alternative forest management scenarios were presented using realistic 3D landscape visualisations. Modelling-based expert evaluations of the scenarios were weighted according to the priorities of the stakeholder groups, in order to test implications for scenario preferences. There was considerable commonality of results among groups, with general agreement between experts and stakeholder groups on scenario preferences. Based on the results and participant evaluations, techniques such as this appear effective as decision-support tools in conflict-prone areas. Pilot studies like these can play a vital role in developing a more comprehensive, engaging, open and accountable process to support informed and socially acceptable decision-making for sustainable forest management.

AB Sixty-four different tree-harvesting scenarios in an initially undisturbed Dipterocarp lowland rain forest stand in Sabah (Malaysia) were simulated with the rain forest growth model FORMIND. The scenarios differ in terms of their minimum cutting diameter, logging cycle, method and intensity. The simulation results include harvest yields and the impact on forest structure (canopy opening and changes in species composition). Multicriteria decision analysis was used to evaluate the scenarios and identify optimum ones by applying a stochastic extension of the PROMETHEE method.
   Almost all optimum scenarios used reduced-impact logging. High cutting limits or low logging intensities could not compensate for the high damage caused by conventional logging techniques. Five scenarios proved to be optimum for a wide range of priorities concerning different forest functions. They all use reduced-impact logging and long logging cycles (>= 60 years), either with a minimum cutting limit of 50 or 60 cm stem diameter, or with medium logging intensities. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB Plants are now gaining widespread acceptance as a general platform for the large-scale production of recombinant proteins. The principle has been demonstrated by the success of a diverse repertoire of proteins, with therapeutic molecules showing the most potential for added value. Over the past 10 years, several efficient plant-based expression systems have emerged. However, a number of issues remain to be addressed before plant bioreactors can be accepted and adopted widely in preference to the established microbial and mammalian platforms. Overcoming bottlenecks imposed by low yields, poor and inconsistent product quality and difficulties with downstream processing are the most important goals for researchers working in this field. The achievement of these goals is conditional on the development of extraction and processing steps that comply with GMP standards, including extensive quality assurance and control procedures. Such rigorous and validated standards should be combined with measures applied earlier in production to ensure product sustainability and quality, such as the use of master seed banking procedures. Moreover, there are several further challenges concerning topics of environmental impact, biosafety and risk assessment, which reflect the release of transgenic plants, as well the safety of the plant-derived products themselves.
   We are facing a growing demand for protein diagnostics and therapeutics, but lack the capacity to meet those demands using established facilities. A shift to plant bioreactors may, therefore, become necessary within the next few years, making it more imperative that the technical and regulatory limitations are addressed and solved. The production of pharmaceutical proteins in plants will only realize its huge potential if the products are provided at consistent high quality levels, allowing the delivery of clinical grade proteins that will gain regulatory approval and which can be used routinely in clinical trials.

AB To minimize purchased inputs, sustainable agriculture systems often use green- or animal-manure as a nitrogen source for crops. The addition of these materials also have positive impacts on soil phosphorus (P) availability. This study was conducted to investigate the effects of animal- and legume-based cropping systems in place for 5-13 years on the chemistry of organic matter and soil R Two cropping systems, Potato Ecosystem (ECO) located in Presque Isle, ME, U.S.A. and Grass Fertility (GF) located in Stillwater, ME, U.S.A. received animal manure. Two others, Liebman E Rotation (LER) in Stillwater, ME, U.S.A. and Porter Rotation (PR) in Presque Isle, ME, U.S.A. were primarily legume-based rotations. Estimated difference in carbon input (ha(-1) year(-1)) between the amended and control plots were: ECO, 8 100 kg C; GF, 1010 kg; LER, 950 kg C; and PR, 415 kg C. The dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration was higher (P < 0.10) in the treatment that received animal manure than those which only received legume residue. The E2/E3 spectrophotometric test indicated that the DOC extracted from the ECO manure-treated plots was more humified than that from the ECO control plots. There were no significant differences between the amended and control treatments in Olsen P or total P for all the tested cropping systems. Similar to that of the DOC response, the ECO cropping system that received animal manure recorded higher concentrations of water soluble P (P < 0.05). There was a linear relationship between DOC and water-soluble P concentrations of the soil:water extract across soils, indicating a positive relationship between them. To determine the effects of the different cropping systems on P bioavailability, a simulation model was used to study how changes in P soil chemistry may affect P uptake by crops. The simulation runs showed that predicted P uptake was greater for the animal manure based ECO and GF systems, but not for the legume based LER and PR systems (P < 0.05). This study shows that cropping systems that include animal manure may increase soil P availability. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB On December 6, 2002, the Forest Service published a proposed planning regulation that provides a framework for community-based collaborative planning for sustainability, alters the spatial and temporal scales of public involvement, and replaces postdecisional appeals of forest plans with a predecisional objection process. This article examines the potential effects of community-based collaborative planning on national environmental stakeholders and explores what it means to be accountable to a national constituency. The author argues that the focus on the community of place in collaborative planning, compounded by the loss of appeals, undermines the democratic accountability of the forest planning processes.

ID PASTURES
AB In Central Brazil, the long-term, sustainability of beef cattle systems is under threat over vast tracts of farming areas, as more than half of the 50 million hectares of sown pastures are suffering from. degradation. Overgrazing practised to maintain high stocking rates is regarded as one of the main causes. High stocking rates are deliberate and crucial decisions taken by the farmers, which appear paradoxical, even irrational given the state of knowledge regarding the consequences of overgrazing. The phenomenon however appears inextricably linked with the objectives that farmers hold. In this research those objectives were elicited first and from their ranking two, 'asset value of cattle (representing cattle ownership and 'present value of economic returns', were chosen to develop an original bi-criteria Compromise Programming model to test various hypotheses postulated to explain the overgrazing behaviour. As part of the model a pasture productivity index is derived to estimate the pasture recovery cost. Different scenarios based on farmers' attitudes towards overgrazing, pasture costs and capital availability were analysed. The results of the model runs show that benefits from holding more cattle can outweigh the increased pasture recovery and maintenance costs. This result undermines the hypothesis that farmers practise overgrazing because they are unaware or uncaring caring about overgrazing costs. An appropriate approach to the problem of pasture degradation requires information on the economics,and its interplay with farmers' objectives, for a wide range of pasture recovery and maintenance methods. Seen within the context of farmers' objectives, some level of overgrazing appears rational. Advocacy of the simple 'no overgrazing' rule is an insufficient strategy to maintain the long-term sustainability of the beef production systems in Central Brazil. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Reasons for converting to organic farming have been studied in a number of instances. However, the underlying rationale that motivates the behavior is not always made clear. This study aims to provide a detailed picture of farmers' decision-making and illustrate the choice between organic and conventional farm management. Based on 21 interviews with farmers, a decision-tree highlighting the reasons and constraints involved in the decision of farmers to use, or not to use, organic production techniques was formulated. The accuracy of the decision-tree was tested through a written survey of 65 randomly sampled farmers. The decision-tree permits the identification of decision criteria and examines the decision-making process of farmers in choosing their farming method. It also allows for the characterization of farmer strategies and values, identifying five types of farmers: the "committed conventional;" the "pragmatic conventional;" the "environment-conscious but not organic;" the "pragmatic organic;" and the "committed organic." The importance of taking into account heterogeneity in farmers' attitudes, preferences, and goals and their impact on the choice of a fanning method is emphasized.

AB Recent developments in agriculture have stirred up interest in the concept of "sustainable" farming systems. Still it is difficult to determine the extent to which certain agricultural practices can be considered sustainable or not. Aiming at identifying the necessary attributes with respect to sustainability in Dutch dairy farming in the beginning of the third millennium, we first compiled a list of attributes referring to all farming activities with their related side effects with respect to economic, internal social, external social, and ecological sustainability. A wide range of people (i.e., experts and stakeholders) were consulted to contribute to our list of attributes. Our consultation showed that only one attribute was selected for economic and internal social sustainability: profitability and working conditions, respectively. The list for external social sustainability contained 19 attributes and the list for ecological sustainability contained 15 attributes. To assess their relative importance, the same experts and stakeholders ranked the attributes for external social and ecological sustainability by using a questionnaire. The most important attributes for external social sustainability were food safety, animal health, animal welfare, landscape quality, and cattle grazing. For ecological sustainability they were eutrophication, groundwater pollution, dehydration of the soil, acidification, and biodiversity. The present method for identifying and ranking attributes is universal and, therefore, can be used for other agricultural sectors, for other countries, and for other time periods.

AB The improvement of the welfare of inhabitants of and and semi-arid lands, either through the enhancement of existing livelihoods or the promotion of alternative ones, and their potential constraints are discussed. Alternative livelihoods are discussed under regenerative and extractive themes with respect to environmental stability. Regenerative (i.e., non-extractive) livelihoods include activities like apiculture, poultry keeping, pisciculture, silkworm production, drought tolerant cash cropping, horticulture, community wildlife tourism, processing of livestock and crop products, agro-forestry for tree products, and micro-enterprises in the informal sector. Examples of livelihoods that are extractive or potentially so include timber production, woodcarving, basketry, brick making, sand scooping, and charcoal making. Suggestions to improve these livelihoods in a sustainable manner are offered.

Our objectives were twofold: (i) evaluate impacts of crop sequencing on precipitation use and (ii) show how crop sequencing can accentuate synergistic interactions among crops. Crop-fallow systems that developed in the Great Plains resulted in precipitation storage efficiencies of about 20% in the early 1930s to about 40% in the late 1980s. Integrated crop-livestock systems have been developed in the southern Great Plains to take advantage of bimodal annual precipitation pattern to produce high quality pigeonpea [Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp.] forage during the noncrop period between winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) harvest and seeding. Pigeonpea can be grown after a mid-June winter wheat harvest since pigeonpea uses precipitation received from wheat harvest to late September and pigeonpea has a root system that allows it to use soil water below the effective rooting depth of wheat. In the central Great Plains, water-use efficiency of winter wheat was improved 18 to 56% by including broadleaf crop in a grass-based rotation. Cropping systems in the northern Great Plains tend to be more diverse, and research at Mandan, ND, suggests that seed yield of flax (Linum usitatissium L.) can be tripled with a safflower (Carthamus tinctorius L.)-flax crop sequence vs. a flax-flax crop sequence. Great Plains cropping systems of the future will not only need to take advantage of crop sequences through synergism, but also take advantage of the interactions associated with diversity in space (polyculture).

TI The SUCOZOMA program: Results and challenges
SO AMBIO
LA English
DT Article
AB The research program Sustainable Coastal Zone Management (SUCOZOMA), which was started in 1996 by the Swedish Foundation of Strategic Environmental Research, was motivated by the recognition of increasingly severe global, regional and national coastal problems. The program approached the complex issues of coastal eutrophication, fishing practices, and overexploited coastal resources, with a concerted effort involving multidisciplinarity, stakeholder cooperation, and a focus on the problems perceived as most serious by the public and decision-makers. As the program was concluded in 2004 it had resulted in the completion or near-completion of 22 doctoral dissertations and approximately one hundred publications, More than 40 scientists were involved in the program. Goteborg University was the host university, but important research teams have also been located at Stockholm University, the Beijer Institute, and the Kristineberg Marine Research Station of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, and within the National Board of Fisheries. During the program, networks of stakeholders were established and SUCOZOMA had contributed to numerous political and administrative processes relevant for integrated coastal zone management (ICZM). SUCOZOMA program results can be grouped into different categories. Many of the projects in the two phases of the program produced results which can be defined as technical or practical and available for direct implementation in, e.g. mussel cultivation, restoration and safeguarding of spawning areas, seal-safe fishing gear or sustainable fishing of underexploited species. Other results can be characterized as policy oriented, and the impact of these can only be fairly evaluated as new policies are put into effect. SUCOZOMA resulted in important new knowledge regarding coastal science and management, but also concerning the organization required to conduct an end-user oriented multidisciplinary program effectively.

TI Interdisciplinary conflict analysis and conflict mitigation in local
   resource management
SO AMBIO
LA English
DT Article
AB Within the Swedish research program SUCOZOMA (Sustainable Coastal Zone Management) several conflict studies have been carried out. Whereas the detailed results of these studies are published separately, this paper reviews important results from conflict research in combination with a summarizing and generalizing discussion of approaches and main results of SUCOZOMA's resource and conflicts studies. After an analysis of interdisciplinary and theoretical research about environmental and resource use conflicts, the methodology used in SUCOZOMA is presented, a combined stakeholder and conflict analysis. It can be summarized in four main points: i) to map the stakeholders and their interests; ii) to analyse the conflicts; iii) to develop methods for conflict mitigation and cooperation with stakeholders; iv) to integrate these components in a system for the management of natural resources. Exemplary case studies of resource use conflicts have been carried out at the Swedish west and east coast including coastal fishery, mussel culture, coastal planning and specific conflicts such as between species protection (seals) and coastal fishery. Researchers are involved as experts and as conflicting parties, and the role of scientists as stakeholders deserves special attention in conflict research. Conflict management is not only for the solution of present conflicts, but part of integrated resource management systems where knowledge transfer, institutional development, collective learning of scientific, political and administrative actors, and cooperation between scientists and resource users can occur.

DT Article
AB This article analyses four main models of participation in Swedish natural resource management and assesses strengths and weaknesses of one model (participation in physical/spatial planning) based on empirical studies of coastal resource conflicts in two Swedish west coast municipalities. In comparison to other administrative and planning procedures, physical planning offers possibilities to coordinate land and water management across sectors and resources and to broaden stakeholder participation. Local influence on coastal management increases with participation beyond the statutory minimum requirements, although management frameworks and practice of participation need to be developed further. Besides educating professionals and experimenting with combinations of existing procedures, in the long run an adaptation of legislation to the requirements of integrated and sustainable coastal management will be necessary.

ID ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK; BALTIC SEA; COMANAGEMENT; LESSONS
AB Most of the Swedish coastal fisheries are not sustainable from either a social, economic or ecological point of view. We propose the introduction of local fisheries management (LFM) as a tool for restructuring the present large-scale management system in order to achieve sustainability. To implement LFM two questions need to be answered: How to distribute the resource fish among different resource user groups? How to restructure present fisheries management to meet the criteria of sustainability? Starting from these questions we describe possible forms of LFM for Swedish coastal fishery supported by recent research. The biological and social preconditions for restructuring fisheries management are derived from an analysis of the ecological and managerial situation in Swedish fishery. Three types of LFM-owner based, user based, and community based management-are analyzed with regard to the tasks to be carried out in LFM, the roles of management groups, and the definition and optimal size of management areas.

AB The pattern for distribution of genetic variation within and between populations is referred to as the genetic population structure of the species. To avoid depletion of genetic resources sustainable management should be based on knowledge of this structure. We discuss key aspects of genetic population structure in the context of identifying biological units for fisheries management, suggesting three basic types of structuring: distinct populations; continuous change; and no differentiation. The type of structure determines how units for genetically sustainable management are to be identified. We also review what is currently known regarding the genetic population structure of fishes exploited in the Swedish part of the Baltic Sea, and conclude that sufficient genetic information is lacking for most of the species. This is a serious problem, particularly considering that populations of several commercially exploited fishes are declining and some exhibit recruitment problems. For six species, Atlantic herring, Atlantic salmon, brown trout, European eel, turbot, and pike, sufficient genetic data are available to provide at least basic information on genetic structure and genetic units for biologically sustainable use. Current management practices do not sufficiently consider these data.

DT Article
AB This article confronts present main stream planning approaches against the perspective of ecological sustainability, as relevant for Rule of Law countries and based on a modern environmental law approach. It discusses the setting and implementation of environmental goals against the general experience of massive implementation deficits regarding environmental policies all over the world. In this confrontation, environmental planning, with at least some principles picked up from New Zealand's Resource Management Act, and much more taken from modern environmental law theory on legal operationalisation, is compared to adaptive management approaches which also allow for modifying the environment related goal if implementation fails or seems very difficult. The concept of adaptive environmental planning (AEP) is suggested as a possible road to choose for planning for sustainability, while maximizing development within the framework legally defined by means of environmental limits. This article presents five criteria, all of which must be met by AEP planning. One of these relates to a planning hierarchy which, among other things, leads to the conclusion that coastal planning, if it is intended to aim at sustainability, can not be dealt with in isolation, although such planning might have to meet very complex problems at the regional level.

AB The Swedish coastal zone is a scene of conflicting interests about various goods and services provided by nature. Open-access conditions and the public nature of many services increase the difficulty in resolving these conflicts. "Sustainability" is a vague but widely accepted guideline for finding reasonable trade-offs between different interests. The UN view of sustainable development suggests that coastal zone management should aim at a sustainable ecological, economic, and social-cultural development. Looking closer at economic sustainability, it is observed that economic analyses about whether changes in society imply a gain or a loss should take into account the economic value of the environment. Methods used for making such economic valuation in the context of the Swedish coastal zone are briefly reviewed. It is noted that the property rights context matters for the results of a valuation study. This general background is followed by a concise presentation of the design and results of four valuation studies on Swedish coastal zone issues. One study is on the economic value of an improved bathing water quality in the Stockholm archipelago. The other studies are a travel cost study about the economic value of improved recreational fisheries in the Stockholm archipelago, a replacement cost study on the value of restoring habitats for sea trout, and a choice experiment study on the economic value of improved water quality along the Swedish westcoast.

AB Purpose. To evaluate the effect of the Health Improvement Initiative (HII), a 5-year grantmaking initiative funded by The California Wellness Foundation designed to identify the critical factors needed to bring about population health improvements through community-level systems change.
   Design. The evaluation of the HII used a case-study, logic-model approach to make inferences about the effect of each community coalition (Health Partnership) on its target community. The primary outcome measure was the creation of significant and sustainable community-level systems change.
   Setting. The HII included nine communities in California that received funding to create broad-based Health Partnerships.
   Subjects. Primary data were collected from a variety of Initiative stakeholders by key informant interviews, closed-ended surveys, and participant observation.
   Intervention. The HII provided funding over 5 years to nine Health Partnerships that were intended to be a driving force in implementing community-level systems change. The ultimate objective of the systems change process was to improve "population health," broadly defined to include social, economic, and cultural determinants of health, in addition to traditional health status indicators.
   Measures. Both qualitative and quantitative techniques were used to assess the effect of the HII on key community systems. The primary outcomes were qualitative descriptions of community-level changes.
   Results. At the end of the 5 years of HII funding, six of the nine Partnerships had played a critical role in implementing sustainable systems changes that would likely have a significant effect in their target communities.
   Conclusion. The HII was successful in promoting community-level systems change in the majority of funded communities, although the evidence was mixed regarding the role, of the Partnerships in bringing about these changes.

TI An economic analysis of potential rotation crops for maine potato
   cropping systems
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POTATO RESEARCH
LA English

DE Monte-Carlo simulation; enterprise budgets; net income
ID RETURNS; CORN
AB Potato cropping systems in Maine include both continuous potatoes and short-term potato rotations with small grains. Producers recognize the benefits of increased rotations, but the economics of producing a high-valued crop such as potatoes (Solanum tuberosum L.) create incentives for continuous potato production. Research at the USDA-ARS research site in Newport, ME, is evaluating the agronomic and economic impacts of five crops in two-year rotations on potato production and whole-farm profitability. The rotation crops are barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), sweet corn (Zea mays L.) green bean (Phaseolus vulgares L.), soybean (Glycine max L., Mer.), and canola (Brassica napus L.). Enterprise budgets for the five crops were developed. The budgets and historical prices and yields were used as inputs to a Monte Carlo simulation. The simulation was conducted to determine the impact of rotation crops on whole-farm profitability and income risk, as measured by income variability. The net incomes of the five rotation sequences were compared against continuous potatoes. Two rotation crops, sweet corn and green beans, resulted in an increase in net income relative to continuous potatoes. All of the rotation crops were found to greatly reduce income risk and chance of economic losses. In the case of green beans and sweet corn, the analysis was rerun using data from the research trials on the following potato crop yields. Depending on whether the rotation effect was negative or positive, net income either fell or rose when compared to fist analysis. However, even when the rotation crop led to decreased yields in the following potato crop, income variability and likelihood of economic loss was still superior to the continuous potato rotation. These findings provide support for including rotation crops as a method to improve potato production and sustainability, increase whole-farm profitability, and reduce income risk.

AB High fidelity calcium carbonate and hydroxyapatite (bio) inorganic replicas of the fibrous network of the dried fruit of Luffa cylindrica are described, utilizing a facile synthetic route. The loofa sponge is a highly complex macroscopic architectural template, an inexpensive and sustainable resource. In the context of the morphosynthesis, the capability of replication of the loofa sponge opens the possibility of the use of biodiversity in obtaining new materials. We would Like to emphasize that the template proposed in this paper, makes possible the preparation of inorganic replicas with a very desirable size, on the centimeter scale. This fact is innovative with respect to inorganic replicas described in the literature, which predominate at the micrometric scale, limited to the original size of the template.

AB Animals have been used as medicinal resources for the treatment and relieve of a myriad of illnesses and diseases in practically every human culture. Although considered by many as superstition, the pertinence of traditional medicine based on animals cannot be denied since they have been methodically tested by pharmaceutical companies as sources of drugs to the modem medical science. The phenomenon of zootherapy represents a strong evidence of the medicinal use of animal resources. Indeed. drug companies and agribusiness firms have been evaluating animals for decades without paying anything to the countries from where these genetic resources are found. The use of animals' body parts as folk medicines is relevant because it implies additional pressure over critical wild populations. It is argued that many animal species have been overexploited as sources of medicines for the traditional trade. Additionally, animal populations have become depleted or endangered as a result of their use as experimental subjects or animal models. Research on zootherapy should be compatible with the welfare of the medicinal animals. and the use of their by-products should be done in a sustainable way. It is discussed that sustainability is now required as the guiding principle for biological conservation.

AB This paper presents the application of the eMergy evaluation, introduced by H.T. Odum as an efficient methodology of environmental accounting. The results of this analysis are a part of a wider sustainability assessment for the Province of Venice realized in 2003. Within a territorial sustainability analysis, it is necessary to implement ail environmental accounting method, which is able: to precisely consider the boundaries of the investigated system (spatial scale); to arbitrarily separate the life of the investigated system into periods (temporal scale); to account for both economic and natural support to a given territorial system in order to implement a sustainable management of resources; to assess all the items supporting the system on the basis of a physical unit that is objective (while the traditional economic evaluation method is based on individual preferences, hence it is subjective). The Province of Venice is a very complex system due, on one hand, to the heavy and consolidated presence of industrial activity since the beginning of the 20111 century and, on the other hand, to the principal natural ecosystem which characterizes it: the lagoon, the largest wetland in the Mediterranean Sea. The role of the lagoon. as a provider of resources and services is represented by the analysis of two aspects: the lagoon as an ecosystem on the basis of the evaluation of all flows that cyclically support its biotic activity and the lagoon as a productive system on the basis of the contribution of both natural and "economic" inputs that support human activity. In particular, the case of clam fishing will be presented to put on evidence the importance of natural inputs that are systematically neglected by the traditional accounting methodologies.

AB PURPOSE: Because many emerging economies lack local capacity for scientific research, capacity building has become a priority for many international development organizations. This article describes and critiques an approach used for building local capacity for applied health research in Azerbaijan, one of the newly independent states (NIS) of the former USSR.
   METHODS: In 2000, environmental epidemiology training courses were conducted in Azerbaijan. Several local participants of these courses received hands-on training in the planning and conduct of a subsequent cancer study as a practical extension of the training exercises.
   RESULTS: The research demonstrated that international collaboration can not only result in the successful completion of health research in NIS such as Azerbaijan, but also impart research knowledge and experience to local experts. Several practical issues were encountered in the conduct of the training activities that limited their effectiveness. The most desired result (the proposal and conduct of new research by local experts trained through these exercises) has yet to be achieved to the levels expected.
   CONCLUSIONS: International collaborations such as the approach described here are useful for imparting expertise to researchers in less affluent countries. However, comprehensive capacity building programs providing ongoing professional development, support, and an enabling environment, rather than scientific training alone, are required to achieve long-term sustainability and measurable outcomes.

AB Background: People with oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) have reduced levels of melanin in their hair, skin and eyes, with associated visual impairment and extreme sun sensitivity requiring lifelong monitoring. This genetic condition is surrounded by myth, superstition and fear in Africa, where affected individuals and their families may be rejected, shunned and excluded from their community.
   Objective: This review reports population studies in southern Africa to determine the distribution of people with OCA in this predominantly rural and relatively impoverished area - crucial information for health and education providers. Health and genetic care studies document the range of eye and skin problems experienced and suggest effective and sustainable ways to manage these needs in a low resource setting.
   Conclusion: Innovative genetic care programmes in northern South Africa facilitate low-cost management of albinism, raise self-esteem and promote community awareness, helping to improve the long-term health prospects and social integration of those affected. This holistic approach of dealing with albinism from both a medical and a sociological perspective could be applied in other areas of Africa where this condition is prevalent.

AB The biological control of the snail hosts of the trematodes that cause human schistosomiasis appears to be a promising method for achieving sustainable reductions in the transmission of the parasites. The possibility of using the Ghanaian strain of an ampullariid snail, Lanistes varicus, for the biological control of the main snail host of Schistosoma mansoni, Biomphalaria pfeifferi, has now been investigated in laboratory-based experiments. Adult and 2-week-old L. varicus were found to feed voraciously on the egg masses and juveniles of B. pfeifferi (from the Tono irrigation canals in northern Ghana). When single L. varicus were exposed to 20-200 egg masses, they consumed all of the masses over 24 h (if adult) or about 50% of them over 4 days (if 2-week-old juveniles). The effect of the secretions of the ampullariid on the reproduction, growth and mortality of B. pfeifferi was also investigated, by maintaining the two snail species in the same aquarium but separated by nylon netting. The presence of L. varicus in the same aquarium reduced the number of egg masses produced by each B. pfeifferi, although, curiously, the presence of a single L. varicus in the aquarium appeared to have more of an impact, on the egg-mass deposition by 20 B. pfeifferi, than the presence of five or more of the ampullariids. It appears that, under laboratory conditions at least, the Ghanaian stain of L. varicus has the potential to limit populations of B. pfeifferi.

AB Recent contributions by geographers on the relationships between states and citizens have documented the rise of rolled-out neoliberalism. Development agendas are, it is argued, increasingly dominated by the principles of market-driven reforms, social inequality, and a drive towards enhancing the economic competitiveness of the supply side of the economy. However, at the same time, a parallel set of discourses has emerged in the development literature which argues that it is principles of sustainable development that have, in practice, become dominant. The emphasis is, instead, on democratic empowerment, environmental conservation, and social justice. This paper examines the relationships between these ostensibly very different interpretations of contemporary development with an assessment of one of the Labour government's most ambitious planning agendas-the publication in February 2003 of the document Sustainable Communities: Building for the Future. The proposals are promoted as a "step change" in the planning system with a new emphasis on tackling shortages of housing in the South East and reviving the economy of the Thames Gateway area. The paper assesses the different ways in which such programmes can be interpreted and argues that contemporary development practices in countries such as Britain are constituted by a hybridity of approaches and rationalities and cannot be reduced to simple characterisations of rolled-out neoliberalism or sustainable development.

AB In recent years, the concept of producing biodiesel from renewable lipid sources has regained international attention. In Brazil, a national program was launched in 2002 to evaluate the technical, economic, and environmental competitiveness of biodiesel in relation to the commercially available diesel oil. Several research projects were initiated nationwide to investigate and/or optimize biodiesel production from renewable lipid sources and ethanol derived from sugarcane (ethyl esters). Once implemented, this program will not only decrease our dependence on petroleum derivatives but also create new market opportunities for agribusiness, opening new jobs in the countryside, improving the sustainability of our energy matrix, and helping the Brazilian government to support important actions against poverty. This article discusses the efforts to develop the Brazilian biodiesel program in the context of technical specifications as well as potential oilseed sources.

AB Alternative cropping systems can improve resource use efficiency, increase corn grain yield, and help in reducing negative impacts on the environment. A 6-yr (1993 to 1998) field study was conducted at the Iowa State University's Northeastern Research Center near Nashua, Iowa, to evaluate the effects of non-traditional cropping systems (strip inter cropping (STR)-corn (Zea mays L.)/soybean (Glycine max L.)/oats (Avina saliva L.)); alfalfa rotation (ROT)-3-yr (1993 to 1995) alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) followed by corn in 1996, soybean in 1997, and oats in 1998), and traditional cropping system (corn after soybean (CS) and soybean after corn (SC) on the flow weighted average nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) concentrations and NO3-N leaching losses with subsurface drainage water. The soils at the research site are loamy with 3% to 4% organic matter and are underlain by subsurface drainage system. The data collected from four experimental treatments were analyzed as an unbalanced incomplete block design using F-test and T-test among treatments and within treatments, respectively. When averaged across 6-yr, non-traditional cropping systems reduced flow weighted average NO3-N concentrations in subsurface drain water with highly significantly effect (P < 0.01) in comparison with traditional cropping system (6.5 vs. 11.2 mg L-(1)). Similarly, the strip inter cropping system increased corn grain yields by 5% (9.03 vs. 8.6 Mg ha-(1)) and reduced NO3-N leaching losses by 6% (12.6 vs. 13.5 kg-N ha-(1)) and showed no difference in soybean yields when compared with traditional cropping system. Results of the study indicate that strip inter cropping and alfalfa rotation systems have the potential to reduce NO3-N leaching into the shallow groundwater system and possibly can become one of the better sustainable farming systems in Midwestern agriculture.

AB The study compared the effects of mowing, mulching, and no-treatment, applied to a mountain grassland over five years, on microbial transformation of soil organic matter (SOM). Microbial biomass, microbial,respiration, cellulose decomposition and mineralization were measured in the laboratory eight times during the three-year experiment. In addition, soil phosphatase, P activity and factors limiting microbial growth were assessed once to complete the results. Mowing increased soil microbial biomass and carbon use efficiency, which supported carbon sequestration in soil. In contrast, mulching led to a decrease in microbial biomass and microbial metabolic efficiency due to the limitation of easily decomposable carbon. This was a consequence of changes in temperature and light conditions under the mulch layer, which suppressed plant growth and rhizodeposition. Processes causing organic matter transformation in the mulched grassland were similar to those of the untreated grassland. Annual mowing appears to be most suitable for maintenance of SOM content and sustainability of montane grasslands. (C) 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The following article provides an overview of issues related to international cooperation and water use in the Eastern Nile Basin, thereby introducing the following three papers written from an Ethiopian, Sudanese and Egyptian perspective respectively. Basic environmental and socio-economic data is given. The various national interests and international initiatives in the Nile Basin are introduced. Key areas of consensus between the authors, as well as open questions that still need to be worked on, are elaborated. The article also describes the unique process of how the six authors from three countries worked on this joint publication in the Nile Dialogue Workshop of 2002. Key conclusions are that sustained, non-polemical communication can lead to cooperation, and that cooperation is the cornerstone to sustainable water development.

AB In Canada's Northwest Territories, governments, industrial corporations, and other organizations have tried many strategies to promote the meaningful consideration of traditional knowledge in environmental decision making, acknowledging that such consideration can foster more socially egalitarian and environmentally sustainable relationships between human societies and Nature. These initiatives have taken the form of both "top-down" strategies (preparing environmental governance authorities to receive traditional knowledge) and "bottom-up" strategies (fostering the capacity of aboriginal people to bring traditional knowledge to bear in environmental decision making). Unfortunately, most of these strategies have had only marginally beneficial effects, primarily because they failed to overcome certain significant barriers. These include communication barriers, arising from the different languages and styles of expression used by traditional knowledge holders; conceptual barriers, stemming from the organizations' difficulties in comprehending the values, practices, and context underlying traditional knowledge; and political barriers, resulting from an unwillingness to acknowledge traditional-knowledge messages that may conflict with the agendas of government or industry. Still other barriers emanate from the co-opting of traditional knowledge by non-aboriginal researchers and their institutions. These barriers help maintain a power imbalance between the practitioners of science and European-style environmental governance and the aboriginal people and their traditional knowledge. This imbalance fosters the rejection of traditional knowledge or its transformation and assimilation into Euro-Canadian ways of knowing and doing.

AB Although the introduced neem tree Azadirachta inclica A. Juss is a very important energy source in the coastal savanna of Ghana, the sustainability of small-scale wood harvesting (SSWH) has not been investigated with regard to this species. This paper assesses the sustainability of SSWH on neem stands in the coastal savanna, using a socio-economic and ecological survey. The results show that SSWH, incorporating coppicing, stand tolerance, balanced with total bole cutting and root removal, and based on socio-cultural supports, has created a modified yet sustainable system of SSWH. It is concluded that these systems may contribute to tree stand conservation.

AB Within the frame of the ESCOMPTE program, a spatial emission inventory and an emission database aimed at tropospheric photochemistry intercomparison modeling has been developed under the scientific supervision of the LPCA with the help of the regional coordination of Air Quality network AIRMARAIX This inventory has been established for all categories of sources (stationary, mobile and biogenic sources) over a domain of 19,600 km(2) centered on the cities of Marseilles-Aix-en-Provence in the southeastern part of France with a spatial resolution of 1 km(2). A yearly inventory for 1999 has been established, and hourly emission inventories for 23 days of June and July 2000 and 2001, corresponding to the intensive measurement periods, have been produced. The 104 chemical species in the inventory have been selected to be relevant with respect to photochemistry modeling according to available data. The entire list of species in the inventory numbers 216 which will allow other future applications of this database. This database is presently the most detailed and complete regional emission database in France. In addition, the database structure and the emission calculation modules have been designed to ensure a better sustainability and upgradeability, being provided with appropriate maintenance software. The general organization and method is summarized and the results obtained for both yearly and hourly emissions are detailed and discussed. Some comparisons have been performed with the existing results in this region to ensure the congruency of the results. This leads to confirm the relevance and the consistency of the ESCOMPTE emission inventory. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   speech pathology
AB Objective: The literature suggests that approximately 90% of residents in aged care facilities have communication difficulties and between 40 and 60% of residents experience dysphasia. The ability of residents to attend outpatient clinics or private consultation, especially in a rural setting, is severely restricted. In an attempt to address this service gap a speech pathology service for residents in rural aged care facilities was developed and trialed over a 12-month period.
   Method: Thirty aged care facilities in the Northern Rivers Area of New South Wales (NSW) agreed to participate in the trial.
   Results and Conclusion: An analysis of the first 9 months of data collected showed 331 resident consultations, 94 general practitioner (GP) consultations, and 111 education sessions showed that the quality of life of residents was greatly improved. As well, the skills, knowledge and the overall provision of service provided by GPs, nursing and allied health staff to residents of aged care facilities was greatly enhanced. The speech pathology service also proved to be financially self-sustainable and was able to generate income for: (i) GPs through improved access to Enhanced Primary Care (EPC) funding; and (ii) aged care facilities through significant movements within the Resident Classification Scale.

AB Many ecological theories are based on the concept of patches. Patches are a useful starting point for conservation efforts, but a focus on patches alone will not always achieve desired conservation outcomes. Conservation strategies in the grazing landscapes of southeastern Australia suggest that large patches of trees are widely regarded as 'habitat' while other forms of habitat are largely ignored. We provide data on birds and reptiles from the Nanangroe grazing landscape that illustrate the potential habitat value of areas located between large patches of trees that is, the matrix. Despite evidence on its potential value, present conservation strategies rarely consider the matrix. Possible reasons for this bias relate to the economics of farming and the history of land use, the current environmental law framework, and also the reluctance of ecologists to study the matrix. More scientific evidence on the role of the matrix will be crucial if conservation strategies are to consider not only patches, but entire landscapes. However, for science to be relevant to land management, there is a need for new research approaches. First, an increased consideration of environmental policy and law will increase the likelihood of scientific findings being adopted by policy makers. Second, at an applied level, more practical on-ground research into farming practices and clearer communication are necessary to achieve more sustainable matrix management in Australian grazing landscapes.

AB Does ecotourism contribute towards conservation of threatened species and habitats or is it just a marketing ploy of the tourism industry? Using 251 case studies on ecotourism from the literature, I looked at the distribution of case studies over continents, habitats and flagship species types and what factors influenced whether an ecotourism regime was perceived as ecologically sustainable by authors. Over 50% of ecotourism case studies were reported from Africa and Central America. The overall distribution of ecotourism case studies did not reflect vertebrate endemism, nor overall tourism distribution in terms of tourist numbers and receipts. There were significant differences between continents and habitats with regard to the proportion of sustainable case studies: ecotourism is perceived to be less sustainable in South America and Asia, and in island and mountain habitats. The type of flagship species also influenced whether ecotourism was classified as sustainable or not: ecotourism with no flagship species was rarely classified as sustainable while charismatic bird and mammal species were associated with a higher probability of sustainability. In a multivariate analysis, flagship species type and local community involvement were important predictors of sustainability in ecotourism. Detailed a priori planning, local involvement and control measures were perceived by authors of case studies to increase the success of ecotourism in conservation. They also perceived that ecotourism can only be an effective conservation tool under certain conditions. If these are met, the evidence indicates that ecotourism can make a contribution to conservation.

AB Great crested newts (Triturus cristatus) are protected under European and UK legislation, but are frequently the subject of conflict between development and conservation in England. When this occurs, the developer is legally obliged to instigate a mitigation plan to reduce the impacts on the newts. This usually involves the translocation of newts coupled with habitat enhancement and creation. We reviewed mitigation projects carried out in England between 1990 and 2001 by (1) analysing licensing information collected by the governmental licensing authorities; and (2) a questionnaire survey of a sample of mitigation projects. Over half of the licensed projects on file contained no report of the work undertaken. There was an increase in the number of new translocation projects from less than 10 a year in the early 1990s to over 80 a year by 2000. This translates into about 1.5 million per year currently being spent on grew: crested newt mitigation projects. Most of these projects involved in situ translocations of newts to areas within or adjacent to the development site. The number of newts translocated per project declined over the same period, and was related to the total area of habitat destroyed and work effort. About 27% of great crested newt terrestrial habitat was destroyed during the developments along with about half of all ponds. Although the number of new ponds created compensated for the number of known great crested newt ponds lost, there was a net loss in terms of overall area of aquatic habitat. Where follow-up monitoring of translocations was conducted, there was evidence of breeding at most sites one-year post-development, but it is unclear whether these populations were sustainable in the long-term.

AB The Eurasian woodcock Scolopax rusticola is a migratory bird of major importance for hunting, which is susceptible to habitat loss and the stochastic effects of severe winter weather. Conservation issues mostly concerned regulation of hunting, but the efficiency of hunting-free reserves has never been investigated. We studied causes of mortality and survival probabilities of 98 radio-tagged woodcocks in a reserve with no hunting and in an adjoining hunting area in Brittany (France). Predation, mostly by mammalian predators on fields at night, was similar among adults and yearlings, while hunting mortality was more important in yearlings. Overall winter survival probabilities were 0.86 +/- SE 0.07 in adults and 0.63 +/- SE 0.07 in yearlings. Survival probabilities of both age classes increased as birds spent more time in the reserve. Equality of predation in both reserve and hunting areas suggests an additive mortality due to hunting over the winter. Population matrix models predicted that such low survival probabilities cannot sustain long term viable populations. These results call for caution in the harvesting of woodcock populations wintering in western France and could be a forewarning of a decline. The regulation of hunting by setting bag limits or reducing the length of shooting seasons, or the creation of reserves might be appropriate tools for the sustainable management of woodcock populations.

AB Amphibians and reptiles are taken from the wild and sold commercially as food, pets, and traditional medicines. The overcollecting of some species highlights the need to assess the trade and ensure that it is not contributing to declines in wild populations. Unlike most countries, the United States tracks the imports and exports of all amphibians and reptiles. Records from 1998 to 2002 reveal a US trade of several million wild-caught amphibians and reptiles each year, although many shipments are not recorded at the species level. The magnitude and content of the global commercial trade carries even greater unknowns. The absence of accurate trade and biological information for most species makes it difficult to establish whether current take levels are sustainable. The void of information also implies that population declines due to overcollecting could be going undetected. Policy changes to acquire baseline biological information and ensure a sustainable trade are urgently needed.

AB We studied the impact of hunting on monkey species in the Tai National Park and adjacent forests in Cote d'Ivoire. The average wild meat consumption per capita per year was assessed from market surveys and interviews. We determined that the amount of primate wild meat being extracted in the Tai National Park and surrounding forests was 249 t in 1999. Hunting pressure was the highest on the larger primate species such as red colobus, Procolobus badius, and white colobus, Colobus polykomos, and the sooty mangabey, Cercocebus torquatus atys. Estimates of population densities were based on line transect surveys. The maximum annual production of each species was calculated using the Robinson and Redford model (1991) and assuming unhunted conditions. Comparing current harvest levels with the maximum sustainable yield suggests that harvest of red colobus monkeys (Procolobus badius) is sustainable, whereas current off-take of the black and white colobus (Colobus polykomos), the sooty mangabey (Cercocebus atys), diana monkeys (Cercopithecus diana), and Campbell's monkeys (Cercopithecus campbelli) exceeds sustainability by up to three times.

AB The urgent global objective of developing sustainable tropical forestry management practices, which also target biodiversity conservation, requires rapid comparative studies that address both biogeography and logging practices. This paper examines avifaunal implications (focusing on species diversity and composition) of forest fragmentation and selective logging, by comparing 15 selected reserved forests in south-west Ghana. The regeneration time since last logging varied from 0 (logging continuing) to 21 years, with one unlogged site as control. Extraction levels ranged between 0.20 and 3-75 trees per ha (mean 0.90). Bird sampling involved understorey mist-netting and standardized line-transect walks, which respectively accumulated 8,348 captures and 22,452 single records Of 147 species. Mist-net data showed that understorey bird diversity was positively correlated with logging intensity up to c. 3 trees per ha, reflecting increased influx of open-land species and a persistence of forest obligates during the first 5 years after logging. The overall abundance of forest interior species tended to decrease 5-10 years after logging, but recovered fairly well thereafter. Canopy birds were generally more logging-resilient. Rare forest obligates with high conservation importance were found to be equally abundant in virgin and logged, large forests, whereas these birds were poorly represented in small heavily logged forests. The results are compared with findings from other regions, and conservation implications and constraints are discussed in a global perspective. Finally, recommendations on size-related sustainable extraction levels and regeneration time are presented for the Upper Guinea Forest.

AB The realisation that much of conventional. modern architecture is not sustainable over the long term is not new. Typical approaches are aimed at using energy and materials more efficiently. However, by clearly understanding the natural processes and their interactions with human needs in view, designers can create buildings that are delightful. functional productive and regenerative by design. The paper aims to review the biomimetics literature that is relevant to building materials and design. Biomimetics is the abstraction of good design from Nature, an enabling interdisciplinary science. particularly interested in emerging properties of materials and structures as a result of their hierarchical organisation. Biomimetics provides ideas relevant to: graded functionality of materials (nano-scale), adaptive response (nano-, micro-. and macro-scales): integrated intelligence (sensing and actuation at all scales), architecture and additional functionality. There are many examples in biology where emergent response of plants and animals to temperature, humidity and other changes in their physical environments is based on relatively simple physical principles. However, the implementation of design solutions which exploit these principles is where inspiration for man-made structures should be. We analyse specific examples of sustainability from Nature and the benefits or value that these solutions have brought to different creatures. By doing this, we appreciate how the natural world fits into the world of sustainable buildings and how as building engineers we can value its true application in delivering sustainable building.

   agent theory; property markets; sustainability; Germany
AB As housing and commercial property markets shift from predominantly supply-push to demand-pull in some parts of Western Europe, consumers will place greater value on information regarding a building's degree of quality and performance. However, information asymmetries in present markets indicate the supply side fails to meet the building information needs of the demand side about the quality, performance and service provided by a facility. Therefore, when property is traded, the demand side's willingness to pay for value decreases and the initial price becomes the decisive factor. The question is raised whether the quality or the performance approach might stimulate the market to provide sufficient building information to counter asymmetric information. It is argued that both concepts are moving towards one another, that they are complementary and that they can form the basis of an interchanging communication medium. A comprehensive building information system is proposed that serves as a knowledge basis from which certain building information can be extracted depending on the type of enquiry. An array of indicators and criteria is categorized to allocate/match information on buildings to the parties involved. It is argued that creating an effective information exchange between market participants leads to a 'win-win' situation for the demand and supply sides in particular and for the whole construction and property industry in general. The details of this paper are related to housing property markets.

ID MANAGEMENT; UNCERTAINTY; ADVOCACY
AB During the last 50 yrs (at least), fishery science and fisheries management have undergone a long process of co-evolution with periods of crisis in their relationship with society. The current one, following the last resources collapse and public recognition of the high failure rate of conventional management, is therefore not new but, once again, it questions the role and responsibility of fisheries science. This relationship is blotted with issues regarding the specific role of science in promoting sustainability; the use of science in decision-making or in advocacy; the science and management crisis; the relationship between crises and institutional evolution; the ongoing trend from consensus to polarization and litigation; the quality and problems of communication; the cost and affordability of science; the lack of clear management objectives; and the use of traditional knowledge. Fishery science is facing three new concepts which, while having significant scientific requirements, originate from the general societal debate on environmental conservation, uncertainty, and societal risks. These pose new challenges to fishery science in its contribution to the implementation of the precautionary approach, the development of sustainable development reference systems (SDRSs) with indicators and reference points, and the scientific basis for ecosystem-based fisheries management. Structuring the research framework, these related or nested concepts lay the basis for a much more broadly based scientific approach to development and management, as well as improved decision-making. They also require scientists to better understand their role and that of the other stakeholders and society in decision-making in a holistic and uncertain context.

ID TROPHIC LEVELS; FISHERIES; ECOSYSTEMS
AB The widespread call for a transition toward "ecosystem-based" fisheries management implies the development and testing of sustainability indicators suitable for inferences on the status of the ecosystems within which fisheries resource species are embedded. The mean trophic level (TL) of fisheries catches has been shown to allow for such inferences, leading in the process to the identification of global trends toward catches being increasingly dominated by low-TL species, a process now known as "fishing down marine food webs." However, for inferences from TL trends to be accurate, taxonomic and especially geographic over-aggregation of the underlying catch data must be avoided. Accounting for these strong sources of bias suggests that the fishing down effect is far more pervasive than previously thought, and in fact occurs in areas where initial analyses failed to detect it. This confirms the common verdict of absent sustainability for most fisheries of the world. This is illustrated here by five brief case studies, of which three also document a new method for estimating ecosystem transfer efficiency, under a set of specific conditions, from time series of catches and their corresponding mean TL. Some suggestions are given on how work in this area might proceed.

AB An intermediate set of fisheries ecosystem models are discussed in terms of the promise they offer for understanding fisheries sustainability. The models are intermediate in the sense that they treat a set of interacting agents that are small enough to allow progress with purely analytical means (n < 5). The models include considerations of food web dynamics and population structure. Here the later is considered to include age and metabolic status, although genetics can also be included. As an example of structure, a nonlinear physiological model for starvation is presented. The metabolically based model produces finite limits of populations in space based on the carrying capacity of the environment. A structured model of the lower part of a marine food web's response to climate fluctuations is discussed as a basis for understanding these influences on marine ecosystem function. This is followed by an analysis of Alaskan Pollock, and an assessment of the adaptive nature of cannibalism in that population. The conclusion is that this behavior only works with spatial/temporal segregation of subpopulations. The Pollock example is followed by a general discussion of movement in fisheries models and its consequences in terms of persistence in populations. This is followed by an example of explicitly including fisheries. An analysis of competition between long-line and purse seine fleets on age structured tuna is presented.

AB The term ecosystem regime shift refers to low frequency, high amplitude variation in marine ecosystems involving changes in community composition, species abundances, and trophic structure. Changes occur in the abundance of both exploited and unexploited populations. Temporally coherent changes often occur in other spatially separated ecosystems. Ecosystem regime shifts are thought to be a response to shifts in the ocean and atmosphere climate and hence are relatively coherent with climate changes. However, the mechanisms responsible for ecosystem regime shifts are not well established. Changes in energy flow from the base of the ecosystem is frequently thought to be responsible, but in some cases climate-induced changes in apex predators also result in top-down responses. For example, regime shifts appeared to have occurred in the North Pacific in 1977 and 1989.

AB Marine reserves are being recommended worldwide as a means of protecting biodiversity and increasing fishery sustainability. This has created a need for policy makers to understand how marine reserves can contribute to sustainable fisheries, relative to other approaches. The contribution of marine reserves to the problem of sustainable fisheries depends on whether they can control catch better than conventional fishery management. Models with sedentary adults indicate the effect of marine reserves on fishing is approximately equivalent to the effect of conventional management. This implies that implementation of marine reserves typically will increase yields only in fisheries with excessive effort. Reserves can produce greater catches than conventional management when spatial heterogeneity and movement dominate. However, that will require knowing movement patterns. Reserves are more robust to the uncertainty in current estimates of abundance and the effects of fishing regulations, but they depend to the same degree on the poorly known level of lifetime reproduction required for sustainability, and on highly uncertain larval dispersal distances. Marine reserves may also provide some unique benefits such as maintenance of quasi-natural marine ecosystems, reduction of by-catch, reduction of habitat damage, and a potential for managing multi-species fisheries in data poor situations.

AB Common (Merluccius gayi gayi Guichenot, 1848) and southern (Merluccius australis Hutton, 1872) hakes inhabit the central (32 degrees-41 degrees S) and the southern (41 degrees-57 degrees S) regions off the coast of Chile, respectively. Both species support important trawl and longline fisheries. The common hake fishery started in the 1940s, while the southern hake fishery began in 1970s. During the last 10 yrs the abundance of common hake has increased while that of the southern hake has decreased. At present, the common hake stock is fully exploited and the southern hake is overexploited. We review several biological, fishery, and environmental aspects that influence the historical abundance of each hake. Significant differences exist regarding natural mortality, growth rates, and reproductive and feeding dynamics. The timing of the spawning season is similar for both hakes and is synchronized with the increasing turbulence and upwelling. The resilience of each species to exploitation and environmental changes was analyzed relative to their stock-recruitment (S-R) relationships coupled to environmental variables. The common hake exhibits a Ricker-type S-R relationship with clear compensatory processes due to cannibalism, with significant deviations from this model explained by environmental changes The southern hake has an almost linear S-R relationship with little evidence of compensatory components. General additive models (GAM) show that El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events have positive effects on the recruitment of both hake species. Benchmarks consisting of extinction parameters and F-msy were calculated based on S-R relationships and spawning per recruit analysis. Simulations of constant catch and constant exploitation were used to portray the differences in resilience of each species to exploitation relative to the benchmarks. Results indicate that abundance of the common hake is significantly more impacted by environmental conditions while the abundance of the southern hake is controlled by exploitation regimes under a rather low population response due to the almost total lack of compensatory mechanisms in the spawner-recruit relationship.

ID COAST HAKE; DECADE; CATCH; MERLUCCIUS; STOCKS; WEST
AB The predominantly trawl fishery for hake contributes about half the landed value of all of South Africa's commercial fisheries, and is approaching the largest contributor to Namibia's gross domestic product (GDP). Two hake species are taken by these fisheries: shallow-water hake Merluccius capensis Castelnau, 1861 and deep-water hake Merluccius paradoxus Franca, 1960. The present management framework separates the resources into three areas: Namibia and the South African West and South Coasts. Some 30 yrs ago, particularly as a result of rapidly increasing foreign fishing effort over the preceding decade, all of these hake stocks had been severely depleted. We address the question of how successfully sustainable utilization and resource recovery has been achieved since that time. Although there has indeed been some recovery -to a greater extent for the stocks off South Africa- the historical record indicates over-optimistic appraisals of likely recovery rates and sustainable yield levels over this period, and some of the reasons for this are discussed. Certain key assessment questions remain: why is recruitment variability estimated to be so low, natural mortality so high, and why do estimates of stock-recruitment steepness, survey selectivity-at-age and bias in swept-area survey estimates differ so greatly between the stocks? For the most part, total allowable catch (TAC) for these fisheries over the past decade have been set using Operational Management Procedures (OMPs), pre-set rules applied to pre-specified resource monitoring data, where the selection of the procedure to be used is based upon simulation testing to ensure adequate robustness to uncertainties in data and model-structure, in the spirit of a precautionary approach. We discuss the ability in practice of this approach to achieve the necessary adaptive framework for management and summarize planned future initiatives towards refining this OMP approach. These include changing from the present species-aggregated to separate procedures for M. capensis and M. paradoxus. This is necessitated particularly by an increasing longline component in the South African hake fishery, which focuses on M. capensis and takes mainly 6+ aged fish, compared to the mainly 3+ by the trawlers.

AB Alaska Pollock is the largest component of white-fish production worldwide representing about 45% of all white fish. The portion of Pollock caught within U.S. waters has been stable, averaging around 1.2 million t over the last two decades. The condition of the eastern Bering Sea (EBS) pollock stock in 2001 appears to be quite healthy with biomass levels estimated to be around 10 million It. These estimates have a relatively large degree of uncertainty, even though fishery monitoring and survey efforts for this stock are extensive. Part of this uncertainty can be attributed to variable stock dynamics, including spatial variability due to environmental conditions and demographic variability such as pre-recruit survival, natural mortality, and growth. At some point, improving observations on current stock conditions give diminishing returns on improving forecast abundance. Long-term projections illustrate that, given the level of observed recruitment variability, stock biomass levels can vary quite widely, even under little or no fishing. So, how has the pollock fishery become sustainable? In part, early decisions to closely regulate fishing (using truly effective quotas and hence effort rationalization) have led to a successful and so far, sustainable fishery. In addition, an overall cap on total groundfish removals (2 million mt) from the EBS ecosystem has limited individual stock quotas and hence led to a stabilized fishery well within the bounds of sound conservation principals. The combination of effective management regimes together with a rationally developed fishery appear to be ideal for sustaining the Alaskan Pollock resource and fisheries.

   FECUNDITY; SIZE; POPULATION
AB Orange roughy (Hoplostethus atlanticus Collett, 1889) is a deepwater (500-1500 m) demersal species with an almost global distribution. Its exploitation is most developed in New Zealand waters, where it was first caught commercially (in 1979), and where catches peaked at 57,000 t in 1989 but are now about 15,000 t. Most fisheries in these waters have now passed the "fishdown" phase and catch quotas have been set at levels estimated to be sustainable. However, how sustainable orange roughy fisheries can be is still an open question. Three factors that inhibit sustainability are the species' low productivity, ease of capture, and high value. Measures that would help to enhance sustainability include better information about recruitment (particularly the location and abundance of pre-recruits) and, in New Zealand, longer-term management decision making.

AB The Atlantic bluefin tuna Thunnus thynnus (Linnaeus, 1758) has been continually exploited in the Mediterranean Sea since antiquity, but it has recently become highly profitable with the decisive development of the sushi-sashimi market in Japan. Consequently, there was (and still is) a sharp increase in the efficiency of long-established fisheries together with the rapid emergence of new fisheries. As a result, the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean bluefin tuna stock is likely to be overexploited and overfished as it currently suffers the highest fishing pressure of its entire history. In addition, the recent implementation of a Total Allowable Catch (TAC) has induced increasing uncertainties in the catch and effort data and made the standard stock assessment inoperative. Therefore, the main challenge for the conservation of this stock has become more political than scientific. Such a situation is particularly worrisome since their life history traits make the Atlantic bluefin tuna more vulnerable to exploitation than other tuna species. Furthermore, the population dynamics of Atlantic bluefin tuna is complex and analyses of historical data (going back to the 16(th) century) have indicated the occurrence of long-term fluctuations in abundance and/or availability to fishing. Such a feature questions some of the current management rules.

AB The Atlantic bluefin tuna, Thunnus thynnus (Linnaeus, 1758), is one of the most valuable animals in the world. Weighing as much as 700 kg and able to swim at over 90 km h(-1), it is regarded by many as the consummate game fish. It is also highly esteemed among connoisseurs of sashimi, particularly in Japan where one 200 kg specimen recently commanded almost US$174,000. Not surprisingly, the bluefin tuna population in the western Atlantic has declined to a fifth of its former biomass, yet the fisheries for it remain lucrative. Some see this as a recipe for disaster reminiscent of elephant ivory and rhinoceros horns -but others see only a resilient species temporarily stymied by poor environmental conditions. Still others say the bluefin caught in the western Atlantic are part of a much larger pan-Atlantic stock and that the real problem is unregulated fishing in the eastern Atlantic. This paper discusses these and other contentious issues that govern the "sustainability" of western Atlantic bluefin tuna in today's unquenchable markets. It also examines how new technologies are being used to unveil the mysteries that for decades have enshrouded bluefin management policies in controversy.

AB Small pelagic fish contribute up to 50% of the total landing of marine species. They are most abundant in upwelling areas and contribute to food security. Exploited stocks of these species are prone to large interannual and interdecadal variation of abundance as well as to collapse. We discuss why small pelagic fish and fisheries are so "special" with regard to their biology, ecology, and behavior. Two adjectives can sum up the characteristics of pelagic species: variability and instability. Analyses of the relationships between small pelagic fish and their physical environment at different time-scales illustrate the complexity of the interplay between exploitation and environmental impacts. How small pelagic fish species are positioned and related within the trophic web suggests that these species play a central role in the functioning and dynamics of upwelling ecosystems. Finally, we discuss the sustainable exploitation of small pelagic fisheries through appropriate management, focusing on the resilience to exploitation, a comparison of different management options and regulatory mechanisms. We recommend that statistical, socio-economical, and political merits of a proposed two-level (short- and long-term) management strategy be undertaken.

ID PANULIRUS-CYGNUS GEORGE; FISHING EFFORT; STOCK; RECRUITMENT; AUSTRALIA;
   SEA; GROWTH
AB The western rock (spiny) lobster (Panulirus cygnus George, 1962) fishery has 594 boats operating about 57,000 pots. The average annual catch of 11,000 t is valued at around US$150 million. In addition to the commercial catch, recreational fishers take about 600 t yr(-1). Sustainability in this fishery is maintained by analysis of a comprehensive fisheries database, some of which dates back to the 1960s (e.g., catch, effort, length-frequencies, fishery-independent breeding-stock surveys, puerulus settlement monitoring, recreational catch monitoring); an extensive set of management controls (including a limited fishing season and legal minimum and maximum sizes); and an effective compliance program. Effort in the fishery is controlled by input restrictions on the number of pots allowed and number of days fishing, which are implemented after considerable consultation with industry. The principal method of ensuring the sustainability of the fishery is monitoring of the size of the breeding stock, using data from both a commercial at-sea monitoring program and an annual fishery-independent breeding-stock survey. When the breeding stock fell to low levels in the early 1990s, management initiatives succeeded in returning it to what are considered to be safe levels. Catches are currently high, but fishers have acquired sufficient scientific knowledge to understand that catches will fluctuate for environmental reasons and to take this into account in their fishing operations. Environmental effects have been shown to drive the level of settlement in a particular season. These settlement levels are in turn highly correlated with catches 3-4 yrs later, which provides a means of predicting future catches and managing the fishery accordingly. There are issues to consider in assessing the sustainability of this fishery in the future. The fishery may be overly reliant on egg production from the Abrolhos Islands; catching power of the commercial fleet is increasing due to improvements in gear and technological equipment; growth in catches made by the recreational sector are currently unconstrained; pueruli may be harvested for aquaculture in the near future; and regulations protecting the female brood stock more than the male population could lead to reproductive issues. These potential threats are considered to be low, but will need to be monitored. The fishery was awarded Marine Stewardship Council certification in March 2000, the first in the world to receive this imprimatur.

AB Spiny lobster, Panulirus argus (Latreille, 1804), inhabits the western central Atlantic from northeastern Brazil to Bermuda, including the Caribbean Sea. Within this distribution range, the species supports fisheries of great economic importance, reaching over US$456 million to fishers per year. The Pan-Caribbean origin of the recruitment to the fisheries was postulated in the early 1980s under the assumption that larval and puerulus stages are resident in the pelagic environment for up to 9 mo or more and that persistent ocean currents prevailing throughout the region facilitate population dispersal. Genetic studies in the late 1990s provided further evidence of the homogeneity of spiny lobster populations from Brazil to Bermuda. Recruitment mechanisms of some of these populations and their contributions and linkages to local populations point to the likelihood of common population dynamics of P. argus in the western central Atlantic. Considerable associations are shown between production functions throughout the fisheries as well as generic catchability patterns that are used in bio-economic models to portray the intense levels of exploitation of this important regional resource. There is a great similarity in the approach and action of conservation measures throughout the region. Sustainability criteria for the species are drawn based on the findings of regional analyses.

ID INTERTIDAL ZONE; HUMAN-EXCLUSION; CENTRAL CHILE; MANAGEMENT;
   COMANAGEMENT
AB Many artisanal fisheries along coastal zones all over the world belong to the "S" type: small-scale, spatially-structured, targeting sedentary stocks ["S" is derived from the number of times that the letter s appears in their characteristic features]. They contrast sharply with the offshore industrial, centralized fisheries targeting one to few highly mobile species, around which the classical theory has been developed. Stocks targeted by S-fisheries are spatially structured as metapopulations of localized subpopulations typically interconnected through larval dispersal; population dynamics are dominated by spatial heterogeneity and the effects of fishing events are localized. The S-fisheries, which support the livelihood of hundreds of thousands of fishers and their families worldwide, are often regarded as a nightmare from the viewpoint of stock assessment, and ultimately as unmanageable. Fundamental difficulties stem from the fact that: (1) the effectiveness of catch and effort controls at the global scale is questionable, and (2) where thousands of fishers land the catch anywhere along the coast, accountability and enforcement are simply impossible. All together, this means that centralized monitoring, assessment, and control of these fisheries are unrealistic propositions. Sustainability is made possible only by providing the right incentives for the fishers (and other stakeholders) to participate in all stages of management (monitoring, analysis of the information, decision-making, and enforcement), and to behave according to societal expectations. These points are illustrated with co-management initiatives involving three commercial diving fisheries that target stocks of benthic invertebrates around South America: loco snails in central and northern Chile, sea urchins in southern Chile, and scallops in Argentine Patagonia, all of which underwent severe crises during the 1990s, prompting the search for alternatives.

AB Global production of Haliotids (abalone) declined more than 60% since the 1960s and continues to decline, indicating a failure to manage these resources sustainably. This paper discusses facets of abalone biology which make sustainable management problematic. Abalone resources are comprised of many small (100s-1000s in) self-recruiting microstocks with highly variable sizes-at-maturity. This causes a mismatch between the scale of management and the scale of component units of stock. This "tyranny of scale" leaves component microstocks vulnerable to the "tragedy of the commons" and resources vulnerable to serial depletion despite apparently rigorous regional scale management. I postulate that beyond abalone, and across a range of spatial scales, unrecognized spatial complexity compromises monitoring, assessment, and management in many fisheries. I suggest that a major challenge for abalone fisheries and the field of fisheries more generally, is to adapt the scale of fisheries monitoring, assessment, and management to the actual scale of component units of stocks, and to mobilize the resources required to adequately address the global needs of a myriad of microstocks. An increased use of territorially based fishing rights and a new class of fisheries practitioners are proposed as part of the answer to this challenge.

AB The southwest Atlantic is home to two important squid fisheries that target species with different life history strategies. Illex argentinus Castellanos, 1960 is an oceanic squid which has a high fecundity and makes long-distance migrations within the Brazil/Falklands western boundary current system. Loligo gahi d'Orbigny, 1835 is a neritic species around the Falkland Islands, which has low fecundity and makes relatively short ontogenetic migrations. However, both have single-year life histories, and populations consisting of multiple cohorts of similarly-aged animals. Fisheries target feeding concentrations of pre-adults and adults. Stock-recruitment relationships for these species are relatively uninformative, although there is evidence that very low stock densities negatively affect recruitment. The stocks are managed using a combination of pre-recruit surveys and in-season depletion-based assessments to meet a target escapement (spawning stock) biomass. Strong links between recruitment and oceanographic parameters have been demonstrated for both species. Sustainability of these, and other, squid stocks is likely to depend on the ability of management to respond to changing environmental conditions, both between years (responding to variable recruitment through in-season management of the single-age cohorts) and over longer periods of time to cope with oceanographic regime shifts.

AB Southern Florida coral reefs generated an estimated 71,000 jobs and US$6 billion in economic activity in 2001. These ecosystem goods and services, however, are threatened by increased exploitation and environmental changes from a rapidly growing regional human population. To address these threats, we adopted an ecosystem-based perspective and developed a systems science analysis framework over the last decade to better assess and improve sustainable multispecies reef fisheries in the Florida Keys. Here we describe our progress and provide three example applications. We first built upon traditional catch and effort stock assessment methodologies by collecting spatially-explicit, fishery-independent data covering all reef fishes and reef habitats in the Keys. An optimized sampling strategy and a new length-based assessment framework provided synoptic spatial estimates of species abundance and size structures. Models were developed that encompassed the complex biological dynamics of fish stocks and a broad range of environmental and human impacts, including fisheries, non-target species, predator-prey interactions, species movements, ontogenetic changes in habitat associations, and physical processes. We show that the snapper-grouper fishery in the Florida Keys is experiencing overfishing and that stocks are overfished relative to established benchmarks for resource sustainability. Spatially explicit models demonstrated the potential effectiveness of no-take marine reserves to support sustainable fisheries, and were employed to objectively evaluate marine reserve boundary options in the Dry Tortugas. We show the importance of considering physical coupling and regional water quality changes resulting from Everglades restoration. A fishery systems science framework improves understanding of impacts from fishery extraction, ecosystem alterations, and natural oceanographic variability on the dynamics of exploited fish stocks.

ID FUTURE
AB The Russian Federation has the eleventh highest tuberculosis burden in the world in terms of the total estimated number of new cases that occur each year. In 2003, 26% of the population was covered by the internationally recommended control strategy known as directly observed treatment (DOT) compared to an overall average of 61% among the 22 countries with the highest burden of tuberculosis.
   The Director-General of WHO has identified two necessary starting points for the scaling-up of interventions to control emerging infectious diseases. These are a comprehensive engagement with the health system and a strengthening of the health system. The success of programmes aimed at controlling infectious diseases is often determined by constraints posed by the health system. We analyse and evaluate the impact of the arrangements. for delivering tuberculosis services in the Russian Federation, drawing on detailed analyses of barriers and incentives created by the organizational structures, and financing and provider-payment systems. We demonstrate that the systems offer few incentives to improve the efficiency of services or the effectiveness of tuberculosis control. Instead, the system encourages prolonged supervision through specialized outpatient departments in hospitals (known as dispensaries), multiple admissions to hospital and lengthy hospitalization.
   The implementation, and expansion and sustainability of WHO-approved methods of tuberculosis control in the Russian Federation are unlikely to be realized under the prevailing system of service delivery. This is because implementation does not take into account the wider context of the health system. In order for the control programme to be sustainable, the health system will need to be changed to enable services to be reconfigured so that incentives are created to reward improvements in efficiency and outcomes.

AB We describe thermal histories for Lake Ontario chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) as determined from otolith delta O-18 thermometry using computer-controlled micromilling techniques to recover otolith aragonite at subseasonal resolution. We find that during the summer months chinook salmon inhabited epilimnetic waters with temperatures of -19-20 degrees C as far back as the late 1980s. Chinook would approach but rarely exceed their reported upper incipient lethal limit of approximately 22 degrees C, which suggests that these fish were seeking water with temperatures as high as was tolerable while otolith growth occurred. These results contrast with expected midsummer temperatures for this cold-water salmonine. Bioenergetic simulations indicate significant stress imposed upon chinook salmon. We estimate consumption to be up to 20% more and gross conversion efficiency 18% less annually relative to nominal simulations where chinook salmon are modeled nearer their preferred temperature, reinforcing previous inferences that the chinook salmon population may be near the limits of sustainability. We also find a strong negative correlation between delta O-18 and delta C-13 values. Therefore, seasonal and ontogenetic variation in delta C-13 values of chinook salmon otoliths appear to be related to metabolic rate during pelagic residence and may provide an indirect method for evaluating field activity and other aspects of fish life history.

ID SPHERE
AB The use of internet technologies, specifically interactive electronic dialogues, has the potential to revive the shrinking Canadian public sphere. Precedent for this assertion can be found in the historical effect of radio technology. The development of Canadian radio forums in the twentieth century Such as the National Farm Radio Forum and the Citizen's Forum provided a crude two way interactive medium that helped to shape collective Canadian norms and values. The internet holds the potential to reintroduce national dialogues and reinvigorate the public sphere at a time when Canadians both need and want to address national issues such as environmental concerns and sustainable development. As such dialogue occurs in a "cyberspace" removed from the limitations of physical geography, internet dialogues allow participants from widely diverse groups to come together, surmounting traditional barriers to interaction. Though the danger exists that internet technologies will be abused to reinforce passive static forms of communication, the potential for highly interactive two way dialogue holds the promise of bringing the public into timely and necessary debates on public policy.

AB Objective: sustained health promotion programmes in the workplace (HPPW) continues to be a public health challenge. This article presents an evaluation of the implementation and sustainability of such programmes in private blue-collar companies in Quebec to shed light on issues specific to this type of setting.
   Method: A multiple case (4 sites), longitudinal (7 years) and interpretive study method was used. The interpretation framework considered that the implementation and sustainability of HPPW in companies are the result of organizational learning in health promotion, determined by the strategies of individuals in a position of control who shape the decisional processes related to these programmes.
   Results: After seven years of observation, two of four sites had continued their HPPW, although these programmes were no longer applied within these companies. The health promotion organizational learning processes in both sites were defined according to targeted organizational purposes set by the decision-makers who supported HPPW. However, these gains were largely lost when HPPW were no longer retained as a component of their organizational development strategy.
   Discussion: The organizational conditions that are conducive to HPPW are difficult to put together and sustain in companies like those in our study. Bussinesses implement these programmes mainly for the organizational benefits they expect to reap in the short term, whereas improvement in the health of workers in the longer term is not a priority.

AB Background: The Rapid Risk Factor Surveillance System (RRFSS) is an ongoing population health survey conducted by a collaborating group of Ontario public health units. This formative evaluation examined the process effectiveness, collaboration, utility and costeffectiveness of RRFSS during its first year of operation.
   Methods: An Evaluation Framework was developed with reference to guidelines for evaluation of surveillance systems developed by the World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The study focussed on evaluable performance areas in a young surveillance system and on information needed to inform stakeholder decisions about future participation and improvement. Data were collected through surveys and interviews of key informants in participating health units, non-participating health units, the survey research house, and the provincial health ministry.
   Results: Findings documented early use and dissemination of RRFSS data in health units after less than a year of surveillance system operation, stakeholder perceptions overall of data impact and value, and satisfaction with system functioning. Challenges to effectiveness were documented concerning data analysis, barriers to data use, and sustainability. Performance improvement strategies were identified for survey implementation and supports, data use, system participation, and reduced costs.
   Conclusion: In its first year, RRFSS was an effective collaborative method to collect population data for public health program planning and evaluation. The evaluation provided valuable information on use, functioning, effectiveness, strategic issues and areas for improvement in a young surveillance system, created opportunities for stakeholder input into evaluation and planning, and provided a baseline for future evaluations.

ID UNITED-STATES; RATES
AB The age-standardized lung cancer incidence rate among women in the United States has decreased for each of the last 3 years for which data are available (1999-2001). We conducted this study to assess the stability and near-term sustainability of this decrease. We examined temporal trends in age-specific lung cancer incidence by calendar year and birth cohort and measured trends in the age-standardized rate in each geographic area within the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program using joinpoint regression analyses. Age-standardized lung cancer incidence rates have peaked or are decreasing in all geographic areas within SEER, although the decline is statistically significant only in San Francisco-Oakland. Age-specific incidence rates are decreasing in six of the seven 5-year age groups between ages 50 and 84 years in all areas of SEER combined. Rates in these age groups contribute nearly 95% of the total age-standardized incidence rate; consequently, trends in incidence at these ages will determine future trends in the overall age-standardized incidence rate for the next 20 to 25 years. Birth cohort patterns suggest that the decrease in the age-standardized rate will continue for at least 20 years, but will be slowed by aging of women born in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Given calendar year and birth cohort age-specific incidence patterns, the early decline in lung cancer incidence among women is likely to persist through at least 2025. Sustaining the downward trend beyond 2025 will require continued reductions in smoking initiation among children and increases in cessation among addicted smokers.

AB A novel nanostructure, heterogeneous Pd-Au nanocontact showing conductance quantization, was fabricated via selective electrochemical deposition of Pd at a gap of two sustainable thin Au wires in solution. The stability of Pd monatomic contact increased when the potential of the electrode was kept at negative potential. Contribution of the adsorbed hydrogen on Pd-Au contact was considered as the origin of the improved stability.

AB In 2000, more than 60 nonprofit agencies, health care providers, government officials, and community advocates in Tarrant County, Texas, came together to work for systemic change in the mental health care system. The coalition, known as the Mental Health Connection, began working toward a "No Wrong Door" approach to mental health services, which required aggressive coordination between federal, private, and nonprofit resources. The result is a five- to six-year plan for implementation of a new systems of care model for children with severe emotional disturbances and their families. The Mental Health Connection also focuses on legislative advocacy to bring about necessary policy changes at the local, state, and federal levels. Finally, the coalition focuses on developing sustainable revenue streams that will allow the new systems to remain in place once the group accomplishes the initial mission of the Mental Health Connection.

TI Health finance in rural henan: Low premium insurance compared to the
   out-of-pocket system
SO CHINA QUARTERLY
LA English
DT Article
ID CHINA
AB China's health reforms of the 1980s led to privatization of rural health care with adverse impact on farmers. A decade later a new rural co-operative medical scheme (RCMS), was piloted throughout many provinces to promote better equity. Although many schemes later collapsed owing to inadequate funding, some continue to the present. This article compares such a scheme with the out-of-pocket system in Henan province. We study the township hospitals, focusing on cost of services, utilization rates and impact of RCMS on hospitals' financial sustainability. Our results derive from monthly hospital records and a survey of four hospitals in two adjacent counties, one county with low-premium RCMS and the other with the out-of-pocket system.
   All hospitals charged for preventive activities (such as antenatal care, immunization), an unfortunate consequence of limited government support. It was not clear that on average, the total cost of individual patient visits in RCMS hospitals was lower than non-RCMS hospitals. Farmers were generally unaware of their insurance entitlements, except the catastrophic illnesses for which there was a real benefit from refund of US$100 or more. Although the effect of the RCMS on hospital charges was unclear it was notable that the utilization rates in RCMS areas were twice those in non-RCMS.
   We conclude that RCMS hospitals were better funded because of re-imbursements from the insurance scheme and therefore were more viable as sources of good health care. Thus, health care could become more equitable under RCMS than the out-of-pocket system. China is now beginning to test a revised form of RCMS with pooling at the county level, increased premiums (10 yuan per person) and increased government funding. However, it must be followed closely to determine the effect on rural services and health care costs for farmers.

AB Ecological security is a vital problem that people all over the world today have to face and solve, and the situation of ecological security is getting more and more severe and has begun to impede heavily the sustainable development of social economy. Ecological environment pre-warning has become a hotspot for the modern environment science. This paper introduces the theories of ecological security pre-warning and tries to constitute a pre-warning model of ecological security. In terms of pressure-state-response model, the pre-warning guide line of ecological security is constructed while the pre-warning degree judging model of ecological security is established based on fuzzy optimization. As a case, the model is used to assess the present condition pre-warning of the ecological security of Anhui Province. The result is in correspondence with the real condition: the ecological security situations of 8 cities are dangerous and 9 cities are secure. The result shows that this model is scientific and effective for regional ecological security pre-warning.

AB Composting inside high-rise, caged layer facilities can produce atmospheric ammonia (NH3) concentrations exceeding standards for human and poultry health. Control measures that reduce NH3 volatilization are necessary for in-house composting to be sustainable. Due to differences specific to in-house composting - low carbon to nitrogen ratios of composting material, continuous manure addition, and frequent turning - it is not known whether NH3 control measures used previously for poultry manure will work. The objectives of this study were to evaluate various amendment and process controls on NH3 produced during simulated in-house composting in the lab, and to evaluate select chemical control measures during composting inside a high-rise layer facility. Ten amendments (aluminum sulfate; chloride salts of aluminum, calcium, magnesium, and potassium; gypsum; sodium bisulfate; zeolite (clinoptilolite); straw; and cellulose) and four process controls (moisture; temperature; turning frequency; and particle size) were evaluated in lab incubations in 1 L vessels wherein samples of poultry manure compost were incubated to simulate composting. Vials of boric acid solution were used to capture NH3 evolved during incubations. With the exception of zeolite and cellulose, all amendments reduced NH3 capture. Low moisture and temperature also reduced NH3 capture, although managing temperature and moisture to achieve low NH3 would adversely impact microbial activity and other desired benefits of composting. When evaluated inhouse, aluminum sulfate, calcium chloride and magnesium chloride did not reduce NH3 evolution from compost measured on three different dates with a gas sensor. Spatial variability along treated segments of windrow apparently masked amendment effects. At the end of a six-week composting cycle, total nitrogen content was higher in compost treated with aluminum sulfate than control or chloride salt treatments. Aluminum sulfate and process controls such as moisture content, carbon source and particle size have potential to reduce NH3 loss from poultry manure composted inside high-rise layer structures. In-house compost management to reduce NH3 volatilization must consider the cost of amendments, effectiveness, and impacts on the composting process.

AB Over a period of 10 years the Hospital Authority has developed an integrated clinical information system (The Clinical Management System-CMS), including a territory-wide longitudinal electronic patient record (ePR). The CMS and ePR are used by over 4000 doctors and 20,000 other clinicians to document and review care. The ePR currently has nearly 3TB of data covering 44 million episodes for 6.4 million patients. To date the CMS has largely dealt with textual data. However, PACs technology is increasingly being adopted in the HA. This paper describes our strategy for taking the hospital image archives and making them available throughout the Authority as part of the longitudinal patient record, leveraging the ePR to distribute radiological and other images in a manner which is integrated, affordable and sustainable.

ID RICE FARMERS
AB Farmers in Northern China were interviewed during the 2002 season concerning their knowledge, perceptions and practices on Bt cotton. Farmers have some awareness of insect pests in Bt cotton, especially on the resurgence of sucking pests such as red spider mites and aphids, but 60% of farmers overestimated damage by Helicoverpa armigera, the cotton bollworm in Bt cotton. Farmers' knowledge was very poor on the identification of diseases and natural enemies of pests in cotton. Farmers' knowledge and perceptions of Bt cotton were not significantly associated with their gender or formal education. All the farmers in the survey had adopted Bt cotton during the 5-year period since seed became commercially available in 1997. Their reasons for adoption were either; to save labour, to reduce pesticide applications, to obtain higher yields or to make cotton growing more profitable. Farmers used more than 7 varieties of Bt cotton and 29% of the seed used was home-retained. Pesticide was sprayed intensively on Bt cotton with an average of 12.7 applications per season. The results indicate that farmers were still over-utilising pesticides in the control of pests in Bt cotton. Farmers in small producer cotton systems need further training in the identification of pests, natural enemies, basic ecology and integrated pest management strategies to ensure sustainable production of Bt cotton.

ID COASTAL BERMUDAGRASS; ELEMENT REMOVAL; YIELD; QUALITY; MANURE
AB Application of livestock manure to crop lands is one method of recycling nutrients. An experiment was conducted to determine the effect of applying solid cattle (Bos spp.) manure (SCM), liquid swine (Sus spp.) effluent (LSE), or commercial fertilizer (CF; urea) at three application rates (0, 120, or 240 kg N ha(-1)) on the yield, plant canopy height, and nutritive value (crude protein, CP; and in vitro organic matter digestibility, IVOMD) of buffalograss [Buchloe dactyloides (Nutt.) Engelm.] forage grown with irrigation during a 4-yr period. Two forage harvests were made in each of four growing seasons, and canopy height was measured before each harvest. For all N sources, seasonal dry matter yield (DMY), canopy height, and CP increased as N rate increased during each of the 3 yr following establishment. However, as the buffalograss stand aged, the yield, canopy height, and nutritive value of forage declined. Given the availability of livestock manure in the High Plains region of the USA and the need to recycle this by-product from confined animal feeding operations, the application of livestock manure to buffalograss grown with irrigation for hay or pasture could be a viable and sustainable production system. Future work should address the long-term effects of applying livestock manure to soils in relation to nutrient loading and water quality.

TI Spontaneous precipitation of struvite from synthetic wastewater

SO CRYSTAL GROWTH & DESIGN

DT Article
ID PHOSPHORUS
AB Phosphorus recovery from wastewater by precipitation in the form of crystalline struvite is an attractive option contributing toward sustainable development. Struvite or magnesium ammonium phosphate hexahydrate (MgNH4PO4 center dot 6H(2)O) is a crystalline salt, which may be used either as a fertilizer or as raw material for the production of phosphorus. The supersaturation of wastewater with respect to the target mineral is the key parameter determining the extent and the rate of recovery, of struvite. In the present work, we investigated the stability domain of struvite in synthetic wastewater (SWW) And report on the kinetics of precipitation of the respective salt forming spontaneously. The investigation was carried out in aqueous solutions with compositions typically encountered in municipal wastewaters. The supersaturation with respect to struvite was varied through the appropriate variation of the concentrations of the Mg2+, NH4+, and PO43- ions, for which the stoichiometric molar ratio of 1:1:1 was observed. All experiments were done at 25 degrees C and at a constant solution pH 8.50 in a stirred batch reactor closed to the atmosphere. The component salt concentrations were selected so that the respective supersaturated solutions were not stable. Precipitation of struvite from the supersaturated solutions prepared in SWW was initiated spontaneously past the lapse of well-defined induction times. The measurements of the induction times showed that the stability range of the supersaturated solutions in SWW was very narrow. The induction times, preceding the formation of struvite, were inversely proportional to the solution supersaturation and followed the dependence predicted by the classical nucleation theory. It was, thus possible to calculate a surface energy of 15 mJ m(-2) for the struvite nuclei forming. The rates of the struvite precipitating past the end of the induction period were measured at a constant driving force by the addition of stoichiometric titrant solutions throughout the precipitation process, using solution pH as a master variable monitored. by a glass electrode sensor. The rates of precipitation measured from the titrants addition showed a parabolic dependence on the solution supersaturation. The high order (> 1) of dependence of the rates on the solution supersaturation suggested a surface diffusion-controlled mechanism.

DE cattle exploitation; ecosystem; efficiency sustainability
AB Due to the importance of the recovery and sustainability of cattle rearing systems, it is necessary the integral systematic analysis of their exploitation efficiency. The analysis should include biological and economical aspects, considering as priority the performance dynamics.. that is, it should not only take into account the short-term results.. which may not be trustworthy. In this paper, some aspects are discussed such as those related to the need of conducting samplings to estimate pastures availability and the calculation of the grazing pressure that expresses the closest relationship between the animal and the herbage. The physiological curve or cycle of the plant growth is shown, as well as the need to know the annual herbage growth curve, that, together with the botanical composition, will allow the calculation of the feed balance and the knowledge of the status of the grassland. This favors the determination of the most adequate management methods for the grassland and/or the animal supplementation. Precisely, in regards to the animal, some indices may be used to know the sustainability and efficiency of this factor and of the system, in general. Besides those referred to the productions per animal, per unit of area, the reproduction and the health, we propose practical indices that play a decisive role in the monitoring of the animal component. They correspond to the creation of the curve of relative minimum potential to plan milk yield and estimate its efficiency and to the body condition that allows knowing the physical state of the herd and the thoracic perimeter, required for estimating the liveweight and the daily gain. Of course, if the minimum necessary records are kept in the exploitation systems, together with the indices mentioned, the biological and economical analysis may be conducted within the integral analysis of the system to take the necessary measures that guarantee the adequate efficiency and sustainability.

AB The study was developed on the basis of the results from numerous investigations on the management of grazing animals and their most efficient exploitation in subtropical conditions, primarily in Cuba. The fundamental principles of grassland management and exploitation are stated, those referred to the adjustment of some classical principles, as well as to new principles. The main result is the proposal of the Efficient and Sustainable Rotational Grazing (ESRG) for the American subtropics without irrigation, as a result of its principles and benefits. The application of these principles in an integral and harmonious form, according to the method proposed (ESRG), is recommended. This will permit more efficiency in the cattle system, especially for milk production in the American tropics without irrigation, in which the fundamental basis of the diet is pastures and the general principles are fulfilled to have more efficiency in their management and exploitation.

TI Forestry sector reform and distributional change of natural resource
   rent in Indonesia
SO DEVELOPING ECONOMIES
LA English
DT Article
AB After the collapse of the centralized Soeharto regime, deforestation caused by over-logging accelerated. To tackle this problem, an IMF/World Bank-led forestry sector reform program adopted a market-friendly approach involving the resumption of round wood exports and raising of the resource rent fee, with the aim to stop rent accumulation by plywood companies, which had enjoyed a supply of round wood at privileged prices. The Indonesian government, for its part, decentralized the forest concession management system to provide incentives for local governments and communities to carry out sustainable forest management. However, neither policy reform worked effectively. The round wood export ban was reimposed and the forest management system centralized again with cooperation from a newly funded industry-led institution. In the midst of the confusion surrounding the policy reversal, the gap between the price of round wood in international and domestic markets failed to contract, although rent allocations to plywood companies were reduced during 1998-2003. The rents were not collected properly by the government, but accumulated unexpectedly in the hands of players in the black market for round wood.

AB Bolivia's rate of deforestation throughout the 1990s was among the most rapid anywhere in the Amazon Basin. This drastic clearing stood in sharp contrast to the relatively slow rates of landscape change that had prevailed in previous decades. This article reviews the models used for explaining deforestation, and argues that the new context of globalization, structural adjustment, regional integration and rapid technological change contributed to accelerated forest cutting during the 1990s. The author suggests that many environmental policy approaches developed during the 1970s and 1980s no longer address the current clearing situation effectively, and that today's frontiers differ profoundly from previous ones. The widely held idea that intensive production per se reduces forest destruction may not be valid on tropical agro-industrial frontiers, such as the soybean zones of Bolivia and Brazil.

AB Biological "hot spots" are regions within a fishery that possess a larger growth potential than the surrounding areas. This paper analyzes how these biological hot spots influence the optimal bioeconomic marine reserve formation within a fishery. The presence of biological hot spots within a fishery creates an environment within which it is optimal to establish a marine reserve that increases the productivity and therefore the value of the fishery. This result is analyzed using heterogeneity in the intrinsic growth rates and carrying capacities within a fishery. Simulation results illustrate that the optimal reserve size in the presence of biological hot spots depends not only on the productive capacity of the reserve and the surrounding fishing grounds, but also on the degree of heterogeneity between the two regions.

AB Policy choice and policy design need to take account of transaction costs in order to increase the efficiency and sustainability of policies. However, transaction costs must first be measured to be included in the evaluation of alternative environmental or natural resource policies. While a number of studies measure transaction costs, there has been no systematic treatment of the fundamental issues involved. This article examines the issues involved in transaction cost measurement and makes recommendations regarding a typology of costs as well as the measurement methodologies themselves. In particular, methods used for nonmarket valuation of environmental goods may have potential for the measurement of transaction costs. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE species richness; ethnobotany; forage; food; multi-purpose species
AB A survey of plant biodiversity and ethnobotanical studies was conducted in southern Ethiopia using an integrated approach of botanical collections, group discussions, interviews and questionnaires. Species richness, growth forms and uses of native wild plants are described. Borana pastoralists distinguished and named 86% of the plant species identified. A total of 327 plant species distributed among 197 genera and 69 families are documented: 40% are trees/shrubs, 30% forbs (non-woody plants other than grasses and sedges), 16% grasses, 10% climbers, 2% sedges and 2% succulents. Based on richness of species and usefulness, the most important families are Poaceae, Fabaceae, Lamiaceae and Asteraceae. Two hundred forty-eight species (76%a) are used by Borana pastoralists, out of which 42% have multiple uses. Indigenous knowledge of pastoralists on use and management of their plant resources is a valuable source of information for conservation and sustainable utilization of the plant biodiversity and, hence, conservation based on indigenous knowledge is recommended.

AB Buildings account for more than 30% of Green house gas (GHG) emissions generated in Canada [1]. Canada Post Corporation (CPC) occupies 3223 buildings, and as a result has the opportunity to make a significant positive impact on the environment through energy conservation.
   In accordance with the corporation's environmental policy and with a proactive strategy, Canada Post has several long-term programs dating back to 1992 that have resulted in reduced energy consumption, and therefore reduced GHG's. Recently the corporation has introduced several new energy management initiatives. In order to support the commitment, energy conservation strategies have been developed. It is anticipated that CPC will be achieving 33% reduction in GHG emissions by 2010 [2].
   Energy conservation has financial benefits related to energy cost savings. However, CPC believes that cost savings are an important benefit, but not the reason behind the decision to pursue a strong energy conservation policy.
   Companies like Canada Post are important to Canada's future in its ability to achieve its Kyoto commitment, but more importantly there is an opportunity to exercise environmental responsibility. Canada Post has adopted a leadership position and in doing so has demonstrated a corporate will to contribute to the environmental well being of the world. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The purpose of this study is to discuss the participation of Brazilian air transportation within the context of global climate change. It first briefly presents an inventory of CO:! emissions caused by airborne activities in Brazil and then shows a trend projection through to 2023, indicating the progress of these emissions, with eight possible mitigation strategies. The abatement potential for each of these strategies is also investigated. It is estimated that joint implementation of all these strategies within a typical projection of broad based sustainability (based on renewable energy sources with fair social., economic and technological development) could result in an annual reduction in CO2 emissions caused by airborne activities in Brazil up to 28.5% (compared to the trend projection for 2023). It is also estimated that the emissions avoided through joint implementation of the mitigation alternatives analyzed may well reach 82,000 Gg (or 10(9) g) of CO2 from 2003 through 2023.

ID SUSTAINABILITY
AB The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is one of the most dynamic economic regions of the world. Its economy is linked with its diverse energy resources, high-level urbanization, and rapid industrialization. ASEAN's growing economy in the last two decades has increased the concern of sustainable development in the face of deteriorating energy security, environmental pollution, and economic hardship in energy investment. However, opportunities exist to tackle these issues. Increasing energy efficiency (both supply and demand side), exploitation of renewable energy resources (mostly hydro), and an integrated approach on energy resource management are some of the important approaches toward the sustainable energy path. Because the options are capital-intensive, cooperation and development of appropriate institutional structures and decision mechanism across the region are urgently needed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In embarking on a dynamic course of economic development and industrial modernism, Malaysia sees the need to increase its electricity generation capacity through the development of a mega-dam project - the Bakun dam. Although hydroelectricity generation offers one of the benign options in accommodating the increasing energy consumption per capita in Malaysia, it is argued that the construction of Bakun's dam which involves a complete and irreversible destruction of 69,640 ha of old forest ecosystem remains a difficult and uncertain endeavour. It is further argued that apart from mega-dam technology, there are also other means to orchestrate a sustainable energy system in Malaysia. These include the implementation of demand and supply initiatives, such as the deployment of energy saving technology or influencing behavioral change towards a sustainable energy consumption pattern.

AB The gasification of biomass is a thermochemical process, which results in a high production of gaseous products and small quantities of char and ash. Steam reforming of hydrocarbons, partial oxidation of heavy oil residues, selected steam reforming of aromatic compounds, and gasification of coals and solid wastes to yield a mixture of H-2 and CO (syngas), followed by water-gas shift reaction to produce H-2 and CO2, are well established processes. Hydrogen is a sustainable, non-polluting source of energy that can be used in mobile and stationary applications. The samples, both untreated and impregnated with K2CO3, were pyrollyzed from 298 K (initial temperature) to 650, 672, 700, 725, 750, 775, 800, 825, 850, 875, 900, 925, 950, 97, 1000 and 1025 K, and 975, 1075, 1175 and 1225 K temperatures. Alkali pyrolytic runs were carried out in the presence of 10.0, 20.0, 30.0 and 50.0 wt% K2CO3 of used shell sample. Steam gasification runs were carried out at 925, 975, 1025, 1075, 1175 and 1225 K temperatures. The ratios of water-to-hazelnut shell sample (W/HS) were 0.7 and 1.9 in steam gasification runs. The total volume and the yield of gas from both pyrolysis increase with increasing temperature. The highest hydrogen-rich gas yields were obtained from the alkali (30% K2CO3) at 1025 K and from steam gasification (W/HS = 1.9) at 1225 K runs.

TI Optimizing public transit quality and system access: the multiple-route,

SO ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING B-PLANNING & DESIGN
LA English
DT Article
ID SURFACE; MODEL; DESIGN; TOUR
AB Public transit service is a promising travel mode because of its potential to address urban sustainability. However, current ridership of public transit is very low in most urban regions-particularly those in the United States. Low transit ridership can be attributed to many factors, among which poor service quality is key. Transit service quality may potentially be improved by decreasing the number of service stops, but this would be likely to reduce access coverage. Improving transit service quality while maintaining adequate access coverage is a challenge facing public transit agencies. In this paper we propose a multiple-route, maximal covering/shortest-path model to address the trade-off between public transit service quality and access coverage in an established bus-based transit system. The model is applied to routes in Columbus, Ohio. Results show that it is possible to improve transit service quality by eliminating redundant or underutilized service stops.

ID SPATIAL PREDICTION; RANGE
AB We introduce a methodology to infer zones of high potential for the habitat of a species, useful for management of biodiversity, conservation, biogeography, ecology, or sustainable use. Inference is based on a set of sites where the presence of the species has been reported. Each site is associated with covariate values, measured on discrete scales. We compute the predictive probability that the species is present at each node of a regular grid. Possible spatial bias for sites of presence is accounted for. Since the resulting posterior distribution does not have a closed form, a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm is implemented. However, we also describe an approximation to the posterior distribution, which avoids MCMC. Relevant features of the approach are that specific notions of data acquisition such as sampling intensity and detectability are accounted for, and that available a priori information regarding areas of distribution of the species is incorporated in a clear-cut way. These concepts, arising in the presence-only context, are not addressed in alternative methods. We also consider an uncertainty map, which measures the variability for the predictive probability at each node on the grid. A simulation study is carried out to test and compare our approach with other standard methods. Two case studies are also presented. (c) 2005 Springer Science + Business Media, Inc.

ID PROPERTY-RIGHTS; BIODIVERSITY; CONSERVATION; PARKS
AB The World Conservation Union (IUCN) plays a global leadership role in defining different types of protected areas, and influencing how protected area systems develop and are managed. Following the 1992 World Parks Congress, a new system of categorizing protected areas was developed. New categories were introduced, including categories that allowed resource extraction. Since that time there has been rapid growth in the global numbers and size of protected areas, with most growth being shown in the new categories. Furthermore, the IUCN has heralded a 'new paradigm' of protected areas, which became the main focus of the 2003 World Parks Congress. The paradigm focuses on benefits to local people to alleviate poverty, re-engineering protected areas professionals, and an emphasis on the interaction between humans and nature through a focus on the new IUCN protected area categories. The purpose of this paper is to examine critically the implications of the new categories and paradigm shift in light of the main purpose of protected areas, to protect wild biodiversity. Wild biodiversity will not be well served by adoption of this new paradigm, which will devalue conservation biology, undermine the creation of more strictly protected reserves, inflate the amount of area in reserves and place people at the centre of the protected area agenda at the expense of wild biodiversity. Only IUCN categories I-IV should be recognized as protected areas. The new categories, namely culturally modified landscapes (V) and managed resource areas (VI), should be reclassified as sustainable development areas. To do so would better serve both the protection of wild biodiversity and those seeking to meet human needs on humanized landscapes where sustainable development is practised.

AB Although the importance of hedgerows for sustainable agriculture and conservation of rural biodiversity is increasingly being recognized, obtaining insight into the spatial and temporal dynamics of hedgerow networks remains an important challenge for landscape ecologists, with the key factors driving changes in rural landscape structure especially deserving further attention. The present study analyses the long-term history of a hedgerow network landscape in Flanders, Belgium. A detailed reconstruction of the hedgerow network is made at five points in time, starting at the end of the 18th century until present, for 367 distinct 400 m x 400 m samples. Whilst hedgerows were mainly concentrated around historical village centres and within valleys at the end of 18th century, the network expanded progressively during the 19th century. In the 20th century, the hedgerow network degraded strongly, with hedgerow density and connectivity declining and mesh-size heterogeneity and network fragmentation increasing, although the network recovered slightly during the 1990s. Different trajectories of change in hedgerow network structure were observed depending on landscape position, with both topography and village proximity significantly affecting hedgerow network dynamics. The present network structure was mainly governed by land use, with highly developed networks being predominantly associated with pasture. Three main conclusions arise from the results of this study. First, the role of land use and landscape position as basic factors steering hedgerow network dynamics at the landscape scale is demonstrated. Second, the long-term perspective of the study enabled insight into the poorly known expansion phase of hedgerow networks, linked mainly with the development of small-scale labour-intensive agriculture. Finally, the findings confirm the large-scale degradation of linear semi-natural habitats in European agricultural landscapes during most of the 20th century, and indicate that a pro-active rural policy can halt and even reverse this process.

AB Conflict between wildlife and people can erode local support for conservation. Wildlife-based benefits are intended to offset costs and encourage tolerance or stewardship, but where the linkage between benefits and wildlife is not understood, benefits may be ineffective at bolstering conservation. In Laikipia, Kenya, wildlife and areas devoted to wildlife are on the increase, but most residents still suffer losses to wildlife and derive minimal benefits. The elephant situation is particularly problematic because elephants may compete with livestock for resources, raid people's crops, and chase and kill livestock and people. Although most unprotected elephant range in East Africa is in semi-arid rangelands occupied by pastoralists, previous research has emphasized agricultural, not pastoral or agri-pastoral conflicts. Between 1999 and 2002, interviews were conducted in Laikipia District to examine whether pastoralists also experience conflict, and to determine whether wildlife conservation provided appreciable benefits to residents, or fostered pro-conservation attitudes among residents. Three properties, Endana, Koija and Mpala, were selected to include the two primary land uses in Laikipia (livestock and agriculture) and two levels of wildlife-based benefits (indirect benefits and direct benefits from a locally-owned tourism operation). People were negative about many aspects of local wildlife conservation, especially animals that raided crops or were dangerous. Fundamental differences in attitudes were attributable to primary land use; within ethnic groups, people practising agriculture were less tolerant of elephants than people practising pastoralism. Despite evidence that elephants may compete with livestock for forage, ecological competition was not a primary concern among cattle-keeping people. In communities that received indirect benefits from tourism or wildlife, the connection between wildlife and employment or aid in kind was usually overlooked. Unlike elsewhere in Africa, education and wealth did not correlate with positive attitudes towards wildlife because the tourism programme was improving the situation and the outlook of people lacking education and material wealth. Pastoral people with indirect financial benefits expressed positive attitudes towards elephants for aesthetic reasons, while pastoral people with direct benefits cited financial rewards derived from tourism but attributed aesthetic values to living with elephants. The programme in the pastoral community receiving benefits was exemplary in that benefits were tangible, and the participants appreciated the linkage between benefits and active conservation. Land conversion from pastoralism to agriculture threatens elephant survival, not only in terms of habitat loss, but also in terms of lost tolerance among people who have shifted to farming.

AB New forest policies in South Africa seek to reconcile conservation and development objectives by devolving some responsibility for forest management from the state to local communities. Community participation in forest management aims to protect forest-based subsistence livelihoods by incorporating the interests of resource users, while simultaneously diffusing threats to biodiversity by managing resource use. To date, participatory forest management (PFM) has had mixed success in South Africa because the transfer of rights to users has not accompanied changes in policy. A questionnaire survey of 60 households (43%) revealed the attitudes of users toward current management and conservation options for iGxalingenwa forest. Users chose participatory forest management (52%) over community (25%) or state-dominated forest management (2%) structures. User choice was motivated by the desire to secure rights of access to, and ensure equitable benefit from, a dwindling resource base, rather than the conservation of these resources to sustain future yields. Users were unwilling to reduce resource use and compromise usufruct rights to achieve conservation goals, even to improve the availability of the resource stock. Current user needs compromise biodiversity conservation goals, and users regard state conservation practices as protectionist and obstructing their rights of access to resources. While the National Forests Act of 1998 seeks to conserve resources by limiting access to them and is based on principles of sustainable use, it is nevertheless perceived to offer few incentives to users to participate in forest management and conservation. Ideally, an institutional and legal framework that allocates user rights and managerial responsibilities to households is required, but clearly suitable alternatives to forest products are also vital for successful management. Greater trust between the provincial parks authority and users is needed, but is complicated by weak traditional leadership and poor community representation. Ultimately, users preferred PFM because, while recognizing that harvest rates are unsustainable, user dependence upon forest resources and weak traditional leadership means they can protect usufruct rights only by participation. Changes to any of these factors may create demands for a new management system. PFM allows the greatest flexibility for responding to changes in demands as well as the environment.

AB Fuelwood is still the primary energy source for rural households across the savannah biome of Africa. Coppice growth is an important species-specific trait that strongly influences fuelwood production and regeneration, and yet coppice growth patterns are poorly understood in African savannahs. It is therefore vital that factors affecting coppice growth of species, such as environment conditions and harvesting technique, be better understood in order to develop models for sustainable fuelwood use. This study investigated coppice growth and resource allocation strategies in relation to (1) position along the landscape catena and (2) harvesting technique, for three savannah fuelwood tree species: Dichrostachys cinerea, Albizia harveyi and Combretum collinum. The study was conducted in a dystrophic semi-arid savannah in the far north-east of South Africa. A total of 1146 harvested stumps were sampled in topland and bottomland sites in three locations around a rural village. Stump characteristics (diameter and height) and coppice shoot variables (number of shoots, length and diameter of each shoot, length of longest shoot, and diameter of fattest shoot) were measured for each stump. Three soil samples were taken in each site for physical and chemical analysis. No statistically significant differences were found in soil variables between topland and bottomland sites, probably due to low sample size. Coppice resource allocation strategies varied between species. D. cinerea exhibited a 'quantity-driven' strategy, with the production of large numbers of relatively small coppice shoots with high length:diameter ratio (shoot taper function). C. collinum exhibited a 'quality-driven' strategy, characterized by the production of a relatively low number of larger coppice shoots. Coppice growth variables for A. harveyi were intermediate between those of the other two species, suggesting a strategy where allocation of resources to the number and growth of shoots is more balanced. However, allocation of resources relative to the size of the cut stem, indexed by total shoot basal area:stump basal area ratio, did not differ significantly between species. Coppice growth was strongly favoured in bottomland sites for D. cinerea, and to a lesser degree, C. collinum. Catenal position had a negligible influence on coppice growth of A. harveyi. Number of shoots produced increased with cutting height for all three species. For all three species the number of shoots increased with stump diameter, and mean shoot size also increased with stump size for D. cinerea. There was a significant negative relationship between stump diameter and total shoot basal area:stump basal area ratio for A. harveyi and C. collinum. A framework for optimizing different coppice growth variables according to species, catenal position and harvesting technique is given.

AB Stable associations of syntrophic fermentative organisms and populations that consume fermentation products play key roles in the anaerobic biodegradation of chlorinated organic contaminants. The involvement of these syntrophic populations is essential for mineralization of chlorinated aromatic compounds under methanogenic conditions. The fermentative production of low levels of hydrogen (H-2) can also be used to selectively deliver a limiting electron donor to dehalogenating organisms and achieve complete dehalogenation of chlorinated aliphatic contaminants such as tetrachloroethene. Thus, tracking the abundance of syntrophically coupled populations should aid in the development and monitoring of sustainable bioremediation strategies. In this study, two complementary nucleic acid-based methods were used to identify and assess relative changes or differences in the abundance of potentially important populations in complex anaerobic microbial communities that mineralized chlorinated aromatic compounds. Population dynamics were related to the consumption and production of key metabolic substrates, intermediates, and products. Syntrophus-like populations were detected in 3-chlorobenzoate-degrading communities derived from sediment or sludge digesters. In the presence of H-2-consuming populations, characterized Syntrophus species ferment benzoate, a central intermediate in the anaerobic metabolism of 3-chlorobenzoate and 2-chlorophenol. A DNA probe that targeted characterized Syntrophus species was developed and used to quantify rRNA extracted from the 3-chlorobenzoate- and 2-chlorophenol-degrading communities. The level of rRNA targeted by the Syntrophus-specific probe tracked with the formation of benzoate during metabolism of the parent compounds. Hybridizations with an Archaea-specific probe and/or measurement of methane production demonstrated that methanogens directly benefited from the influx of benzoate-derived electron donors, and the activities of Syntrophus-like and methanogenic populations in the contaminant-degrading communities were closely linked.

AB The purpose this study was to improve operational planning and management of national parks in Turkey to balance conservation use and sustainable management. Soguksu National Park (SNP) was chosen as the study area. The data were obtained from interviews of 182 visitor groups (in total, 819 people) and analyzed using correlation, factor, discriminant, and regression analyses. It was found that the most important factors affecting operational planning and management of SNP are (1) travel cost, (2) visitor welfare level, (3) intensity of use, (4) size of visitor group, (5) type of recreational demand. The main source of visitors to SNP is from a zone within a 0-90-km radius. This region comprised 53.85% of total visitors to the park. The capital of Turkey (Ankara) is the most important source of visitors from within this zone. The optimum activity mix in SNP is also determined. Picnicking, viewing the scenery, and nature walks or trekking comprised the main uses of the park. It is anticipated that these findings will help to improve operational planning and sustainable management of the national park and the environment.

SO ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT

ID SUSTAINABILITY INDICATORS; KNOWLEDGE
AB Environmental Management Systems (EMS) are being trialed for Australian agricultural industries as society becomes more concerned about agriculture's environmental performance. EMS is a structured approach used by farm businesses to assess, monitor, and improve environmental performance. Use of EMS in conjunction with other policy tools (such as financial incentives and regulation) in agriculture could enhance management of both on-farm and off-farm environmental issues. Based on the international standard ISO14001, EMS was designed to be applied at the individual business level. However, governments in Australia are exploring its potential to be applied at a catchment scale, among other things, for the purpose of linking farm-level actions to catchment targets. In Australia, governments and catchment management bodies are using Integrated Catchment Management (ICM) as the framework to try to achieve environmental targets set out in catchment plans. In this article, we compare aspects of the EMS and ICM frameworks and comment on the potential of using EMS to achieve catchment-scale environmental outcomes. We conclude that EMS could be a useful policy tool to improve farm management and to contribute, in part, to better off-site outcomes at the catchment/landscape scale. Recommendations on the use of EMS at the catchment scale are discussed. These include using an educational approach for EMS delivery, linking the EMS process to catchment targets, and ensuring catchment targets are realistic and achievable.

AB Stream discharge of a watershed is affected and altered by climate and landcover changes. These effects vary depending on the magnitude and interaction of the changes, and need to be understood so that local water resource availability can be evaluated and socioeconomic development within a watershed be pursued and managed in a way sustainable with the local water resources. In this study, the landcover and climate change effects on stream discharge from the Jacks Fork River basin in the Ozark Highlands of the south-central United States were examined in three phases: site observation and data collection, model calibration and simulation, and model experiment and analysis. Major results of the study show that climate fluctuations between wet and dry extremes resulted in the same change of the basin discharge regardless of the landcover condition in the basin. On the other hand, under a specified climate condition landcover change from a grassland basin to a fully forested basin only resulted in about one half of the discharge change caused by the climate variation. Furthermore, when landcover change occurred simultaneously with climate variation, the basin discharge change amplified significantly and became larger than the combined discharge changes caused by the climate and landcover change alone, a result indicating a synergistic effect of landcover and climate change on basin discharge variability.

AB This paper introduces the approach of the Systems research Network (SysNet) for land use planning in tropical Asia with a focus on its main scientific-technical output: the development of the land use planning and analysis system (LUPAS) and its component models. These include crop simulation models, expert systems, GIS, and multiple goal linear programming (MGLP) models for land evaluation and optimization. LUPAS was designed as a decision support system (DSS) for strategic land use planning. Integration of LUPAS components in four case studies was performed in a network with national research teams and local stakeholders. This network allowed iterative evaluation and refinement of LUPAS for scenario analysis on technical and policy changes. Several interactive sessions with stakeholders led to more detail in scenarios (goals and constraints), model features and databases. To facilitate negotiation among stakeholders, the MGLP user interface (UI) was developed. In interactive sessions, goal restrictions are tightened to quantify trade-offs between conflicting goals. Choice and degree of tightening reflect the specific priorities for sustainable land use. The development of LUPAS is exemplified for one case study, Ilocos Norte, Philippines. Weak points of the system include inadequate spatial differentiation of socio-economic characteristics, scarce database for quantifying perennials and mixed cropping systems, and insufficient consideration of long-term effects of production technologies on resource quality. However, a promising perspective for effective policy support lies in the possible link of the regional LUPAS approach with farm household models. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID SUSTAINABILITY
AB This study was aimed at determining the land-use and land-cover (LULC) potentials of a southeastern Mediterranean area (Antakya, Turkey) of 36 816 ha for a total of 23 different LULC types: nine horticultural crops, nine field crops and five non-agricultural lands. Land evaluation was carried out by using a combination of SENOL Land Evaluation System and ILSEN computer program adapted to Turkey from FAO land evaluation principles. Our assessment resulted in the identification of nine physiographical units, 27 different soil series, and 110 land mapping units. Nearly 49% of the study area was determined as suitable for agricultural land cover types, and 35% for non-agricultural land use types. A map showing potential suitability of LULC was derived for the study area. The quantification of LULC suitability assists decision makers in ensuring that lands are used according to their capacities to satisfy human needs for present and future generations, thus sustaining ecological and economic productivity of natural resources.

SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY

ID WALL CARBON NANOTUBES; PULMONARY TOXICITY
AB Due to advances in nanotechnology, the approach to catalytic design is transitioning from trial-and-error to planned design and control. Expected advances should enable the design and construction of catalysts to increase reaction speed, yield, and catalyst durability while also reducing active species loading levels. Nanofabrication techniques enabling precise control over the shape, size, and position of nanoscale platinum-group metal (PGM) particles in automotive catalysts should result in reduced PGM loading levels. These reductions would decrease energy consumption, improve environmental quality, and contribute to sustainable resource usage. We estimate the amount of PGM required to meet U.S. vehicle emissions standards through 2030 based on current catalysttechnology. We then estimate the range of PGM that could be saved from potential nanotechnology advances. Finally, we employ economic input-output and process-based life cycle assessment models to estimate the direct and life cycle benefits from reducing PGM mining and refining.

ID SOLONETZIC COMPLEX; REGION; SOILS
AB An important contribution of A.F. Bol'shakov to the elaboration of the main ways and methods of adaptive nature management under the conditions of a semidesert with clay soils (the northern Caspian Lowland, Dzhanybek Station of the Institute of Forestry, Russian Academy of Sciences) is shown. The studies revealed that agro-forest meliorative systems might be created only in some local areas of virgin landscapes. The water supply of crops and forest plantations can be improved due to snow accumulation that is regulated by the mean distance of transferring snow particles during snowstorms. Methods of ecologically inexhaustible and socio-economically sustainable nature management, including the arrangement of local field-protecting forest systems on soils of the solonetzic complex are described. The suggested set of measures is aimed at higher crop production and establishment of local forest-pasture areas for the improvement of herbage using long-lived forest plantations only in depressions, as well as growing stable recreation forests in large flat depressions.

AB Uncertainties about future states of wildlife populations make it difficult to pre-adapt to possible threats and ensure sustainability of resources and harvesting over the long term. This uncertainty is partly due to the unknown impact and future states of many factors that explain population sizes and variation. In this paper, the effect of local game management activities on the uncertainty of future population sizes of groups of Finnish wildlife species (ungulates, forest grouse, large predators, small predators and mountain hare) was analysed using expert knowledge and the Bayesian belief networks (BBNs) modelling techniques. As a result, the current knowledge and agreement of the relationships between wildlife population sizes and the game management activities explaining their variation as well as trends are evaluated. Information given to hunters and the number of hunters were seen as the most effective factors for the management of game populations. However, there were great uncertainties in the expectations regarding future trends in the management activities, especially in feeding, and there was disagreement in the direction of the trend in the length of the hunting season. The trends in the size of forest grouse populations were viewed as the most uncertain trend among species groups. At the same time, forest grouse were seen as the most regulated species group by local game management. Among interest variables, experts were very uncertain and they disagreed about the direction of the trend in the recreational value of hunting.

AB This paper proposes that responsibility is better understood as an aesthetic rather than as an ethical construct. It suggests that aesthetics is a distinctively European way of conceptualizing 'cooperation and responsible management', but nevertheless finds conditions that will internationalize this conceptualization soon. It also maintains that it is how responsibility is secured that determines whether cooperation is seen as appealing or repulsive. Finding in aesthetics a measure to determine whether managers enable cooperation responsibly, it argues that the aesthetics of managing cooperation responsibly can no longer be ignored.

AB We report that autonomous oscillations, which usually happen in aerobic glucose-limited continuous cultures of yeast at low dilution rate, were also observed in trehalose discontinuous cultures of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This unexpected oscillatory behaviour was therefore examined using fast Fourier transformation of online gas measurements. This robust mathematical analysis underlined the existence of two types of oscillation. The first was found to be linked to the cell cycle because (a) the periodicity corresponded to a fraction of the generation time and (b) the oscillations were accompanied by a transient increase in the budding index, mobilization of storage carbohydrates, and fermentative activity. Moreover, these oscillations occurred in a range of specific growth rates between 0.04 and 0.15 h(-1). All these criteria were consistent with the cell-cycle-related metabolic oscillations observed in the same range of growth rates in glucose-limited continuous cultures. The second type were short-period respiratory oscillations, independent of the specific growth rate. Both types of oscillation were found to take place consecutively and/or simultaneously during batch culture on trehalose. In addition, mobilization of intracellular trehalose emerged as a key parameter for the sustainability of these autonomous oscillations as they were no longer observed in a mutant defective in neutral trehalase activity. We propose that batch culture on trehalose may be an excellent device for further investigation of the molecular mechanisms that underlie autonomous oscillations in yeast.

TI Benefits of forests in Cameroon. Global structure, issues involving
   access and decision-making hiccoughs
SO FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
DE access to forestry fees; insecurity; inequity; 'Forestry elite';
   conflicts; decision-making enforcement; collaborative options
AB Among many other stakes, the economic stake derived from the exploitation of tropical forest resources is a burning issue. This is evidenced by insecurity in intergenerational access to forest resources and financial benefits relating to the latter, on the one hand, and by a deep iniquity at the intra-generational level, on the other hand. The following paper highlights, as a moral, social and policy dilemma, how stakeholders and generations, 'self-interested', mark out access to forest resources and to financial benefits relating to the latter. Through intensive participatory research, quantitative data collection, participant observation, future scenarios and some International Forestry Research's social science methods and interactive games (SSM & IG) based on the evaluation of the sustainability of forest management systems, field research conducted in the forest zone of Cameroon on access to forest resources has generated two central results. Firstly, future generations will be confronted-in a dramatic way to quantitative and qualitative scarcity of forest resources, following their over exploitation by present generations. Secondly, as concerns the intra-generational access benefits generated by commercial exploitation of forests and the assessment of the circulation of forestry fees, there is much inequity, in as much as those benefits are more profitable to a 'forestry elite'-a self-interested block'- than to local communities, who strongly claim to have historical rights over these forests. As a contribution of social science to public knowledge and to policy development, this article is nourishing 'rational choice' and 'rational egoism' theory and is targeting decision-making processes in the ever first attempt of forest management decentralization and 'legal' benefits sharing in Central Africa (the second largest forest of the World). The article recommends the shortening of the distance between decision-making and beneficiaries, downwardly accountability, 'bottom-up' mechanisms of public dialogue in forest management and a collaborative infrastructure in the circulation and the distribution of forest benefits.

TI Monitoring Canada's forests: The National Forest Inventory
SO FORESTRY CHRONICLE
LA English
DT Article
DE Canada; forest cover; inventory; monitoring; National Forest Inventory;
   re-measurement; panel
AB A new national forest inventory is being installed in Canada. For the last 20 years, Canada's forest inventory has been a compilation of inventory data from across the country. Although this method has a number of advantages, it lacks information about the nature and rate of changes to the resource, and does not permit projections or forecasts. To address these limitations a new National Forest Inventory (NFI) was developed to monitor Canada's progress in meeting a commitment towards sustainable forest management, and to satisfy requirements for national and international reporting. The purpose of the new inventory is to "assess and monitor the extent, state and sustainable development of Canada's forests in a timely and accurate manner." The NFI consists of a plot-based system of permanent observational units located on a national grid. A combination of ground plot, photo plot and remote sensing data are used to capture a set of basic attributes that are used to derive indicators of sustainability. To meet the monitoring needs a re-measurement strategy and framework to guide the development of change estimation procedures has been worked out. A plan for implementation has been drafted. The proposed plan is presented and discussed in this paper.

AB This paper provides an overview of methods for assessing forest sustainability, and describes an extranet World Wide Web forest assessment system. A general assessment approach, multi-criteria analysis (MCA), is briefly described. One of the MCA methods, the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), which is the method used for the computer-assisted assessment system, is described in more detail. The primary MCA/AHP innovation is multi-stakeholder assessment with a stratification process. This web-distributed assessment system, that was designed to meet Ontario's provincial state of the forest criteria and indicators forest health assessment need, may be suitable for use in other jurisdictions with similar conditions.

ID SOCIALLY SUSTAINABLE FOREST; LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
AB To test public perception and preference of forest fragmentation trends under current forest management practices, we solicited preferences for harvest patterns from 63 study participants before and after they were provided with educational material on the subject. In addition, we solicited preferences for harvest systems employing different retention patterns. Participants preferred harvest patterns tending away from small, dispersed harvest blocks (i.e., more fragmented) towards larger, more aggregated harvest blocks (i.e., less fragmented). This preference was more pronounced when participants were provided with information that stressed a less fragmented pattern as being ecologically beneficial. This result suggests that the public is willing to accept larger, more aggregated harvest blocks relative to the status quo, especially if provided with information that stresses benefits of that approach. However, participants clearly preferred a harvest system employing dispersed individual tree retention over other systems employing a more concentrated retention pattern. The combination of these results suggests that public acceptability of larger aggregated harvest blocks may depend on the amount of post-harvest retention involved, and that harvest systems employing dispersed individual tree retention will be preferred by the public.

TI Towards the age of corporate responsibility? Emerging challenges for the
   business world
SO FUTURES
LA English
DT Article
AB The article seeks to show how the issue of ethical corporations can be examined and challenged through the concept of corporate responsibility. Corporate responsibility first emerged as a term around 10 years ago with the rise of environmental reporting systems. At that time, the UNCED summit in Rio boosted the general level of consciousness concerning these issues and the first business-driven international organisation to tackle the field, Business Council for Sustainable Development, emerged. Globalisation, which by any indicators accelerated enormously during the 1990s, has challenged corporations to consider responsibility in a new light. The evolution and spread of a global network of finance have increased the need for transparency and responsibility, at the same time as the shift from 'international' to 'global' signified the gradual breakdown of old institutions and the emergence of new ones. This article evaluates how corporations have responded to this challenge and postulates, in the light of increasing pressures on human and natural conditions, a coming 'Age of Responsibility' that will set corporate responsibility a basis for any action in business world.

DT Article
AB 'Corporate Social Responsibility' (CSR) has become the mainstream prescription by business and governments for dealing with social and environmental ills. It is a voluntary form of self-regulation that aims to tackle everything from human rights and labour standards to limiting carbon dioxide emissions that lead to climate change. But because CSR ultimately lies within the framework of markets, and requires market-based incentives for companies to invest in such programmes, it ultimately falls prey to the vagaries of the market. The myths of CSR include that voluntary reporting improves performance; that codes and management systems change corporate behaviour; the consumer will drive change and that the investment community will provide the best incentive for business to perform in a more sustainable manner. Re-envisioning ethical business requires us to look at opportunities below the radar screen: not at minimising the impacts of big business. Understanding and providing the institutions to support the 'ethical minnows': those business that operate on a sustainable platform and provide a social return on investment, beyond mere financial profit. Ultimately, we need to transform markets in such a way as to see an end to the larger corporate winner-takes-all approach if we are to see a sustainable future. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Biofertilizer has been identified as an alternative to chemical fertilizer to increase soil Fertility and crop production in sustainable farming. The objective of this greenhouse study was to evaluate the effects of four biofertilizers containing an arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus (Glomus mosseae or Glomus intraradices) with or without N-fixer (Azotobacter chroococcum), P solubilizer (Bacillus megaterium) and K solubilizer (Bacillus mucilaginous) on soil properties and the growth of Zea mays. The application treatments included control (no fertilizer), chemical fertilizer. organic fertilizer and two types of biofertilizer. The application of biofertilizer containing mycorrhizal fungus and three species of bacteria significantly increased the growth of Z mays. The use of biofertilizer (G. mosseae and three bacterial species) resulted in the highest biomass and seeding height. This greenhouse study also indicated that half the amount of biofertilizer application had similar effects when compared with organic fertilizer or chemical fertilizer treatments. Microbial inoculum not only increased the nutritional assimilation of plant (total N, P and K), but also improved soil properties, such as organic matter content and total N in soil. The arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) had a higher root infection rate in the presence of bacterial inoculation. By contrast, the AMF seemed to have an inhibiting effect oil the P-solubilizing bacteria. The nutrient deficiency in soil resulted in a larger population of N-fixing bacteria and higher colonization of AMF. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The expansion of modern agriculture in developing countries presents numerous challenges for environmental policy makers. Environmental policies for agriculture in north-eastern Brazil's soybean belt are analyzed, with emphasis on the role of a non-state actor in leading policy reforms. An organization representing large farmers is leading policy reforms to reduce the environmental impacts of modern agriculture. By contrast, state agencies are relatively weak and ineffective. The analysis situates this question conceptually in literatures stressing the political and structural causes of corporate environmentalism and literatures explaining the increasingly strong role of non-state actors in environmental governance. The case study focuses on the content of reforms, reasons why the non-state actor is so prominent, and the implications of policy reforms. State agencies face major challenges in environment-agriculture policy debates in places where environmental subsidies are unlikely, environmental information is poor, and organized private interests are influential.

SO GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL

DT Article
DE West Africa; Mali; cotton; political ecology; poverty; soil degradation
AB This study examines the hypothesis that poor households engage in less sustainable soil management practices than rich households in a similar socioeconomic environment. This broad objective is explored in Mali's southern cotton belt through three specific research questions. First, is there empirical evidence to support the claim that poor households engage in less sustainable soil management practices than rich households? Second, what local and extra-local factors influence household agricultural management approaches in southern Mali? Third, what broader scale political and economic processes are linked to the factors that influence local-level agricultural management approaches? The author reports that soil quality measures on the farms of rich and poor households are not significantly different, refuting the conventional wisdom that the wealthy are better managers of the environment. A variety of environmentally deleterious practices are associated with export-oriented cotton production, an activity more vigorously pursued by wealthy than poor farmers. Finally, the focus on poverty in international environment and development discourse has allowed the government of Mali to avoid a serious debate on the sustainability of cotton production. The study's findings are based on household interviews describing agricultural management practices, an analysis of farm field soil measures, and discussions with donors and national policymakers.

SO GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL

ID GROWTH
AB Attitudes to population policy taken by major international institutions display a lack of symmetry. Population-based institutions forcefully set out the effects of population on development and human welfare. In contrast, institutions and lobbies concerned with hunger, poverty and environment, brought together at the 2003 World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg, treat population growth as a given, independent, variable. This paper gives a land resources viewpoint. It includes a case study of Malawi and cross-country statistical comparisons. Official estimates of the extent of spare land, cultivable but not presently cultivated, are challenged. It is concluded that in low-income, food-deficit countries population increase has reduced, in some areas nullified, advances in agricultural development. Following the 1994 UN Conference on Population and Development in Cairo, a set of ethically acceptable measures for reducing population growth received general acceptance. All concerned with poverty, hunger and environment should follow the policy road from Cairo to Johannesburg. If greater efforts are not made to reduce rates of population increase, the targets of the Millennium declaration will not be met, and the suffering which these cause will continue. Statements about agriculture, food security, poverty and sustainability should recognize that population is not an external variable but an integral part of development.

AB Technology and geography have developed at the same time. Several different eras based on technological change can be identified Common threads can be found in the development and the use of lantern slides, films, broadcasting and the internet that have promoted or hindered their development and use in schools. Furthermore, the development of the Geographical Association (GA) can be associated with these technological changes. The use of technology offers many new and exciting ways, of learning and teaching which are as yet not fully utilised This article argues that 'shaped' and sustainable technologies could be the way forward.

   re-building rural livelihoods in the Eastern Province
SO GEOGRAPHY

DT Article
AB Sierra Leone has recently emerged from a long period of political instability and civil war which has relegated the country to the bottom of the world human development league table. A process of reconstruction and rehabilitation is now underway, to restore livelihoods, repair damaged infrastructure and rebuild the economy The sustainable development of valuable mineral resources and the restoration qf rural production systems and food security are important priorities. This article examines the post-war reconstruction process and presents evidence from communities in the Eastern Province which were badly affected during the conflict. Although some progress is being made, the pace qf change is slow, and the threat of a return to instability is a common concern among all citizens and organisations, from national government to individuals and communities at the grassroots level.

AB Debris-flow hazard assessment schemes are commonly based on empirical, physical, or numerical methods and techniques. Inherent in all methods is generally the assumption of unlimited sediment supply. This study compares model inputs of sediment requirements for debris flows with estimated sediment reproduction from both solifluction and rockwall retreat. The analysis is carried out in Bildudalur, a community in the Westfjords of Iceland. Geomorphic techniques are applied to determine the set of natural processes acting in this landscape to estimate spatial distribution of relevant processes, to approximate level of processes activity, and to provide information for scenario modeling. Debris-flow volumes are determined by coupling rainfall magnitudes and catchment sizes with average sediment contents. Rockwall retreat and solifluction rates are based on literature reviews.
   For a rainstorm with a 10-year return period, debris-flow volumes are calculated for 12 different creeks. Rates are assumed for solifluction with a velocity of 0.25 m/yr at an average depth of 0.5 in and for rockwall retreat with 2 mm/yr. Comparing sediment requirements with estimated sediment reproduction leads to a factor of deficit ranging between 6.2 and 8.5. Thus, the sediment storage is not refilled as fast as the next potential triggering rainfall occurs. Consequently, if a debris flow has occurred in the past, all sediment is removed, and the following rainstorm event is 'just' causing a flood, which is by far less destructive than a debris-flow event. The challenge of future debris-flow hazard-assessment schemes is to include geomorphic analysis to be able to obtain more sustainable results. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE Jeju Island; basalt; groundwater; water level; Korea
AB Jeju Island is a volcanic one composed predominantly of permeable basalts. The water resources of the island are dependent almost entirely on groundwater. It is essential to fully understand the hydrogeological conditions of the aquifer systems for proper and sustainable development of groundwater resources. Groundwater characteristics, including water levels and aquifer parameters in the island were evaluated using extensively collected hydrogeologic data. Groundwater levels on the island were located in a range between -26 and 282 m above sea level. Groundwater levels in the northern and southern basins are generally higher than those in the eastern and western basins. Fluctuation patterns of groundwater levels and ECs were classified into three types: sinusoidal fluctuations of both water level and EC, sinusoidal fluctuation of water level only, and no distinct fluctuation pattern. Generally, there were higher groundwater yields in coastal areas than inland areas. The groundwater was most productive in the trachybasalts and basal groundwater areas. This paper is providing a summary of several investigations on the hydrogeological characteristics of the aquifers in the island.
